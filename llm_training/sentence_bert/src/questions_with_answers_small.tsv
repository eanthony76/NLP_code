Gerry Goffin, a hit songwriter and former husband of Carole King, died early Thursday. He was 75.  Together with King, he wrote such classics as "The Loco-Motion," "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" and "Up on the Roof."  King described Goffin as her first love.  "He had a profound impact on my life and the rest of the world. Gerry was a good man and a dynamic force, whose words and creative influence will resonate for generations to come," she said in a statement.  "His words expressed what so many people were feeling but didn't know how to say. If you want to join his loved ones in honoring him, look at the names of the songwriters under the titles of songs," King added.  The lyricist died at home of natural causes, according to a statement from his publicity agency.  Goffin's repertoire of hits ran across decades, from the early 1960s through the late 1990s, and includes some of the most familiar songs of modern times.  Born in Brooklyn, Goffin met King when they were students at Queens College, according to a biography on the Songwriters Hall of Fame website. They married in 1959.  Their big break came soon after with "Will You Love Me Tomorrow," which was recorded by The Shirelles. Luminaries like The Beatles and Whitney Houston also performed his songs.  Among Goffin's other hits are: "Saving All My Love For You" with Michael Masser, "Who Put The Bomp" with Barry Mann and "I've Got To Use My Imagination" with Barry Goldberg.  He is survived by his wife, Michele Goffin, five children and six grandchildren.  People we have lost in 2014  
 New Delhi Indian police have arrested a man who they say abducted a 5-year-old girl, kept her captive in his house and repeatedly raped her.  The girl was initially admitted to a hospital in her neighborhood, where doctors said they removed foreign objects from her genitals, including candle pieces and a small bottle.  The assault came barely months after a 23-year physiotherapy student was savagely gang-raped in a moving bus in an attack that triggered seething protests in the country. She later died at a Singapore hospital.  In the latest case, a neighbor abducted the girl, locked her in a house and brutally raped her repeatedly before she was found semiconscious three days later, according to police.  The suspect was arrested in Bihar state in eastern India and is being brought to New Delhi, city police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said.  The girl was later transferred to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital in New Delhi.  Her condition has stabilized, according to hospital spokesman Y.K. Gupta, who said she underwent surgery to help with her bowel movement.  The attack sparked protests in New Delhi on Friday. Many demonstrators are members of a political party of the leading anti-corruption activist, Arvind Kejriwal.  Criticized for what was seen as his late response to the December gang rape, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was quick to issue a statement this time, calling the act "shameful."  And as the nation's media ran footage of a police officer slapping a female protester, Singh also ordered strict action against the officer and anyone who roughed up demonstrators.  The girl went missing Sunday evening, her parents say, and police registered their report Monday.  She was found Wednesday in a house on the ground floor of her building.

U.S. President Obama sent a direct message to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei weeks before this month's disputed election, Iranian sources said Wednesday.  Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calls for an end to protests last week at Tehran University.  The letter requested dialogue and engagement between the two nations, the sources said.  The sources said that Khamenei has yet to reply to the letter but that nonetheless it "had set the negotiating table in order for both sides to sit around it after the election."  The White House refused to "get into the specifics of our different ways of communicating," a senior Obama administration official said.  "We have indicated a willingness to talk for a long time and have sought to communicate with the Iranians in a variety of ways," the official said.  Khamenei made an indirect reference to the letter in his sermon on Friday at Tehran University.  "The U.S. president said that we were waiting for a day like this to see people on the street," the Iranian leader said. "Some people attributed these remarks to Obama, and then they write letters to say we're ready to have ties, that we respect the Islamic Republic, and on the other hand, they make such comments. Which one should we believe?"  One Iranian source said, "We thought President Obama would send congratulations to President Ahmadinejad," and before the election, his senior advisers prepared a response to the anticipated note, which never came.  The Iranian source said the election dispute is wasting time on the issue of starting U.S.-Iranian negotiations.  Watch how the reported letter is part of a new policy of engagement   "The longer it is delayed," the source said, "the less likely [U.S.-Iranian talks] will happen."  Another Iranian government official said there is still "no trust" between Iran and the United States.  The source said he is waiting for "real change" even though the Iranian government welcomed the change in tone of the Obama administration before the current election turmoil in Iran. The official went on to cite a recent gesture by Iran toward Obama: the release of journalist Roxana Saberi.  The official said Iran accepted Obama's assurances that she was not a spy and had allowed the Iranian citizen to leave the country.  Since, under intense scrutiny amid growing concerns over Tehran's violent crackdown on street protests, Obama has sharpened his language on Iran.  "The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, beatings and imprisonments of the last few days," Obama said Tuesday, adding that he strongly condemns "these unjust actions."  He has not spoken in support of Ahmadinejad or his main rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, whose supporters have taken to the streets to protest the results of the June 12 election that gave Ahmadinejad a second term.  Obama's letter to Khamenei is in keeping with his publicly stated aim of engagement with Iran and his New Year's message in which he described a new way forward.  The Obama administration has "made it clear that any real dialoguemultilateral or bilateralneeded to be authoritative," according to the senior administration official.  The official noted that the Iranians have yet to respond to a diplomatic outreach made during talks on Iran's nuclear program April 8. At that time, the administration asked the European Union's international policy chief, Javier Solana, to invite Iran to new talks with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany.  But the administration's tack toward Iran may be changing, as senior officials in Washington said the Obama administration is seriously considering not extending further invitations to Iranian diplomats for July 4 celebrations overseas. Some invitations had been sent and will not be rescinded, senior administration officials said.  The officials said intense discussions on the issue were taking place, but the final decision had not been made.  The Obama administration had decided to invite Iranians to the celebrations at overseas posts as part of Obama's policy of engaging the Iranian regime.  As part of that engagement, Obama videotaped a message for the Iranian people on the Persian new year, and U.S. officials have engaged members of the Iranian government.

 Tripoli, Libya Opposition forces claimed a major victory Sunday in Libya, managing to block an onslaught by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's troops and maintain control of the key city of Misrata, an eyewitness said.  Using machine guns, sticks and anything else they could find, crowds protected the courthouse, serving as an operations center by the opposition in Misrata, and successfully repelled Gadhafi militias armed with tanks and heavy artillery, the witness said.  "The will and the determination and dedication that people are showing here on the ground, it just makes you speechless," he said.  A doctor at Central Misrata Hospital said 42 people were killed17 from the opposition and 25 from the pro-Gadhafi forcesand that 85 people were wounded in the fighting, which continued on the city's outskirts. The youngest victim, 3 years old, was killed by direct fire, the doctor said.  Witnesses and other sources are not being named for their own safety.  Humanitarian and medical aid to the central Libyan city has been blocked, U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos said in a statement Sunday. She urged authorities "to provide access without delay to allow aid workers to help save lives."  Fighting also raged in the town of Bin Jawad, where the sounds of boomseither aerial bombardments or heavy artillerycould be heard echoing. The opposition also worked to keep control of Ras Lanuf.  The battles came in stark contrast to the image Gadhafi's regime sought to portray in the capital, Tripoli. Throngs filled Green Square, cheering their support of Gadhafi, with some insisting they were celebrating the government's victory in Misrata. A government official said Gadhafi's regime was victorious in Ras Lanuf and in Zawiya, as well.  CNN was not allowed to enter Zawiya on Sunday, and could not reach people inside the city. Reports said communications had been cut off.  Libyan state TV also claimed that the government had gained control of the eastern port city of Tobruk. "Morning victory, oh people of Libya. Victory city of Tobruk from terrorist gangs," the station said.  Witnesses in Tobruk, though, said it was still under opposition control.  U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon talked Sunday morning with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kasa, appealing for an end to hostilities and discussing "the increasingly troubling humanitarian situation," according to a statement from his office. The release criticized Gadhafi's government for what it called "disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets."  After reports of the opposition successfully fighting off pro-Gadhafi forces in Misrata, Libyan state TV showed a graphicin both Arabic and Englishsaying that "strict orders have been issued to the armed forces not to enter cities taken by terrorist gangs, who took civilians as human shields and threatened to slaughter the inhabitants of those cities." The report cited "military sources," and said those cities "are being circled by the armed forces except those neighborhoods where the terrorist gangs have sought refuge."  While the pro-Gadhafi rally in Tripoli was crowded and boisterousincluding the sounds of car horns and celebratory gunfiresuch demonstrations do not offer a clear sign of how much support the 68-year-old leader actually has.  Throughout the uprising, which began February 15, witnesses in Tripoli have described the government using all sorts of methods to drum up crowds, including forcibly dragging people to them, while keeping anti-Gadhafi demonstrators off the streets.  On Sunday, police forces searched cars to try to ensure that no anti-Gadhafi protesters were out on the streets, though some still managed to venture out, a witness said.  Traces of bullets and blood could be seen in some districts near Tripoli's Green Square, and people were mopping the streets and cleaning the walls, the witness said.  On Saturday, opposition forces had claimed two major successes: preventing pro-government forces from taking Zawiya and capturing Ras Lanuf along the coast.  Opposition forces in eastern Libya briefly detained a group of British special forces. The group was let go Sunday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement.  "I can confirm that a small British diplomatic team has been in Benghazi. The team went to Libya to initiate contacts with the opposition. They experienced difficulties, which have now been satisfactorily resolved. They have now left Libya," Hague said in a statement.  "We intend, in consultation with the opposition, to send a further team to strengthen our dialogue in due course. This diplomatic effort is part of the UK's wider work on Libya, including our ongoing humanitarian support. We continue to press for Gadhafi to step down and we will work with the international community to support the legitimate ambitions of the Libyan people."  The strife engulfing the north African nation is reverberating across the country, the region and the world. Death toll estimates range from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000, and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime.  The protesters are seeking the ouster of Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of ruling the countrythe kind of revolution that was seen in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt. But unlike in those countries, the uprising has turned into warfare.  Benjamin Barber, a fellow at the New York-based Demos think tank who had worked closely with the Gadhafi Foundation, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that he felt Gadhafi, his son Saif and their supporters would likely "fight to the death"meaning a prolonged war, compared to the relatively quick and peaceful political transition that happened in Egypt and Tunisia.  Even if Gadhafi is somehow ousted, Barber predicted the violence could continue as tribes duke it out for supremacy in a nation that has few significant public institutions that could fill a potentially chaotic void.  Gadhafi's government has been reviled across the globe for violence against civilians, and the International Criminal Court has launched an investigation of Gadhafi, some of his sons and other leaders for possible crimes against humanity.  Opposition-controlled radio announced Saturday that the country's sole legitimate representative was now the National Transitional Council, a group with 31 representatives for most of the regions in Libya.  The council held its first meeting Saturday in the eastern city of Benghazi. It called Benghazi its temporary location until the "liberation" of the capital, according to a decree the council issued.  Former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdeljeleel, whom the council said had tried to resign from Gadhafi's government several times, was announced as the council's new leader.  The council also named a representative for military affairs and established a military council to oversee the "liberation" of Libya and reconstruct the armed forces, according to the radio announcement.  The council said its main missions are to represent all of Libya internationally, liberate the country, draft a constitution and hold elections.  Meanwhile, the fierce fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya, with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave.  Almost 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt, the United Nations refugee agency said.  The United States announced Saturday it is contributing $3 million to the International Organization for Migration to help return home thousands of non-Libyans who fled to Tunisia.

Ever feel overwhelmed by worries? Do you find yourself dwelling on concerns big (is my job safe?) and small (that darn clogged sink!)?  It's official: You're human and living in the United States. Anxiety levels in this country are the highest they've been in seven decades, surveys show.  Not surprisingly, money and work woes top most people's freak-out lists (thank you, lingering recession). All that e-mailing, texting, and tweeting aren't helping; social technology has reduced actual face time (a known stress reliever) and made us compulsively available to everyone at all times.  Women suffer mostwe're twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, which involves excessive worry about a wide range of things (and requires medical attention).  "Women are more likely to feel responsible for taking care of others' well-being," says Robert Leahy, director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy and author of "The Worry Cure: Seven Steps to Stop Worry from Stopping You."  And in this you-can-do-it! era, some of us think we can power through anxiety, which only exacerbates the problem.  Chronic stress has been linked to weight gain, depression, and even cancer. But this doesn't have to be your fate.  You can actually train your brain to be less anxious. Recent studies have found that both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)more about this in a minuteand mindfulness techniques can make positive changes to your gray matter, ones actually visible in a brain scan.  Health.com: 7 steps to instant calm  What is CBT, anyway?  CBT centers on the idea that we can free ourselves from a lot of angst by becoming aware of our distorted view of situations, particularly stressful ones, and adjusting our behaviors accordingly.  A 2012 review concluded that CBT can enlarge the prefrontal cortexthe part of the brain associated with weighing thoughts and making decisionsand reduce the size of the amygdala, the region associated with stress and fear.  In another study of patients with social phobia that compared the effects of CBT and the antidepressant citalopram, both treatments triggered changes in the parts of the brain that help us process, and act upon, fears.  "Our brains are constantly being shaped, most often unwittingly," says Richard Davidson, director of the Lab for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "But there are things we can do to purposefully shape them and reduce anxiety."  You can try CBT on your own with the exercises that follow, or, for a more in-depth experience, find a therapist who specializes in it.  The more you incorporate these very doable techniques into your life, the more second nature they'll become when anxious thoughts rear their ugly little heads. Try them all, then do the ones that work best daily; in about two weeks, you'll start to see a calmer, happier you.  Health.com: Which type of talk therapy is best for you?  Stay calm now, worry later  "Much of feeling anxious is that sense of urgency: 'I've got to knowis this mole cancer?'" Leahy notes. "But research shows that 85% of things people worry about actually end up having a positive or neutral outcome."  Write down exactly what's worrying you, then don't look at your note again for three or five hours. Chances are, it will feel less worrisome, and you'll be better able to consider productive actions, like scheduling a skin check at the dermatologist.  Think small  Too often, anxieties swell to epic size: I'll never get out of debt!  "Things feel more manageable when you remove worry's distortions," notes Tamar Chansky, author of "Freeing Yourself from Anxiety."  Take it step by step instead: I can't pay off all the bills now, but I can chip away at them every month.  Health.com: 9 things to stop worrying about  Give yourself a pep talk  Write down or say out loud the ways you are prepared to handle a situation: I generally get things done. I know how to ask for help. Remind yourself how capable you are.  Let George Clooney help  Imagine the issue from an outside perspective, Chansky suggests. What would your best friendor your favorite celebritysay? Conjure up that person's voice as they guide you to calm. George: Listen, woman, that CEO has a bark much bigger than his bite. You've totally got this. You: You are so right.  Use your senses  Mindfulness, an ancient practice that focuses your brain on the present, is as old as Buddha. But it's experiencing a surge of popularity; companies like Google and General Mills have mindfulness programs for employees.  Like CBT, it conditions your mind to be more stress-resistant. In a 2012 study, students trained in a mindfulness technique had a significant decrease in stress-related cortisol and an increase in signaling connections (called axons) in a part of the brain that controls emotions.  Health.com: Head-to-toe solutions for stress  "When we feel anxiety, our thoughts are rarely in the present," says Jenny C. Yip, a cognitive behavioral therapist in Los Angeles. "We are either ruminating about past mistakes or worrying about future consequences."  Zooming in on what you can see, hear, taste, smell, or feel shifts your mind to the present. The more you practice this, the better equipped you'll be when anxiety strikes, and the quicker you'll calm down. Try this four-step exercise:  1. With eyes closed, imagine yourself and your surroundings from above.  2. How does the floor, mat, or chair feel? How's the temperature in the room?  3. What are the sounds? Maybe an electrical appliance is humming, or trees outside are rustling.  4. Now tune into all these things at once.  Hard, right? That's the pointto fill your thoughts with the present. When your mind wanders (and it will), bring it back to your senses. It may just bringas famously said on "Seinfeld"serenity now.  
 The Tuskegee Airmenthe proud, pioneering group of World War II African-American fighter pilots and service personnellost two more members last week.  Clarence Huntley Jr. and Joseph Shambrey both died in Los Angeles on January 5. Their deaths were confirmed by Craig Huntly, Clarence Huntley's nephew.  The two men, who were lifelong friends and born within six weeks of one another, were 91.  "They were friends before they joined the Army," said Huntly. (The different spelling is deliberate, he said, a product of family tinkering.) "They didn't go to school together, but in the black community in Los Angeles, mostly everybody knew everybody."  There are no concise numbers for the total number of Tuskegee Airmen, the first African-American military aviators in the U.S. service corps. The group is generally said to consist of anybody who went through the "Tuskegee Experience," the Army Air Corps program established to train African-Americans for the war effort, according to Tuskegee Airmen Inc., a group devoted to the history of the Airmen.  Tuskegee's historic love story  "The Tuskegee Airmen included pilots, navigators, bombardiers, maintenance and support staff, instructors, and all the personnel who kept the planes in the air," the group's website states.  Famous Airmen include Benjamin O. Davis Jr., who became the Air Force's first black general. Their story was told in the 2012 George Lucas-produced film "Red Tails."  Ron Brewington, a historian of the Airmen, estimates that there are 200 known survivors left of the Tuskegee Experience, though the number may be higher. There are just 20 left in the Los Angeles chapter; three have died in the past three months, said Brewington.  Given that trainees went through the program from 1941 to 1949, it's a safe assumption that any survivors are in their 80s or older todayand like other World War II veterans, their numbers are dwindling. As of July, about 1 million World War II veterans were still alive, of the 16 million who served. According to the Veterans Administration (PDF), about 400 die every day.  "These guys and gals are in their 90s," observed Brad Lang, a leader of the CAF Red Tail Squadron, another organization devoted to spreading the word about the Airmen. Brewington said that one Airman he knows of is 105, the oldest known living Airman.  Clarence Huntley trained as a mechanic and was crew chief of a plane called Skipper's Darlin' III. In 2011, he had a chance to sit in the P-51 red-tailed Mustang that the CAF Red Tail Squadron takes across the country, the first time he'd sat in the cockpit of a Mustang in decades, CAF Red Tail's newsletter observed back then.  What's more, "he was wearing the same jacket he wore" in a 1944 photograph of himself in the plane, the newsletter said.  Lang recalls that Huntley had a spring in his step, hopping into the cockpit like a much younger man. Lang flew the plane in to California, where "Uncle Buddy," as Huntley was called, was one of many who visited it.  Huntly, the nephew, said his uncle was proud of his service, though "he didn't talk about it much." Just 19 when he enlisted, Huntley saw the brutal segregation of Alabamamuch different than the culture he left in Los Angelesand the bombing of an Italian airfield where he was stationed. He also saw the 1944 eruption of Mount Vesuvius, the last time that famed volcano blew.  He spent his post-military career as a skycap at Los Angeles International and Burbank airports.  Shambrey was a supervisor for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation. A call to his son, Timothy, hadn't been returned at publication time.  Their example, and that of so many others, is important to acknowledge, said Brewington, who served 22 years in the Navy.  "They made it easier for me, and I'm trying to make it easier for others," he said.  "The passing of the Airmen makes our mission all the more important to carry on so their story is not lost but continues to serve as a legacy of inspiration," said CAF Red Tail administrator LaVone Kay.

LONDON, England British television audiences will be shown an assisted suicide for the first time Wednesday, when a documentary is aired about a man taking his own life at a Swiss clinic.  Craig Ewert, along with his wife Mary, hears final instructions from Dignitas escort Arthur Bernhard before taking a fatal dose of barbiturates.  The documentary for broadcaster Sky will show the final moments in the life of 59-year-old Briton Craig Ewert, a retired university professor, as he takes a lethal dose of sedatives under medical supervision.  The father-of-two had been diagnosed with motor neurone diseasea rare condition caused by the breakdown of nerve cells in the brain that control the musclesfive months before his death at Swiss euthanasia clinic, Dignitas. He decided that he didn't want to continue suffering as a prisoner in his own body.  Ewert's story follows a number of high-profile assisted suicide cases in the UKwhere the practice is illegalin recent years, with opinion divided as to whether those involved should face prosecution. What's your view? Click here to comment  With this in mind, we answer some of the main questions related to the practice.  What is assisted suicide?  This is where the person who is going to die needs help to kill themselves and asks for it. It may be something as simple as getting drugs for the person and putting those drugs within their reach. It differs slightly from euthanasia, which involves the deliberate killing of a person for the benefit of that person.  What are the laws on assisted suicide in the UK?  Assisted suicide is currently illegal in the UK, with the 1961 Suicide Act making it an offence to "aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another." Helping somebody to die carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years.  Have people been prosecuted here for assisting suicide?  No. A decision by Britain's Crown Prosecution Service on December 10 effectively ruled out the prosecution of families who assist in such "mercy killings," when it decided no charges would be brought against the parents of a paralyzed rugby player.  Daniel James, 23, died with the aid of his parents in a Dignitas assisted suicide clinic last year after deciding he was no longer able to live with the injuries he sustained playing rugby at university.  Watch more about the case   In a landmark decision, Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said there was "sufficient evidence" to prosecute the couple, but that it would not be in the public's interest to do so. In a statement he pointed to the fact that Daniel, "as a fiercely independent young man, was not influenced by his parents to take his own life and the evidence indicates he did so despite their imploring him not to."  Has there been a push to change the law in the UK?  The issue was brought to widespread attention in 2002 when Diane Purdy, a terminally ill woman, failed in a legal bid for her husband to be allowed to help her take her life without fear of prosecution.  Her lawyers had argued that under the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to respect for private life and bans inhuman and degrading treatment, she should be allowed to die with dignity, rather than face the distressing final stages of her disease. She eventually died in a hospice in Luton, England.  Since then several attempts to legalize assisted suicide in the UK have been rejected. The most recent, in 2006, was defeated in the House of Lordsthe country's upper house in parliamentby 148 votes to 100.  In Scotland, which has its own legal system, veteran MP Margo MacDonald has launched a campaign to legalize the practice. MacDonald, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, said people should have the right to choose the time and place of their death.  She hopes to bring legislation before Scotland's parliament next year.  Why can it be done in Switzerland? Who does it?  Swiss charity Dignitas was founded in 1998 and has helped hundreds of people across Europe to commit suicide.  Dignitas takes advantage of Switzerland's liberal laws on assisted suicide which suggest that a person can be prosecuted only if they are acting out of self interest. Campaigners see the absence of a complete ban on assisted suicides as tacit permission to proceed - although their stance has never been tested in the Swiss courts.  The charity is run by lawyer Ludwig Minelli, who believes that he is helping people "die with dignity."  
 A Florida man accused of killing his parents with a hammer when he was 17 and then hosting a party pleaded no contest Wednesday to two counts of first-degree murder with a weapon.  The move by Tyler Hadley, who previously pleaded not guilty, came less than a month before he was to stand trial for the July 2011 deaths of Blake and Mary Jo Hadley.  Hadley could be sentenced, at a maximum, to life in prison without parole. A judge in Florida's St. Lucie County will hold a mitigation hearing to determine whether Hadley's youth or other factors should lead to a lesser sentence.  A prosecutor told Hadley that he intends to detail the state's entire case during that hearing, and that because of this, Hadley shouldn't think that he's sparing his family the public airing of evidence in court by pleading no contest.  St. Lucie Circuit Judge Robert Makemson then asked Hadley whether he wanted to change his mind about the plea.  "No, sir," Hadley said.  Authorities said Hadley beat his parents near and in the master bedroom of their Port St. Lucie home on July 16, 2011.  In Wednesday's plea hearing, the prosecution said evidence shows that Hadley had been using drugs and was upset about his parents' plans to put him into a "day treatment program."  After killing his parents, Hadley used "books, files, towels, anything that he could find inside the home to cover the bodies" in the bedroom, Port St. Lucie police spokesman Tom Nichols said at the time.  Before the killings, Hadley had posted on Facebook an invitation to a party at his home. Hours after the slayings, between 40 and 60 people showed up for the party, police said.  Authorities received an anonymous tip and found the bodies while conducting a welfare check at the house early the next morning.  Police said Hadley had dropped out of high school and had taken classes at Indian River State College.

Charles Smith insisted Sunday that the former NBA players who went to North Korea for a basketball diplomacy trip, led by Dennis Rodman, weren't paid by the repressive regime.  "Absolutely not. I think I am astute enough to understand the dynamics, especially collecting monetary dollars from North Korea. No, we did not get paid from North Korea at all," he told CNN in a lengthy exclusive interview on "New Day Sunday."  Smith, who retired from the NBA in 1997 after nine seasons, said an Irish online betting company and a documentary film crew paid expenses for the ex-players turned hoops ambassadors.  However, last month the Irish company, Paddy Power, said it had disassociated itself from Rodman's project after the execution of Kim's uncle and top aide, Jang Song Thaek.  Speaking by satellite from Beijing, Smith said it wasn't about the money. He saw it as an opportunity to go to a reclusive country and exchange cultural information with other athletes and citizens. But he didn't see it as a birthday present for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  "That's the date that was set. I didn't know it was his birthday," he said in the half-hour interview. "And it didn't matter to me once I found out that it was his birthday."  Smith said he felt for Rodman, who asked for his help organizing the trip and who really seemed to want to pull off a big event.  "I saw the pressure mount. I saw him change, and it was very difficult keeping him and everyone together (once controversy began over traveling to North Korea)," he said.  The trip also met with criticism because North Korea still holds Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen who was arrested in November 2012, convicted last spring by Pyonyang of "hostile acts" intended to topple the government, and sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp. Some questioned whether the players would advocate for his release, but they didn'tat least not publicly.  "We didn't go there for that. We went there to do what we normally do, and that's to be cross-cultural ambassadors and use the game of basketball as a bridge for exchange," he said.  Smith said the difference between this trip and other sports exchanges was that the players weren't sent as representatives of the United States.  "We're athletes doing it ourselves," he said.  When celebrity meets brutality  Smith said he has no regrets about going. He said he was able to meet some North Korean citizens and even came across one man who winced before shaking the hand of the first African-American he had ever met. Smith said the man told him they didn't have a very good view of African-Americans. The man rubbed his hand as if the color would come off, Smith said.  Rodman appears to bow, sings 'Happy Birthday' to North Korea's Kim  "Then the next day after we talked for a while, he came up to me and said he was sorry," Smith said.  The former NBA player, who now travels frequently as a basketball ambassador, said he didn't go to any areas where people are hungry.  Smith also swapped sports stories with North Korea's sports minister and basketball players from the national team. He thinks that will be a positive outcome from the trip.  "We accomplished a relationship on the sports side in North Korea," he said. "Where it goes from there, I do not know at this point in time. But we established a relationship. They've asked us to come back. Whether we go back or not, I'm not sure. I don't know. But there was a relationship established between a group of individuals in two different countries that don't communicate."  Rodman apologizes for North Korea outburst, says he'd been drinking  
 Nairobi, Kenya A white bus drives through Nairobi at midnight. It looks like the type tourists hire to drive out on safari but this one is stuffed with a gang dressed in black hoodies.  They target Kenya's political elite with a single message-- they are graffiti artists whose work likens their nation's political leaders to vultures.  "We tried many other animals like the hyena but the closest animal that describes a Kenyan politician is the vulture. They prey on the weak," says Boniface Mwangi, a Kenyan photographer and the group's leader.  Mwangi marshals his artists at a blank white wall next to a bank.  A graffiti artist named Uhuru focuses a tiny projector onto the murky wall as Bankslave and Smokey spray the first black outlines. They put up traffic cones to make it all look a bit more official.  Poverty tours: A learning experience or simply gawking?  But only a handful of glue-sniffing homeless wander over to look.  Mwangi is an award winning photo-journalist who has shelved his journalism career, putting his successful commercial photography business at risk.  He says the vulture art is making waves. "We have been able to change the language of the country, now politicians are being referred to as vultures by the mainstream media. And that's what we wanted that people can define the leaders for what they are."  A single moment he captured with his camera changed his life.  "There is one memorable photo," he says. "I saw a girl who had been shot and she looked like my sister. That broke my heart."  It was early 2008 and post-election unrest engulfed Kenya. Mwangi witnessed the unraveling of his country through a lens: In one image a couple stands over a dead man left on the side of the road in the rain; in another, a moment just before the impact of a machete, and then a severed hand still grasping a makeshift weapon.  His images were beamed across the globe and picked up by major newspapers. But after the awards ceremonies, the nightmares came.  "When I look back at my images, I can smell the fear and I can hear the screams. It happened in my country. Where I took the pictures, they are places that I normally go. So the images are a daily reality to my life," he says.  He adds the pain turned to anger then activism. "I was forced by circumstance. There was too much silence. The problems are there and I face them everyday. I see them everyday. But there is no one doing anything about it."  Mwangi organized photographic road shows to remind people of the horror that the political violence caused.  He says: "I believe in the power of visual art and so photography was my tool but it can only do so much. But in graffiti there is enough space to play around with images and words and pictures that don't exist."  He met up talented graffiti taggers working in Nairobi. At the time they were spraying images of Michael Jackson and Tupac. That has definitely changed.  Replacing Kenya's 'flying toilets'  On the white wall the image is coming together. It's an acerbic take on Michelangelo's "Creation of Adam."  Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Arap Moi, past Kenyan presidents, reach out to touch a gaggle of Kenya's political brass. But instead of Michelangelo's angels, they are portrayed as vultures. "Axis of Evil" is sprayed in stark red writing above the group.  Despite decades of corruption scandals implicating leaders and politically motivated flare ups, Transparency International, an NGO that works to expose corruption in government and business, says that not one senior politician has been brought to justice in Kenya.  So the artists believe they are just drawing what Kenyans are already thinking.  "It is not like nobody knows what is happening," says Uhuru, "but I think the style we are using speaks a thousand words. We just don't want to have the same violence last time."  The group has been harassed by police. And at least one senior politician has tried to buy them off, says Mwangi.  They don't favor any political group; everyone is fair game, Mwamngi says. He wants to spark a ballot revolution.  "The power is in the vote. Four years ago we tried violence, It didn't work. So the power is in the vote. We want change. It can only come through the vote. And that is why we are doing the graffiti.  "Our whole idea is when you are going to work or when you are going home you see this big mural and you can have that conversation with yourself and you can ask yourself: 'are we that stupid, why do we still vote for these people?'"

Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb army commander who went on trial Wednesday for crimes against humanity, is a notorious name synonymous with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Balkan wars of the 1990s and the bloody assaults on Sarajevo and Srebrenica.  During the five-day orgy of slaughter at Srebrenica, which Mladic is accused of being directly involved in, up to 8,000 Muslims were exterminated in what was described by the U.N. war crimes tribunal as "the triumph of evil." A judge at The Hague tribunal described what happened there in July 1995 as "truly scenes from hell written on the darkest pages of human history."  Born in Kalnovik, Bosnia-Herzegovina, during the height of World War II, the 70-year-old was a career soldier who served in Yugoslavia's military before that nation dissolved in the early 1990s.  Mladic was shaped by the war when his father was killed by Croat Nazis when he was two years old. In 1965 he graduated from a military academy and joined the Communist Party in Yugoslavia, an ethnic stew of six statesBosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Montenegro.  Over the following three decades he rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. By the time he took Bosnia's battlefields he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as defender of their dwindling fortunes..  In May 1992, Bosnia's Serbian political leaders picked him to head their forces and lead the assault on their enemies. Bosnia's Muslim leaders wanted independence while the Serbs wanted to remain part of Yugoslaviaand the ethnic majority.  Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces to besiege Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world by shelling and sniping at its poorly prepared civilian population in the valley below them. More than 10,000 people, most of them civilians, were killed.  Over the course of the three-year war that raged across the whole country more than a quarter million people died, making the conflict the bloodiest in Europe since World War II.  A French policeman who collected evidence from Bosnian Muslims, Jean-Rene Ruez, told The Hague tribunal in 1996 that Bosnian Serb forces killed and tortured refugees in Srebrenica at will. Streets were littered with corpses, he said, and rivers were red with blood. Many people committed suicide to avoid having their noses, lips and ears chopped off, he said.  Among other lurid accounts of mass murder, Ruez cited cases of adults being forced to kill their children or watching as soldiers ended the young lives.  "One soldier approached a woman in the middle of a crowd," he said. "Her child was crying. The soldier asked why the child was crying and she explained that he was hungry. The soldier made a comment like, 'He won't be hungry anymore.' He slit the child's throat in front of everybody."  As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run. Over the years, he eluded authorities while his cohort, Karadzic, was apprehended and is facing various charges at the court in The Hague. Their mentor, former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, died in jail in 2006 during his trial at The Hague.  Eventually, more than 16 years later, he was captured an hour's drive from the Serbian capital living on a farm with a cousin. World leaders and human rights groups described the arrest as "historic" and "an important step forward."  Key dates in hunt for Mladic  U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a "historic day for international justice. This arrest marks an important step in our collective fight against impunity." Interpol called Mladic "Europe's most wanted war crimes suspect" while Amnesty International's law chief Widney Brown said "at last the people who suffered have hope he will be brought to justice."  The arrest meant a major hurdle that once stood between Serbia and its long-awaited entrance into the European Union was overcome, but the trial could also usher in political backlash from the country's electorate, some of whom consider Mladic a hero.  Speaking to a Serbian Radical Party demonstration outside Belgrade's parliament building immediate after the arrest, Darko Mladic described his father as "a freedom fighter." The elder Mladic "defended his own nation, defended his people, which was his job," his son said.  Robertson: Bosnia's future is tied to justice  His family and lawyer have tried to use his poor health to prevent his extradition to the International Criminal Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia in the Netherlands, but they failed.  In the court room at The Hague last year Mladic appeared to have lost none of his visceral dislike of his enemies. CNN's Nic Robertson said he saw the defendant drawing his finger across his throat, "a gesture aimed directly at at some of the Srebrenica widows sitting in front of me, whose husbands he is accused of killing."  
 A Mario Gomez hat-trick earned Bayern Munich a 3-0 win over Kaiserslautern at the Fritz-Walter-Stadion on Saturday to send them top of the Bundesliga.  The German striker opened the scoring in the 37th minute from the penalty spot before added a second in the 55th minute.  His third came 14 minutes later with a left foot strike after some good work by Thomas Muller.  The win puts Jupp Heynckes' men ahead of Werder Bremen, who also won on Saturday, on goal difference.  Goals from Austrian striker Marko Arnautovic (38th minute) and an 83rd minute strike from Sweden's Markus Rosenberg ensured Bremen beat Hoffenheim 2-1 after Roberto Firmino had given the home side the lead in the 37th minute.  The Bundesliga's top two teams last year, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen, played out a goalless draw at the Bay Arena with both sides finishing the match with ten men.  Leverkusen's left back Michal Kadlec was shown a straight red card in the 64th minute and was soon followed by Dortmund midfielder Mario Gotze who was shown a second yellow for kicking out against Hanno Balitsch with 13 minutes remaining.  The result leaves both teams on seven points, with Dortmund in fourth place. Leverkusen are sixth.  Freiburg secured their first win of the season with a 3-0 victory against Wolfsburg.  Oliver Barth opened the scoring for the home side with a 30th-minute header, before Slovakian striker Erik Jenvresik added a second 10 minutes later.  Congolese midfielder Cedrik Makiadi sealed victory with a fine volley in the 59th minute.  Nuremberg claimed their second win of the season with a 1-0 at home to Augsburg but Hamburg continue their poor start to the season going down 4-3 at home to Cologne.  Third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach travel to Schalke on Sunday while Hanover host Mainz.  Over in Spain, La Liga kicked off with wins for Real Sociedad, Valencia and Real Betis.  Spanish striker, Imanol Agirretxe scored both goals for 10-man Real Sociedad in a 2-1 win at Sporting Gijon, while Ruben Castro scored a late winner for Real Betis as they overcame Granada 1-0.  But the game of the day was at the Estadio Mestalla as Valencia overturned a 3-1 deficit against Racing Santander to run out 4-3 winners, thanks to a hat-trick from striker Roberto Soldado.  His two late goals capped a stunning comeback for last season's third-placed team.  After giving Valencia the lead in the opening minute, Soldado then conspired to score a headed own-goal six minutes later.  Racing took full advantage of the gift with Lautaro Acosta adding a second in the 14th minute, before Adrian Gonzalez netted a third ten minutes into the second half.  French defender Adil Rami pulled one back for the home side moments later before Soldado's goals in the 88th and 90th minute ensured the new season opened in memorable fashion.

Aaron Alexis was under "the delusional belief that he was being controlled or influenced by extremely low frequency electromagnetic waves" before he embarked on a bloody shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard, an FBI official said Wednesday.  The 34-year-old contractor, who until a few years ago had served in the Navy, spelled out this beliefwith the words, "My ELF weapon"in the sawed-off Remington 870 shotgun he brought into the military facility's Building #197 on the morning of September 16.  "ELF" refers to low-frequency electromagnetic waves, a technology used for submarine communications that conspiracy theorists believe the government employs to monitor and manipulate unsuspecting citizens, the FBI said.  "Ultra low frequency attack is what I've been subject to for the last 3 months," read a message obtained by federal authorities from Alexis's thumb drives, phones and computers. "And to be perfectly honest, that is what has driven me to this."  "This" is the incident that left the Navy, Washington and the nation in shock. Alexis was quickly tabbed as the shooter. Still, big questions loomed as to why he did it, as well as whether he'd gotten help or told anyone about his plans.  Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office, stated unequivocally Wednesday "the investigation has determined that Alexis acted alone." Asked whether he talked to or e-mailed anyone ahead of the attack, Parlave responded simply: "No."  The public also got the first chance Wednesday to see Alexis in action that day, through surveillance video and photos.  They start with Alexis driving his rented blue Toyota Prius, with New York plates, around 7:53 a.m. into a parking garage, and then 15 minutes later carrying a backpack into Building #197. A still photo, taken afterward, shows that backpack hung on the inside wall of a fourth-floor bathroom stallwhere he'd put his shotgun together, authorities say.  The most chilling footage shows Alexis, dressed in a short-sleeve polo shirt and pants, prowling the building's halls and stairwells. Most of the time, his gun is cockedready to fire.  Alexis went on to kill 12 people that day and wound four others.  The same shotgun on which he had written "My ELF" contained other etchings as well. The words: "End to the torment!" "Not what y'all say!" And "Better off this way!"  At some point during his rampage, Alexis picked up a Beretta handgun. He exchanged gunfire with law enforcement officers a few times during the more than hourlong ordeal, which ended at 9:25 a.m. with Alexis shot dead on the third floor.  Alexis had arrived in the capital area on August 25 for a contracting project, a few weeks after he told police in Newport, Rhode Island, that he'd heard "voices" emanating from the walls of hotels he'd been staying at.  Once in Washington, he stayed at two suburban hotels before settling into a Residence Inn in the city on September 7.  Two days later, Alexis began his contracting job based at the Navy Yard. On the first Saturday after that, he was at a Northern Virginia shooting range and gun storewhere he purchased the Remington 870.  Flags in shooter's past apparently not red enough  FBI: Shooter did not target specific victims  A manager raised a performance-related issue with Alexis the previous Friday, but Parlave said that there is no indication this incident spurred any notable reaction. In fact, when he began shooting, it appears he wasn't picky about his victims.  "We have not determined there to be any previous relationship between Alexis and any of the victims," the FBI official said.  With his contractor statusnot to mention he was a former Navy reservistfew questioned that Alexis legitimately gained access to the Navy Yard the morning of the fateful shooting.  Still, some have asked whether he should have had such access, given his mental health and criminal history.  Tackling the military's insider threat  The latter includes a 2004 arrest in Seattle, when he was accused of shooting the tires of a man's truck in an anger-fueled "blackout," according to a police report. Alexis' father told police his son had anger management problems associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, which he suffered after working "as an active participant in rescue attempts" during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York.  Another arrest came in August 2008 in DeKalb County, Georgia, on a disorderly conduct charge. Two years later, Alexis was arrested in Fort Worth, Texasbut never charged over an allegation that he fired a gun through the ceiling of his apartment.  That was the year, 2010, that the Navy moved to discharge Alexis due to what military officials described as a "pattern of misconduct" including insubordination, disorderly conduct, unauthorized absences from work and at least one instance of drunkenness. But due to a lack of evidence, he was instead given an honorable discharge.  Then there was his mental state, including last month's incident in Newport, Rhode Island. Alexis also sought help at two Veterans Affairs hospitals in and around Washington for sleep-related issues, according to law enforcement sources.  Who were the victims?  HP drops subcontractor Alexis worked for  Despite all this, Alexis still managed to find work at The Experts for about six months over the past year. That company said the last of two background checks it conducted in June on Alexis "revealed no issues other than one minor traffic violation."  Like the military, The Experts has come under criticism for not recognizing Alexis as a potential problem or threat.  A Hewlett-Packard spokesman told CNN on Wednesday the technology companyciting its policy of adhering "to the highest standards of business practices and ethics"had dropped The Experts as a subcontractor.  "Based on what we now know about The Experts' conduct, including its failure to respond appropriately to Aaron Alexis' mental health issues and certain incidents recently reported in the press, HP has terminated its relationship with The Experts," the spokesman said.  The Experts responded, in a statement, saying it was "disappointed' by HP's decision and insisting it has met "all of our contractual obligations."  "The Experts had no greater insight into Alexis' mental health than HP, particularly given that an HP site manager closely supervised him, including during the events in Rhode Island," the company said.  1 dead in Long Island workplace shooting  FBI takes heat over video release  The FBI was criticized Wednesday night, both by Defense Department officials and victims' families following the release of the video.  "People in DoD are furious that FBI and other law enforcement officials unnecessarily put out this video footage today.  It only adds to the pain of the families and brought life back to a killer," a senior Pentagon official told CNN. "Outside of law enforcement channels, the video was not viewed."  Another Defense Department official described the release as "gratuitous," indicating there was nothing to be gained from the release.  Law enforcement officials said they reached all but one of the victims' families to inform them beforehand.  And officials at the FBI argued that the video clarified various conflicting reports about the timeline of events, and would help to dispel various pieces of misinformation, including one incorrect story that the shooter was looking for specific victims.  Ronald Hosko, assistant director of the FBI's Criminal Division, said what was released was a far less painful version of the graphic video collected by authorities.  Navy leadership said that while officials knew the footage would be released, they were not told of the content. It is not known if anyone in Pentagon leadership had expressed their views with the FBI or Justice Department.  Sources also told CNN that the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, an arm of the Navy, was part of the decision regarding the distribution of the video, and saw the footage before it was released.  One victims' family reacted with equal dismay.  "I'm in total shock after reviewing the video. We have not even had time to begin to grieve," Theodore Hisey told CNN Wednesday evening, saying his family did not know the FBI was about to release the video.  His sister-in-law, Mary Francis Knight, was one of the 12 killed by Alexis.  Navy did not know that 2004 Alexis arrest involved gun  
 Beijing Must art always serve politics?  To audiences overseas, contemporary art in China is typified by Ai Weiwei, the most trenchant critic of China's artistic and political restrictions.  But not all Chinese artists subscribe to Ai Weiwei's approach.  Ai Jing (no relation), once a popular singer-songwriter, is back in Beijing from a long hiatus, this time representing one school of China's contemporary art scene.  Her style is mostly uplifting and features politics as an afterthought, if at all.  Small wonder, perhaps, that she is the first Chinese contemporary artist to hold an exhibition in the iconic National Museum of China, next to Tiananmen Square, which is better known for revolutionary history exhibits than modern art.  Ai Jing's solo show opened just a few days after the Communist Party concluded its leadership transition in the Great Hall of the People, across the sprawling square.  "We chose Ai Jing based on our understanding of her artwork and of public expectation," said Chen Lsheng, the deputy director of the National Museum. "We believe Ai Jing's art pieces will connect China's 5,000 years history with modern art."  Chinese art-lovers know Ai Jing best as a pop singer and song-writer.  The 43-year-old Ai has cut five albums since 1992, becoming a widely popular folk and pop singer in the 1990s.  She moved to New York in 1997 and spent nearly a decade there honing her skills as an installation artist.  Her work has been featured in several New York art galleries, including the Urban Art Infill, which exhibited her piece "Sounds of New York".  Richard Vine, a New York-based art critic who has been visiting China since 2000, likes the universality of "My Mom and My Hometown," a tapestry of woolen patches knitted by Ai's mother and bedecked with the English word "LOVE".  "It expands outwardly, first for the family, community, nation and then the world. With one piece like this, she is able to touch both poles," Vine said.  Ai does not shy away from love's racier themes. One section shows square panels printed with "I love sex," and "love me, suck me."  She looks at the darker side too.  "The Tree of Life," an installation art, depicts a lonely raven perched on a leafless oak tree made of disposable chopsticks.  Her Warhol-inspired pop-art reproduces Marc Riboud's picture of "Flower Girl," which shows a woman holding a flower in front of gun-toting soldiers during an anti-war march in the United States during the 1960s.  "We hope to present the public with multiple styles of modern art to show that not all art is the same," Chen of the National Museum said. "Ai Jing may not be the most popular contemporary Chinese artist, but she is one of the most special."  Ai Jing's works are typically wholesome and uplifting, unlike many Chinese contemporary art works now popular overseas.  The paintings of Zeng Fanzhi, for example, are typically bold and edgy, sometimes darkand selling for millions of dollars in galleries and art auctions. (An art collector has called Zeng "The Jackson Pollock of the 21st century.")  Lin Tianmiao is now known for her bold surrealism, using naked body casts of herself or building a walk-in human "womb" strewn with disfigured bodies. She recently had her work featured at Asia Society in New York.  Also popular overseas are the irreverent creations of Ai Weiwei, some of which are blunt commentaries of what he sees are the dark side of life in China.  "We don't want extremist and esoteric pieces," Chen said. Ai Jing's message of love, he says, is what the Chinese public wants.  Her theme of love may seem "corny," art critic Richard Vine agreed, but "it's not something that she is just falling into thoughtlessly. It's a very considered conviction that this is after all the best response to the difficulties of life."

Little Rock, Arkansas This state launched the Clinton brand two decades ago and handed Hillary Clinton one of the biggest victories of her 2008 primary battle against Barack Obama.  But as she considers another bid for the White House in 2016, Arkansas isn't so friendly.  In the final weeks of the 2014 election, top Democrats in Arkansas told Hillary Clinton and her associates that she wasn't welcome to stump for the party's candidates in the state, according to a knowledgeable source. While there were some in Arkansas who wanted her to come, the "stay away" contingent won the argument and Hillary Clinton was left to raise money for Sen. Mark Pryor from New York.  Bill Clinton made up for the absence, making 13 stops in the state during campaign season imploring voters to not make the election a repudiation of President Barack Obama.  Still, Democrats across Arkansas lost big. The governor's mansion flipped red, along with Pryor's Senate seat. The state's four-member House delegation is solidly Republican.  The rout was part of a broader repudiation of Democrats across the South this election cycle. But the results in Arkansas were particularly tough for the Clintons and raise questions about whether the state most associated with the couple is no longer welcome territory ahead of Hillary Clinton's potential 2016 race.  "The coattails were short," outgoing Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe told CNN. "It is a fact."  Bill Clinton handily won Arkansas during both of his presidential elections. But the politics of the South changed during his time in office as many states were increasingly dominated by Republicans.  Arkansas was a genuine battleground state during the 2000 election, when Al Gore and George W. Bush both campaigned here and spent money on television ads. Seeking to distance himself from Bill Clinton after his impeachment, Gore didn't campaign with the former President and lost Arkansas to Bush by 5 points.  By 2008, Arkansas was seen as so unfriendly to Democrats that Obama wrote the state offeven as he won other southern states like North Carolina and Virginia that Republicans carried for decades.  Before the 2014 election, Hillary Clinton's supportersmany at the grassroots level in Arkansaswould quietly talk about the former first lady's chances of competing and winning Arkansas in 2016. They touted her standing with white women and working class voters.  But after Election Day, those optimistic Democrats are harder to find.  "Limited," said Vincent Insalaco, the chair of the Arkansas Democratic Party, when asked about Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the state. "It is limited here in Arkansas."  "I think she could run a strong race here, but I think the electorate has changed," said Clarke Tucker, a newly elected Democratic state representative. "The state has changed."  Hillary Clinton moved to Arkansas in 1974, joining her soon-to-be husband, Bill, who was already a rising political star in the state. The couple would go on to dominate the state's politics for the better part of two decades and left a long list of confidantsknown as FOBs or Friends of Billin key Democratic positions across the state.  But times have changed. Republican power bases in northwest Arkansas have grown, religious conservatives are a powerful voting bloc and the state's Latino population has yet to become a force at the ballot box.  "Arkansas is a real demographic nightmare for Democrats," said Andrew Dowdle, the vice chair of political science at the University of Arkansas. "It is a complete reversal of fortunes."  All of this complicates the idea that Hillary Clinton could win Arkansas in 2016. During the 2008 primary, Hillary Clinton dominated Obama, winning 70% of the state, her largest victory during that year's primary fight. That was the only time she has been on the ballot in the state, however, and was a contest with just Democratic voters.  The 2014 exit polls in Arkansas weren't positive for Hillary Clinton, either. Thirty-nine percent of voters said she would make a good president, according to the exit polls. Fifty-six percent said she would not.  Those same exit polls found that former GOP Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is also considering a 2016 run, is seen as a better presidential option in the state than Hillary Clinton. Fifty percent of voters in Arkansas said he would be a good president, compared to 46% who said he wouldn't.  With the former first lady eyeing another run at the presidency in 2016, Democrats and Arkansas experts said that while she would easily win the Democratic primary, she would struggle mightily to overcome what has become a changed state.  Democrats in Arkansas blame Obamanot the Clintonsfor their losses.  One reason Beebe, the outgoing governor, sees things getting better for Democrats in 2016 and beyond is because "Obama will be gone."  "I think it is all Obama," Beebe said. "I don't think there is any question that most folks feel like it was a repudiation of the president and the president's policies. But I think it is cyclical and the reason I say that is if you look at the history."  "Democrats are looking at what can she do different from Barack Obama," said Dowdle. "If you are a Democratic party activist, you would end up hoping she would win white women. ... That idea that a woman candidate could end up running and making the gap grow is not going to happen."  Exit polls show that Beebe is partly right: Nearly 70% of voters in Arkansas said they disapprove of Obama. Only 30% said they were satisfied with him.  For Inalasco, 2016and a Hillary Clinton run - is a moment to rebuild.  "I would hope that she would carry Arkansas," he said, rejecting the idea that Democrats are done in the state. "But if she runs it is so, so positive for us on the local level, here, for what we can do with her popularity."  As for whether the Clinton magic is gone in Arkansas, Inalasco deferred his answer for two years.  "I guess," he said, "we will see what happens in 2016, won't we?"  
 Bangkok, Thailand The Thai parliament elected the nation's first female prime minister Friday, with more than half the lawmakers backing her vote.  Yingluck Shinawatra has to be proclaimed by the nation's king before she can officially take office. If King Bhumibol Adulyadej proclaims her, she will be the 28th prime minister in Thai history.  Yingluck won 296 votes in the nearly 500-member parliament.  "The first thing I want to do is help people on their economic situation," she said last month.  Yingluck is the younger sister of one of Thailand's most polarizing political figures, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup.  He left the country two years later after being convicted on conflict of interest chargesaccusations he denies.  Yingluck's critics worry she will do her brother's biddingsomething she has denied.  "There is a lot more hard work to do in the future for the well-being of our sisters and brothers, the people of Thailand," she said last month. "There are many things to accomplish to make reconciliation possible, paving the way for a solid foundation for a flourishing nation."  Tensions between the Democratic Party and the Pheu Thai party, which reflect deep divisions within Thai society, erupted last year, leading to a military crackdown. More than 90 people were killed and hundreds were injured.  After the riots, the Thai government pledged to work toward national reconciliation to heal class and political divisions, though the divide between the two groups remains wide.

London A helicopter crashed into a construction crane atop a new luxury residential building in thick London fog Wednesday, killing the pilot and another person and sparking a line of flames as it plunged to the ground.  Thirteen others were injured in the crash that took place near a busy intersection at the height of the morning rush hour in Vauxhall, south of the River Thames in central London.  Thick smoke and flames billowed into the sky as traffic ground to a halt and emergency workers rushed to the scene, not far from landmarks like the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament.  The bent crane dangled from the building top, prompting police to cordon off roads in the area and evacuate residents and office workers. Many watched, horrified, from the street and office windows as the drama unfolded.  Watch: Crash sparks security fears  "I was standing outside having a cigarette when I saw the helicopter flying super fast towards the crane," said Rezart Islami, a builder who was working across the road from the 52-story building. "The pilot appeared not to have seen the crane because the helicopter hit it and went bang."  Islami said the rotor blade snapped off, and the copter spun to the ground and burst into flames.  "The top off the crane also came off in the impact," he said. "It all happened so fast, it was unbelievable."  Another eyewitness recounted seeing rescuers pull three injured people from two burning cars.  "It is something of a miracle that this was not many, many times worse given the time of day," said police commander Neil Basu.  Vauxhall, not far from Westminster, is where a new U.S. Embassy is being built. The area, which is a mix of industrial, business and residential use, is also home to the riverside headquarters of the UK intelligence service, MI6.  Are you there? Send your pictures and video, but stay safe  Rotormotion, a helicopter charter company, identified the pilot as Peter Barnes, 50, a married father of two.  "He was one of the most highly qualified and highly skilled helicopter pilots in the UK, and his death is a great loss for the British aviation and his colleagues at Rotormotion," spokesman Paul Blezard said. "The thoughts of all the staff are with this family and two young children at this dreadful time."  Barnes was the only person on board the helicopter, which was on a scheduled commercial flight from Surrey, southwest of London, police said.  The second person killed "was in close proximity" to the helicopter, a London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said, but gave no more details.  One of the injured was treated for a broken leg, but emergency responders said the others were not seriously hurt.  Construction workers were at the site when the crash happened but were not hurt.  James Whipps, a CNN producer, said the helicopter wreckage appeared to have landed on two cars by St. George Wharf, a major residential construction project.  Watch: Eyewitness describes the scene  The St. George Wharf construction project includes the landmark St. George Wharf Tower, also known as the Vauxhall Tower. Its developers, the Berkeley Group, say it will be one of Europe's tallest residential towers.  Whipps said he heard the sound of the helicopter rotors suddenly cut out.  He did not see the impact, but as he looked though a window, he "suddenly saw this enormous fireball, black smoke, shoot up from the side of a building."  Daniel Toledo heard "a big noise" while on his way to the nearby Vauxhall station. Though Toledo didn't see the helicopter at first, he took out his camera in time to shoot exclusive aftermath video for CNN.  "I look up, after the helicopter down," said Toledo. "Big noise again. The helicopter is gone."  Watch: Fatal copter crash stalls London commute  Nicky Morgan, a member of parliament, heard the impact from the nearby Vauxhall station.  "There was an enormous bang and clouds and clouds of thick, black smoke," she told CNN. "It was very surprising, not what you expect to see."  Despite the confusion, people remained calm, she said.  Christopher Jen was at Vauxhall Tube station on his way to his marketing job when he spotted smoke rising nearby.  "We could hear all the sirens and you could smell the smoke as the train went past the site," he said in a submission to CNN's iReport. "The station announcers did tell us that there was a helicopter crash at Vauxhall and the engineers had to go check the tracks before we could leave."  Reporters allowed through the cordons to the deadly crash scene say little can be seen other than a dark spot where the helicopter hit the ground.  A Berkeley Group spokesman said the firm was giving its full support to the emergency services after its crane was hit.  "Our thoughts at this time are with the friends and families of those killed in this tragic incident," he said.  Firefighters are now working with contractors to make the mangled crane safe.  Prime Minister David Cameron thanked the emergency services for their "rapid and professional response."  Poor visibility  Many helicopters follow the Thames as a flight route through the city. This helicopter appeared to be flying farther south than usual, Whipps said.  No cause has yet been given for the crash, but visibility was poor in London on Wednesday morning, with fog and a very low cloud ceiling.  Chris Yates, an aviation security expert, told CNN it was likely there would be questions about whether the helicopter should have been flying in these conditions.  Under safety regulations, tall buildings must have navigation lights on top to make them visible to low-flying aircraft, he said.  Helicopters are not supposed to fly within 500 feet of tall structures in central London, he said.  The London Heliport is near the crash site, on the banks of the Thames, at Battersea.  The Air Accidents Investigation Bureau, part of the UK Department for Transport, has sent a team to investigate the crash.  The Civil Aviation Authority says helicopters in London have only limited radar help and fly mostly using visual reference points on the ground.  Certain designated routes for helicopters are in place to "provide maximum safety by avoiding flying over built up areas as much as possible," it says.  Nearly 170 flights followed the central London route along the Thames in December, its figures show. About 250 flights arrived and departed from the heliport at Battersea in the same month.  Wednesday's crash caused major disruptions for many people on their way to work.  Vauxhall, with a rail station, Underground station and large bus station, is an important transit point for those traveling from the south to other parts of London.  The Nine Elms area between Vauxhall and Battersea has been earmarked as a major regeneration site, with plans to create 16,000 new homes and 25,000 new jobs.

 LONDON, England When man first walked on the moon 40 years ago, it was not only a "giant leap for mankind" but also a boon for everyday items.  A NASA-inspired tracking system is helping monitor endangered whale sharks.  Sports shoes, for example, took a huge leap forward in the late 1980s when AVIA Group International, then a subsidiary of Reebok, turned to space technology to make them more flexible and durable.  Freeze-dried food, artificial limbs, cordless vacuum cleaners and edible toothpaste were also developed using research that can be linked to NASA's forays into space.  They are listed in detail in "Spinoff," a NASA magazine first compiled in 1976 as a definitive guide to the commercialized products whose development can be tied to space technology.  "We are fairly liberal with our application of the term spinoff," said editor Daniel Lockney.  "The product has to contain a component that was developed for NASA, some aspect of it or it could just be NASA's know-how that helped the commercialization of the product," he said.  More than 1,660 articles on space-related products have been published since the magazine's first edition.  Watch some of the spin-offs developed from space technology   What you won't find on the list is the bright orange powered drink, Tang, or Teflon, or Velcroall products that have over time been erroneously linked to NASA's space mission.  "Tang was developed by General Foods before NASA was even made a federal agency, but it was popularized during astronaut tasting experiments," Lockney said.  "Velcro was invented by a Swiss engineer in the 1940s," he said, adding "Teflon was created by Dupont. It has many applications within NASA but is not a NASA technology."  Infant formula makes the grade due to an ingredient discovered during NASA research into algae as a source of food supplements.  "Different experiments led to the discovery of a nutrient substance that has previously only been found in breast milk. [This is] believed to be important in the development in the eyes and the brain."  It's now in 95 percent of infant formula sold in the U.S. and in 65 countries around the world, Lockney said.  It may have been 40 years since NASA put the first man on the moon, but the number of products that use space technology doesn't seem to be diminishing.  "Spinoff" publishes articles on 40 to 50 new space-related products every year but receives many more submissions for inclusion.  The next edition due out in October will feature a new tracking system for endangered animals, including polar bears and whale sharks, which was derived from an algorithm developed for tracking star patterns.  "Tracing theses animals is something that previously a small core group of scientists would go out and do. We're now able to have ordinary citizens upload their pictures of these animals that have been spotted through Flickr and Facebook. Logging times and dates will significantly increase the level of monitoring of these endangered species," Lockney said.  For more space-related products see NASA's "Spinoff" Web site.

The family of former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati has a message for Iran's new president: Their American son is not a spy, has never been one, and he should be released immediately from prison in Iran.  "I just askI just want the president to consider us as an Iranian family, and that my husband is sick, and me as a mother I've suffered a lot, more than two years," said Behnaz Hekmati, Amir's mother, speaking in halting English.  The family made a plea in an exclusive interview to CNN on the eve of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's first visit to the United States, where he will attend the U.N. General Assembly.  Amir Hekmati's father, Ali, is ailing with brain cancer, and the family is imploring the Iranian government to release their son before time runs out for the elder Hekmati.  "Please just let Amir come home," said Behnaz Hekmati. "Amir didn't do any crime, he didn't do anything. Just let him to come home and make his family happy again."  This month, Amir Hekmati, 30, wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry saying a confession he made to the spying charges leveled by Iran were "false" and "based solely on confessions obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions, and prolonged periods of solitary confinement."  Hekmati's family said he had gone to Iran to visit his grandmother when he was arrested in August 2011, accused by Iran's Intelligence Ministry of working as a CIA agent.  Born in Flagstaff, Arizona, then raised in Flint, Michigan, Hekmati graduated from high school and joined the U.S. Marines, where he served four years, becoming a rifleman and also serving in Iraq.  His parents came to the United States in 1979 as the Islamic revolution spread across Iran.  Two years ago Hekmati surprised his parents by telling them he wanted to visit Iran for the first time, to meet relatives he had never seenincluding his ailing grandmotherand find his roots.  "We know there is a risk involved," Behnaz Hekmati said. "We were always cautioning. And me, as a mother, because I know, I grew up in that country, I always cautioned about, you know, if something happened. But my kids, they said, 'Mom, my friend, they went, they came back, you know. And nothing's gonna happen.' And they never believe me, you know ... that it's very dangerous."  In August 2011, Amir Hekmati called his mother from Iran to say he was having the time of his life and he would be coming home soon. He told them he would leave two days after a final farewell party his Iranian relatives were having on August 29.  That party came and went; Hekmati never showed up.  For three months, no one in his family knew anything about Hekmati's whereabouts. Then one day in December 2011, Iranian state television aired Hekmati's purported confession he was a CIA spy, and announced that he was imprisoned.  The suspect was "tasked with carrying out a complex intelligence operation and infiltrating the Iranian intelligence apparatus," Iran's Press TV reported at the time.  The family described being in total shock.  "That day we saw his face. And he was confessing ... he's a CIA spy, and I said, 'Wow,' " his mother said.  Behnaz Hekmati has said all along that her son's confession was fabricated and forced by his Iranian captors, a position the U.S. State Department supports.  "They had three months to make this story," his mother said. "They knew from beginning this is a good catch, you know. ... He's a Marine."  She said she believes that's why the family was not initially allowed to talk to her son.  "That's why they didn't want us to talk to him. Because he's going to tell us the truth, what happened," Behnaz Hekmati said. "And they just come up with this story. And an attorney told us same thing. He said, 'He didn't do anything.' "  Asked why it happened to his son, Ali Hekmati offered some thought.  "Naturally, we have some speculations that someone got jealous of him and didn't like the idea that he lives in America, and they are living over there in Iran," his father said. "(That person) probably came up with some lies about him, called him a CIA spy, (because) that was his original charge."  The initial charge and detention has stretched to a two-year ordeal. Weeks after his on-air confession broadcast on Iranian television, Amir Hekmati was tried in an Iranian court and sentenced to death. Months later, Iran's Supreme Court overturned his death sentence and ordered a retrial. During his imprisonment, Hekmati spent 16 months in solitary confinement and went on a monthlong hunger strike.  The Hekmati family has tried to bring public attention to Amir's plight, hoping to secure his release. Letter after letter, plea after plea, Amir's sister Sarah has struggled to get political support to intervene.  Now that Iran has elected a more moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, in place of firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the family may have a better chance for his release.  "We just hope that we are reaching the earsespecially now with this new transition in government in Iranthe ears of the right people," Sarah Hekmati said.  The State Department has said Amir Hekmati's imprisonment follows a pattern by the Iranian regime, which it says "has a history of falsely accusing people of being spies, of eliciting forced confessions, and of holding innocent foreigners for political reason."  Hekmati is the latest in a series of Americansmost of them Iranian-Americansto face arrest in the country in recent years:   In 2007, Iran arrested several Iranian-Americans including Kian Tajbakhsh, Ali Shakeri and Haleh Esfandiari, who were all later released. (That same year retired FBI agent Robert Levinson went missing after last being seen on Iran's Kish Island. Despite photos from his captors, his whereabouts are still unknown.)   In May 2008, retired Iranian-American businessman Reza Taghavi was arrested on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group. He was released more than two years later.   In 2009, three U.S. hikers, also accused of spying, were arrested and ultimately released.   Tajbakhsh was re-arrested in July 2009 amid post-election protests and a massive government crackdown. In March 2010, he was allowed a temporary release that was later extended, according to the website freekian09.org. The Iranian-American scholar is not allowed to leave the country, the website says.   Journalist Roxana Saberi was arrested in January 2009 and convicted of espionage in a one-day trial that was closed to the public. She was freed in May that year.   Literary translator Mohammad Soleimani Nia was detained in January 2012   Christian pastor Saeed Abedini was reportedly detained in September 2012  Last week, Iran released at least a dozen other political prisoners, including one prominent human rights lawyer. Then, on Monday, the government released dozens more prisoners.  "My wishful thinking was praying and hoping that Amir's name was among that list of people that were released," his sister Sarah said. "It wasn't. But we're not going to give up."  Behnaz Hekmati made a tearful plea to Iran's new president, in English and Farsi, parent to parent, she says, to let her son come home.  "It's more than two years," she said, "Just let Amir come home. ... Amir didn't do any crime, he didn't do anything. Just let him to come home and make his family happy again."  
 Passaic, New Jersey Neighbors gathered around Eagle Liquors on Monday were sizing each other up as they waited to hear which one of them just struck it rich.  "Everyone is saying, 'Is it you? Is it you?' It's a cat and mouse game," Robert Ash said. "Everyone's coming together, smiling, trying to figure out who it is."  New Jersey lottery officials say the single winning ticket for Saturday night's $338 million Powerball jackpot came from Eagle, a nondescript brown storefront on Passaic Street. Lottery officials haven't confirmed the identity of the winner, but Pedro Quezada says he's that man.  For winner, unexpected change can come with those dollars  Quezada stopped by the store Monday afternoon, mobbed by camera crews, and store owner Sunil Sethi told CNN that Quezada presented the winning ticket earlier in the day.  Lottery spokeswoman Judith Drucker confirmed that the winning ticket was brought into the store, and the holder left with the form needed to claim the prize. But the agency won't confirm the identity of the winner until the forms are filed, Drucker said.  Sethi said his customers have been winners beforebut not with a jackpot this big.  "This was the biggest of ever," he said. "Like a dream ticket. You want to sell it as a store owner, and we did that."  At the time the ticket was bought, the winner chose the up-front cash option instead of an annuity. The lump sum will be $211 million; after federal and state taxes, the winner will net about $151 million, New Jersey Executive Director Carole Hedinger said.  The ticket matched all six numbers drawn: 17, 29, 31, 52, 53 and the Powerball, 31.  The largest jackpot in Powerball history was $587.5 million. The lottery is held in 42 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Washington.

An Australian government commission delivered a stunning blow to the sports-obsessed nation's self-image, alleging that many professional athletes are using forbidden drugs often supplied by organized crime groups.  The Australian Crime Commission said Thursday that a yearlong investigation found evidence suggesting "widespread use" of prohibited substances and illicit drugs, some of them unapproved for human use, in a number of professional sports.  "The findings are shocking, and they'll disgust Australian sports fans," Justice Minister Jason Clare said at a news conference Thursday.  Scientists, coaches and other staff have facilitated the use of the "performance and image enhancing drugs," which organized crime entities are involved in distributing, the commission said in a report detailing its disturbing conclusions over more than 40 pages.  The revelations are especially devastating for a nation where sports such as rugby, cricket and Australian football underpin identity and culture.  "An understanding of sport is central to an understanding of Australian culture and Australians' sense of who they are in the world," according to the University of Sydney. "Australia's biggest cultural events are sporting events."  A grim start to 2013 for international sports  The scandal follows a bleak few weeks for professional sports worldwide.  Last month, U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong admitted to the use of performance enhancing drugs and blood doping during his multiple Tour de France victories.  And on Monday, European police officials said they were investigating hundreds of top soccer games over suspicions of match-fixing involving international crime syndicates.  The Australian commission's report didn't specify which sports are the focus of the doping allegations, citing legal restrictions. But it said that the current official doping statistics don't reflect the scale of the problem.  Clare said evidence suggests that the drug use doesn't concern the "majority" of sports professionals, but that "we're talking about multiple athletes across a number of codes."  In some cases, sports scientists and other staff are suspected of "orchestrating the doping of entire teams," he said.  Concerns over organized crime  The role of organized crime in the trade of the illicit substances, which include peptides and hormones, has caused particular concern.  "It's cheating, but it's worse than that," Clare said. "It's cheating with the help of criminals."  Criminal groups are taking advantage of legal loopholes under which the supply of certain substances prohibited by sporting authorities isn't classed as a crime even though the athletes who use the drugs face heavy bans, the commission says.  "Professional sport in Australia is highly vulnerable to organized criminal infiltration through legitimate business relationships with sports franchises and other associations," the report said.  "There is also increasing evidence of personal relationships of concern between professional athletes and organized criminal identities and groups," it added.  These connections "may have resulted in match fixing and the fraudulent manipulation of betting markets," according to the Australian government.  'The blackest day'  The government said it was responding by giving the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority increased powers and resources to investigate the issues.  It also said that if "persons of interest" refuse to cooperate with the authority's investigations, they could face civil penalties.  "Don't underestimate how much we know," Clare said. "If you are involved in this, come forward before you get a knock at the door."  He added that as a result of the commission's report, authorities believe "multiple potential criminal offenses have been committed," and the relevant information has been passed onto police.  The catalog of problems exposed by the commission's report prompted expressions of dismay and disgust in Australia.  Richard Ings, a former head of the anti-doping authority, summed up the mood.  ''This is not a black day in Australian sport, this is the blackest day in Australian sport," he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  In an interview with CNN, Ings called the report a "wake-up call" for sports and suggested that other countries should take a look at their own sports programs to check for doping and corruption.  "What is happening here and what has been uncovered here could easily happen in any other jurisdiction and any other country around the world," he said.  Many prohibited substances in use nowadays cannot be detected by existing drug testing programs, according to Ings.  "The game has changed," he said. "It's now about investigations, it's about law enforcement, it's about exactly what happened with Lance Armstrong."  
 (TIME.com)Two of Emily Cunningham's three children have food allergies. And protecting her kids is taking toll on the family budget.  When she was nine months old, Cunningham's four-year-old daughter Elena ate a spoonful of yogurt and broke out in hives. Elena is allergic to eggs, tree nuts, dairy and peanuts, and even brief contact with one of the these hard-to-avoid items is all it takes to set off a potentially life-threatening immune reaction.  Cunningham's eight-month-old son Wyatt has a bad dairy allergy too.  In order to keep their kids safe and healthy, Emily Cunningham, a stay-at-home mother from Charlotte, North Carolina who writes the AllergenMenuMom blog, and her husband keep a completely allergy-free home, buying only food products that are free of any trace of their children's triggers.  But that protection comes at a high price. Between breathing medications and epipens of epinephrine, a drug used to treat anaphylactic shock, the Cunninghams spend about $1,000 a month to safeguard their children from their allergies, and that's before the grocery bill. Emily estimates her family spends $80 a month just on rice milk.  TIME.com: How nut allergies made me monogamous  About 4% to 6% of U.S. children under age 18 have food allergies, and the latest statistics show this percentage may be on the rise.  Why so many kids are experiencing allergies to common food items still isn't clear, although experts suspect that some of the trend can be attributed to improved public health and sanitation efforts that may have made us too clean to build strong enough immunity to common allergens found in food and the environment. Kids not eating things like nuts and shellfish at an earlier age may also contribute to the rise in food allergies.  Regardless of how the shift began, however, researchers reporting in the journal JAMA Pediatrics say that the economic cost of food allergies is also reaching a peak, with families like the Cunninghams spending an estimated $25 billion per year, or about $4,184 per child. About $4.3 billion of those costs involve direct medical fees such as medications and emergency treatments for allergic reactions, with $20.5 billion going to additional yearly costs to families.  TIME.com: Why we're going nuts over nut allergies  While other studies have investigated the economic toll of food allergies, few have studied in detail how these costs affect a family's finances.  A 2011 study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, for example, calculated that the national cost was much lower at about $500 million, but the authors acknowledged that they underestimated the prevalence of food allergies, and excluded some other costs families cover, such as higher fees for special foods and lost productivity of parents who had to sacrifice their jobs to care for their children.  TIME.com: Being born in the U.S. puts kids at higher allergy risk  For the new estimate, the researchers looked at both direct medical costs like hospital visits, co-payments and medication purchases, as well as other costs that are unique to families of children with food allergies  including special child care arrangements, allergy-friendly summer camps and even changing schools.  "I am the room mom for [Elena's] class so I can be directly involved in planning activities," says Cunningham. "I always make sure I know what is being brought in when another child has a birthday, and during special events I provide safe alternatives for my daughter, which are as similar as possible to the treats the other kids will have."  The study authors also accounted for less direct costs, such as in lost career opportunities for parents of food-allergic children, which they estimated at $14.2 billion.  Overall, they found that caring for a child with major food allergies harms a caregiver's career, primarily because many parents, who live with the specter of imminentand often emergencycare, choose to be around their children more frequently to ensure they are safe from exposure. Emily, for example, quit her job as a speech therapist to stay at home, and her husband Justin left his banking job to create apps that help families find restaurants that provide detailed information about their menu ingredients.  How can these costs be lowered?  The authors of the study say more policies that ensure safe environments for kids could provide some relief. A month ago, the Senate began considering a bill that would give states an incentive to make epinephrine more widely available.  States that allow schools to stock epinephrine are given preferential status when they apply for federal grants for asthma funding. The bill also encourages schools to allow trained staff instead of only nurses to administer epinephrine to students who may be having a reaction, and requires states to ensure that administrators have legal protections when they try to help students who might be in allergic shock.  TIME.com: Genetic glitch may explain most allergies, asthma  But will making more places "safer" cut back on costs?  In some ways, yes. But Dr. Carla Davis , pediatric allergist and immunologist at Texas Children's Hospital says families will start to see the greatest decreases in costs once better treatments are developed.  For instance, researchers are looking into oral treatments that could potentially "cure" children of their allergies by building their tolerance with repeated exposures to tiny amounts of the allergen. Doctors are encouraged by early results that suggest such de-sensitization can lessen the chances that allergic children will experience anaphylactic shock if they are exposed.  More options for treating immediate reactions can also lower costs of devices like epinephrine devices; when the new epinephrine auto-injector, Auvi-Q,which is slimmer and more portable that previous models, was launched last year, more coupons and discounts were available for epi pens overall.  TIME.com: Bullying over food allergies  "A little competition has made a big difference for a lot of families," says Cunningham. "The number of people dealing with foods allergies is promoting more products to become available, which should help with affordability and availability of options."  This article was originally published on TIME.com

London Rupert Murdoch can be expected to be personally furious and potentially devastated by the partisan-but-damning judgment of a committee of British lawmakers that he is not a "fit" person to run an international business.  This choice of wording is powerful for two reasons: One immediately damaging to News Corporation and its ambitions to take full control of the prize asset of British Sky Broadcasting, and the second personally damaging for the 81-year-old Murdoch.  To hold a broadcasting license in Britain the corporation controlling the television station must itself pass a test that its executives are "fit and proper." Within minutes of the parliamentary Culture Media and Sport Committee publishing its judgment about Rupert Murdoch's behavior and deeper condemnation of the culture at News Corporation the British regulator of television and broadcasting, Ofcom, reiterated in response to a query that it is investigating his status as a leading shareholder in BSkyB.  The committee's wordsmade publicly and with the protection of parliamentary privilege from legal action by Murdoch or News Corpalso take Murdoch back decades to one of the greatest rivalries of his career with the late Czech-born publishing magnate Robert Maxwell. Critics often compared Maxwell and Murdoch in the same sentence, something Murdoch is known to hate since he saw Maxwell while alive as a charlatan. Maxwell's death led to even greater revelations that he was also at the head of a conspiracy to defraud staff pension-funds controlled by his companies.  No one has suggested Murdoch is guilty of financial misconduct in the current controversy which has spanned illegal telephone hacking, alleged corruption of police and civil servants and undue influence over politicians.  Murdoch, who values his personal reputation for probity as much as he honors the memory of his father Keith as a campaigning journalist and newspaper proprietor, will not miss the similarity of the language used by the select committee in Tuesday's judgment and that used by then Board of Trade's damning judgment in 1971 that Maxwell was "unfit" to run a public company. That judgment hung heavily on Maxwell's reputation for the rest of his life.  Of course, Maxwell did go on to run a major public company, which after his mysterious death at sea off his luxury yacht in November 1991 was found to have taken more than 400 million ($648 million) from staff pension funds in attempts to prop up its failing businesses.  Those who forced the tough language through into the committee report will have been in no doubt that the comparison with Maxwell would be made by those with long memoriesno more so the trade unionists Murdoch stomped on and the right-wing establishment he disdainedand how much it would sting Murdoch.  Labour and Liberal Democrat members of the select committee forced the "not fit" judgment through the minority of their Conservative committee colleagues though the other stinging criticisms of News Corporation were unanimous including that it had been misled by News Corp executives. The report has no legal force but comes with the stamp of parliamentary authority and follows many months of investigation and open hearings, including with Rupert and his son James.  Based on two major biographies, it is clear that Murdoch is known to loathe any parallel between himself and Maxwell. The words of the select committee will bring that into sharp relief, providing ammunition to a section of the British establishment which has never liked the Australian publisher and seen him as polluting their vision of British life. For his part, Murdoch has historically relished taking on the effete of Britain, variously accusing them of wanting to turn the country into a museum and recently portraying the crisis swirling around him as the work of "enemies many different agendas, but worst old toffs and right-wingers who still want last century's status quo with their monopolies."  Despite now perhaps actually being the establishment, Murdoch still sees himself as the "Aussie battler" against entrenched interest groups, particularly in the highly class-based British establishment. He is likely to see the damning select committee reportwith its strong language forced through by trade-union-backed Labour politicians with a visceral dislike of his power and wealthin the same terms but the comparison with a crook like Maxwell will infuriate and hurt him.  And this report is only the latest wave in an ongoing tsunami of bad news. News Corp and Murdoch still have to face months of further revelations about telephone hacking at the News of the World, over-close relationships with police and civil servants and his empire and the embarrassing exposure of just how close relationships were between News and politicians of all major parties in Britain.  
 Los Angeles The lawyer who represented Lindsay Lohan in her lying-to-cops case last week is under investigation for suspicion of witness tampering, a source close to the investigation said Monday.  Santa Monica police are investigating New York lawyer Mark Heller on suspicion of asking Lohan's personal assistant, who was in the car with the actress when she was involved in a car crash last June, to lie in his testimony by saying he had control of the Porsche when it crashed into a dump truck, the source said.  The Santa Monica city attorney asked the city's police to investigate, according to the source, who asked not to be identified since the source is not authorized to discuss it with news media.  Photos: Celebrity mugshots  "I can sum it up in one word: ridiculous," Heller said when asked for a comment. "What can I tell you?"  Heller was in a Los Angeles courtroom with Lohan, 26, last week when she agreed to enter a no-contest plea on the charges of misdemeanor charges of lying to police, reckless driving and violating her probation for shoplifting conviction.  The judge sentenced Lohan to 90 days in a "locked in" drug rehab facility in lieu of a 90-day jail term. Her probation was also extended by two years.  Her father, Michael Lohan, accused Heller of unethical and criminal conduct in his representation of his daughter after last week's hearing, saying prosecutors were investigating Heller for tampering with "a star witness."  Lindsay Lohan: Keep me on set, it's safer that way  Lohan hired Heller to replace Shawn Holley, the Los Angeles lawyer who represented the actress in dozens of court appearances over the past several years.  She's spent 250 days in five rehab facilities since January 2007, including one long court-ordered stint after a failed drug test.  The actress has appeared in court at least 21 times before four Los Angeles judges who have now found her in violation of probation six times and sentenced her to a total of nine months in jail.  Lohan has spent about two weeks behind bars in six trips to the Los Angeles County jail, served 35 days under house arrest and worked about 67 days of community service at the county morgue.

On 9 March 2010 I stood outside the international bus terminal on Erdbergstrae in Vienna, waiting for the 11 a.m. bus from Zagreb to arrive. It was cold and breezy, typical of March in the Austrian capital.  A steady stream of tourists emerged from the buses and headed to see the palaces of the Habsburgs.  Jed had told me there would be a CIA team shadowing me. I looked at a man in a cowboy hat on the street corner checking his watch.  Surely they would not be that obvious.  Then I saw her. She wore a long black skirt as I had anticipated, but instead of being fully veiled, she was wearing a simple headscarf. A few stray strands of blonde hair fluttered in the breeze.  'As salaam aleikum. I'm Aminah,' she said in soft-accented English, fixing me with her blue-green eyes.  Despite the fact that Awlaki had instructed me to wear Western clothes to avoid suspicion, I had to keep my distance from a woman who was not related to me. I didn't even shake her hand. But I was impressed; the photos had not done her justice. Aminah was strikingly pretty, with full lips, high cheekbones and an angular nose. She looked several years younger than her age, thirty-two. Gwyneth Paltrow, I thoughtAnwar will love this girl.  I had come across her on a Facebook fan page for Awlaki in November 2009two months after he had repeated his request that I find him a wife in the West. I had left a message on the site requesting support and Aminah had replied.  'What kind of support and are you in direct contact with Shaikh?' she wrote in her first message on 28 November 2009.  Two days later, after we exchanged several messages, she wrote this:  'I have one question tho. Do you know personally AAA? And if it is so, may I be so liberal to ask you something?  AAA was our code for Anwar al-Awlaki.  'Yes I do know him. Feel free to ask,' I replied immediately. She had written back:  'I sent Shaikh a letter by mail, I am not sure if I had his correct email address, but actually I was wondering will he search for a second wife, I proposed him a marriage, and I do not know how silly it is. But I tried.  Now, as I am in contact with you there is a possibility for you to get know me better in a way you can recommended me.  'I seek a way how to get out of this country, and I search a husband who will teach me and whom I can help a lot. I deeply respect him and the all things he do for this Ummah and I want to help him in any way.'  I wrote back:  'You will be wife number 3, as he already got two wives, however he don't stay with them because they are in the capital, and only see him now and then. But you will stay with him all the time, as you don't have a family there. You should expect hardship, and moving from place to place once in a while. Taking care of your duties in house as a wife. Be patience with all what you will see and face, as AAA may be expose to danger etc. and Allah is our protector. Can you accept this?'  She replied within ten minutes:  'I would go with him anywhere, I am 32 years old and I am ready for dangerous things, I am not afraid of death or to die in the sake of Allah. I didn't know he has 2 wife already. But I do not mind at all. I want to help him in his work ... I am good in housekeeping job [and] I'm willing to be a very hardworking and active wife.'

 LOS ANGELES, California  Howard K. Stern and two doctors entered "not guilty" pleas to charges of conspiring to provide drugs to Anna Nicole Smith before her fatal overdose in 2007.  Howard K. Stern,  Anna Nicole Smith's longtime confidant, arrives at Los Angeles Criminal Courts on Wednesday.  SternSmith's longtime partner and attorneyappeared before a Los Angeles judge Wednesday morning for formal arraignment, along with co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor.  The three are charged in California with several felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007only weeks before Smith's death.  California Attorney General Jerry Brown, when he announced the case in March, said the doctors and Stern devised a plan to use fake names so Smith could be prescribed "thousands of pills."  Smith, the former Playboy playmate and reality TV star, was drugged "almost to the point of stupefaction," Brown said.  Stern defense lawyer Steve Sadow has called the charges baseless and accused Brown of using Smith's death for his own political purposes.  "Bottom line is that Howard K. Stern did not commit a criminal act, period, and you can ask me that all day long and I'll still tell you he did not commit a criminal act," Sadow said after Wednesday's hearing.  Smith, 39, was pronounced dead February 8, 2007, after being discovered unconscious in her hotel room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino near Hollywood, Florida. A coroner said she died from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs.  Florida prosecutors said in March they were taking a new look at Smith's death to see if evidence California investigators had gathered recently might cause them to open an inquiry.  The Broward County, Florida, state attorney's office never opened a probe into Smith's death but did assist the Seminole police department in its investigation in the days afterward.

Interim Honduran President Roberto Micheletti installed himself as leader of a new unity government late Thursday, a move that drew condemnation from ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya.  Making a late night public announcement, Micheletti said his entire cabinet had resigned to clear the way for a reconciliation cabinet to be named.  "This cabinet is a result of an ample participation of different sectors of civil society as well as the political parties," he said. "Tonight with this new government, we're answering the call for the unity of all people of Honduras."  He did not identify any of the new cabinet members.  Representatives for Micheletti and Zelaya signed an agreement October 30 to form a reconciliation government that would rule until a new president, to be chosen in a November 29 election, takes office in January. The deal included the possibility of Zelaya's reinstatement to the presidency, but contained no guarantee.  The pact called for the unity government to be named by Thursday. The agreement also stipulated that the nation's congress, in consultation with the supreme court and other institutions, would vote on whether Zelaya would be returned to power.  That vote did not occur Thursday.  Zelaya told local media that Micheletti's actions violated the accord, which he called "a dead letter." The reconciliation government, he said, must be led by the democratically elected president of Honduras.  "How can a person who has not been elected by anyone lead a government?" he said.  Zelaya was flown out of the country by the country's military June 28 but secretly returned to Honduras on September 21, obtaining refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.  Micheletti sent Zelaya a letter earlier this week asking him for the names of people the deposed president would like to have in the unity government. Zelaya did not answer the letter.  Micheletti said Zelaya's refusal to answer gave the interim president the right to name all the members of a new government.  "With this agreement, we have made an important step to strengthen our democracy," Micheletti said. "Despite the fact that Mister Zelaya did not send any of his representatives ... we're still looking for an opportunity for these citizens of Honduras to be integrated in the government of reconciliation."  The Organization of American States, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated. The United States and others imposed economic sanctions, which some analysts say have started to hurt Honduras.  Many nations, including the United States, also said they would not recognize the winner of this month's presidential election if the vote is held under Micheletti's rule.  The United States seemed to shift that position after last week's accord.  Thomas Shannon, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, told CNN en Espaol this week that the United States would recognize the winner of this month's presidential election even if Zelaya is not returned to power beforehand. Shannon played a key role in obtaining last week's agreement.  The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya's desire to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution to allow longer terms for the president.  The country's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal.  Micheletti and his supporters say Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup.  
 A judge, who was suspended after an online video showing him beating his teenage daughter went viral, was reinstated by the Texas Supreme Court.  Judge William Adams was back working Wednesday at Aransas County after his suspension was lifted by the state's high court, a court clerk said.  The state's Commission on Judicial Conduct earlier ruled that Adams would receive a public warning for the incident, which cleared the way for the suspension to be lifted.  The move to allow the judge back on the bench angered Adams' former wife and daughter.  "My first feeling is extreme sadness," said Hallie Adams, the former wife. "I feel sad for the public. I see the justice system is failing and justice review system is failing."  Hillary Adams, the judge's daughter, was also upset.  "I'm embarrassed to live in Texas," said the girl who was the buzz on the Internet last year after releasing the beating video.  Adams was suspended last year after the 2004 video went public. It showed him beating his then-16-year-old daughter because she downloaded online music and games.  The beating occurred when her father was punishing her for using the Internet "to acquire music and games that were unavailable for legal purchase at the time," Hillary Adams, wrote on the Internet posting. She said she released the video after being harassed by her father.  "It was the straw that broke the camel's back," she said last November. "It wasn't any huge happening or anything."  She said she told her father she had the video, "and he didn't seem to think anything of it, and basically dared me to post it."  The video posting said, "Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgment as a parent himself. Do not allow this man to ever be re-elected again. His 'judgment' is a giant farce. Signed, Hillary Adams, his daughter."  The 7 1/2-minute video is punctuated by cracks of the man's belt and the girl's screams and cries.  At one point, the man says to his near-hysterical daughter, "What happened to you, Hillary? Once you were an obedient, nice little girl. Now you lie, cheat and steal."  At another point, he yells at her, "You want to put some more computer games on? You want some more?"  William Adams has acknowledged that the man in the video was him.  As a judge, William Adams handles misdemeanor cases, including family-related and juvenile court issues.

"The Searchers" may be the greatest movie Western, and that reputation has only grown since its 1956 premiere.  It boasted three major reasons for its stellar reputation: actor John Wayne, director John Ford and the spectacular location shooting in Monument Valley, Arizona.  But perhaps the key ingredient to its success lies in the foundation of all creative endeavors: the story. "The Searchers" is a mix of truth and legend, obsession and violenceplayed out on the rim of a growing nation.  A young white girl is abducted by warring Indians and assimilated into the tribe, while a vengeful uncle launches a years-long quest to find her. Modern directors like Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have sung the film's praises and borrowed its themes of racial hatred, obsession and redemption.  For the first time, this movieand the true story of the girl, Cynthia Ann Parkeris fully chronicled, in Glenn Frankel's new book "The Searchers: The Making of an American Legend" (Bloomsbury USA). The author, a former Washington Post foreign correspondent and now director of the University of Texas at Austin's journalism school, brings a reporter's sparkling eye for nuanced detail and context to explore the film's creation.  It is a winning account filled with larger-than-life characters: women and men who share the power to endure through personal and creative trial.  CNN spoke with Frankel recently about his New York Times best-seller.  CNN: This is a chronicle of myths and truths meshed together. Was your goal in writing this book to divide them?  Glenn Frankel: As a journalist, we're always trying to separate fact from fiction as best we can, but the farther back in time we go, the more dangerous an exercise that is. I never pretended that I was going to be able to provide a definitive version of the kidnapping of Cynthia Anne Parker in 1836 by Comanches. It was more that I was going to put things into the right perspective. When I started out, I hadn't planned on doing any of that. I was just going to do a making-of-the-movie book. But I quickly found that there was a story that it was loosely based on and that there were all these layers. Once I went there, there was no escape.  CNN: The Western is seen as essential to understanding the American identity.  Frankel: Novelist and screenwriter Alan LeMay takes that true story and changes the focus in the movie from the kidnapped little girl to the people who were searching for her over the years. (Director) John Ford put a real emphasis on the uncle who searches for her, because he asked John Wayne to play the character. So they deepened and darkened that character. And they go on to make a movie that is really about the impact of the kidnapping and of the violence of the Comanche/Texas wars-- the impact on the pioneer families.  By the early 1950s, the Western had become a deeply embedded film genre. It has its own mythsthe themes of the lone gunman, the laconic guy on horseback, the Indian fighter. And John Ford was the ultimate Western myth-maker. Ford gives us both John Wayne in all his charismatic glory and at the same time, undermining this myth all through this movie. He gives us the great hero, and yet the great hero is on this quest that is very dangerous and one that becomes almost homicidal.  CNN: Cynthia Ann Parker's story of survival was incrediblewas she a victim of competing cultures?  Frankel: Texas history has different ways of thinking about her. She's the Comanche white princess and in a sense they've glorified her, especially in recent history, as this tough Texas woman who is a survivor and comes through the ordeal in high spirits. Painting her as the ultimate victim has its problems, too, because victims aren't very interesting, are they? Cynthia Ann was a victim of the war because she was damaged and traumatized by both sides. First, these Comanches and Kiowa come along in 1836, they murder her father and grandfather in front of her, they haul her off with four other young people. She doesn't know if they're going to kill her, they speak a foreign language. She spends 24 years as a Comanche and then a second traumatic event.  This time Texas Rangers and U.S. Cavalry descend on the little camp she's in. They kill the people around her, they haul her off again. She never sees her Comanche husband or her two Comanche sons again. So really she's wrenched, and both sides feel they have a right to do this, they feel that she should be grateful for this in some way. I see her as a symbol of the damage and the violence of this protracted Comanche/Texan war. She left no narrative. When it became clear to her family that she was miserable, she became an embarrassment to them, and they packed her off to a sawmill in East Texas. This onetime celebrity died in obscurity.  CNN: The movie was ignored at first to a large extent, then later fully appreciated. What changed?  Frankel: It initially got pretty good reviews, but nobody was digging into the layers of this movie, especially with racism and gender. It was before its time. It starts emerging, I'd say, in the 1970s. Scorsese and Spielberg-- it was very formative for them. They quoted from it in many of their own films. It's an enduring filmit's a beautiful piece of visual storytelling. Yet it's so ambiguous, and it's about such important themes, not just racism and sexism, but also about this conflict between love and hate that's going on in the movie.  CNN: You write that what entranced you most were the Comanches.  Frankel: They're such a fascinating group. They were up on the limestone plains, it was a real hard life. They were great horsemen, developed an empire, they were raiders and traders. And there were never that many of them, the tribes started kidnapping basically to replenish their population. They treated their enemies with great cruelty at times and yet they treated each other with great love and dignity. Parker's (Indian and white) families are still around, they have annual separate family reunions.  CNN: Tell us about John Ford.  Frankel: Ford was a tough guy. He was a lifelong alcoholic, but he was a great filmmaker. He managed to get this loyal band of actors and craftsmen around him, people who worked for him time and time again. He could be very abusive to them. At the same time, they would bleed for him. They knew that Ford was special and that the kind of films he was making were enduring. Wayne knew he would be stretched here as an actor.  CNN: This is John Wayne's movie.  Frankel: I think it's his greatest role. A lot of us have a problem with John Wayne. We have this vision of him as this guy in the 1960s and 1970s who was very right-wing, very pro-Vietnam War, a caricature. But before he was that guy, he was this very supple and interesting character. On the one hand, he's John Waynehe's very charismatic and we're rooting for him to succeed on his quest and yet, what is the quest? Our white knight is planning to kill the young damsel. He's very burdened by this mission, but he's driven by vengeance and his brand of justice.  CNN: It's a pretty amazing cast of characters.  Frankel: In many ways, they're all storytellers, they're all trying to explain themselves through stories and trying to find a safe place in the world. For Cynthia and her Comanche son Quanah, it's trying to survive. For LeMay and Ford, it's about turning this into art. I took great joy in studying these storytellers. It's a great American story they're telling and it's one that's still being told by the families.  
 Confusion reigns in Egypt after stunning court rulings threw the country's awkward transition toward democratic rule into turmoil.  The decision sparked cries that Egypt's military leaders have engineered a "soft coup" to thwart their longtime foesIslamists who just four months ago captured a majority of seats in the Egyptian parliament in the first election in Egypt in generations. The court's decision dissolves parliament, and the military was quick to say it now controls legislative affairs in Egypt, actions that raised the prospect of renewed mass street protests.  The dizzying developments sent shock waves across Egypt just 16 months after a popular uprising toppled former President Hosni Mubarak and two days before Egyptians go to the polls to elect a new president. They also raised fresh questions among many about whether the militarylong the most powerful force in Egyptian lifewould ever yield power.  "Egypt is entering into a very dangerous stage, and I think a lot of people were caught by surprise," said Shadi Hamid, director of research at the Brookings Doha Center. "We knew it was getting bad, but we didn't think it was getting this bad."  He called the court rulings the "worst possible outcome" for Egypt and said the transition to civilian rule was "effectively over."  In one ruling Thursday, the Supreme Constitutional Court found that the rules governing January's parliamentary elections were invalid, triggering the dissolution of parliament.  In the second, the court rejected a law barring former regime members from running for president, clearing the way for Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister under former Mubarak, to run in this weekend's runoff election. He faces Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist candidate favored by many in the Muslim Brotherhood and their allies and supporters.  The military leadership, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, also announced it would name a 100-strong panel by Friday that will draw up a new constitution for the country.  The moves came only hours after a decree was issued giving the military extended powers of arrest over civilians.  That decree ushered in de facto martial law, observers said, just two weeks after many Egyptians celebrated the demise of a decades-old emergency law that gave authorities broad leeway to arrest citizens and hold them indefinitely without charge.  Eric Trager, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, characterized the situation as a "soft coup in Egypt."  What is the Muslim Brotherhood?  The military leadership's action "really signals it's moving very sharply against the political process," Trager said. Its actions are also piling on the pressure on the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group whose political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, is headed by Morsi, he said.  "The question is whether that's going to lead the Muslim Brotherhood to up its own confrontation with the military or whether the Brotherhood will use it as an opportunity to seek some kind of accord with the military," he said.  Right now, the military and the Muslim Brotherhood have ongoing conversations, but it is not yet clear what they may produce, Trager said.  The Brotherhood could seek a deal where Morsi is made prime minister if Shafik wins the presidency, he said.  But if the Muslim Brotherhood commits itself to confrontation in the form of street proteststhereby threatening a second revolutionthat could be a game-changing situation, Trager said.  Experts are watching to see whether the decision reignites the huge street demonstrations that drove Mubarak from power in February 2011.  It's not yet clear whether ordinary Egyptians, many of whom are exhausted by the long months of uncertainty, will consider the ruling an attempt by the ruling elite to snuff out the promise of democracy fought for in Tahrir Square.  The real obstacle to democracy in Egypt  Analysts say the Supreme Constitutional Court is considered partial to the regime headed by Mubarak, in which the military played a pivotal roleand its perceived failure to maintain judicial independence could spark renewed anger.  "Essentially, no, the court is not neutral," said Steven Cook, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "It is very much part of the old regime. I think you are going to see people pouring into the streets and demand change."  One young Cairo woman outside the court expressed the frustration felt by many protesters. "SCAF has been suppressing our protests, suppressing the youth movements on the ground, they have been arresting thousands of us," she said, referring to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces.  But Amre Moussa, who was a foreign minister under Mubarak, was chief of the Arab League, and most recently a presidential candidate, played down the impact of the ruling on parliament.  "It is not a political move or a decision by the SCAF, it is a legal matter that has been referred to the tribunal, by individuals, by other parties," he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.  As for the wrangling over who will write the new constitution, Moussa said it is not of crucial importance.  "The current constitutional declaration is enough to give the president the powers he needs," he said. "I believe that the president, once elected, knows exactly the powers he will use."  Photos: A look back at Egypt's uprisings  Following the court decision, Egypt's interim military rulers declared full legislative authority, creating anxiety and uncertainty about the country's future.  It was just on January 23two days before the anniversary of the birth of a revolution that eventually toppled Mubarakwhen the military surrendered legislative powers to the first parliament in the country's history to be dominated by Islamists, whose two parties won about 70% of the seats in the lower house.  The military is considered by many to be a bulwark against the power and influence of Islamists in Egypt.  And some who fear the Muslim Brotherhood has gained too much strength may welcome this knock to the confidence built from its successes in the parliamentary vote.  "With parliamentary elections, there was this sense that the Brotherhood could now go for broke," Cook said. "They seem to have been outmaneuvered by the military and courts and associated supporters of the old regime. It may be time to make a deal to preserve themselves to fight longer."  All eyes will be on the conduct and outcome of the runoff this weekend.  Taken together, the military leadership's actions indicate "there's a high likelihood of Shafik being aided to victory by the military," Trager said.  But Khaled Fahmy, a professor at American University in Cairo, told Amanpour that people are "very confused" and split over who to back.  "Ahmed Shafik made a very powerful speech today, he tried to calm many people," he said. "But there is a lot of sympathy I think now for the Muslim Brotherhoodthere's a lot of fear of what Shafik is capable of doing.  "And because things now have become so clear and the gloves are off, people see what the military is intent on doing. Yesterday's ruling by the minister of justice giving the military police these excessive rights, this is a serious militarization of Egyptian society, that we made the revolution against."  Fahmy said he believes blunders by the Muslim Brotherhood are partly to blame for its current weakened position.  The Brotherhood has failed to get results in parliament, where its lawmakers have been "cocky" toward liberal forces, he said, and also failed to realize just how deep the military's influence runs through Egypt's intelligence and security servicesthe so-called deep state.  The "legal coup" pulled off by the military is just the latest front in a long-running battle for dominance between the two sides, he said.  "This has been in the offing for not only months, but for years and years," Fahmy said.  "The events of today and indeed the past few weeks have shown very clearly the determination by SCAF to oust the Muslim Brotherhood altogether, and to deny it serious victories that it had won legitimately through by ballot boxesand today is the culmination of that struggle."

A high-speed passenger train left its tracks on the outskirts of Split, Croatia, Friday, killing at least six people and injuring 45, according to Croatian police.  The high-speed train derailed on the outskirts of Split, Croatia, about noon on Friday.  The train was on its way from the Croatian capital, Zagreb, when it derailed about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from it's destination of Split about noon, said Marina Kraljevic-Gudelj, a spokeswoman for police in Split.  "This is a huge tragedy, so there is no place for speculation," she said.  Police had launched an investigation into the cause of the crash.  CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.  
 On Thursday, a major tech company stepped into the middle of a vicious two-month-long battle among video game fans, scholars, developers and journalists over the representation of women in games.  Intel has pulled an ad campaign from popular video game news site Gamasutra. The move is in response to a online protest by a group of gamers upset with a column by the site's editor-at-large, Leigh Alexander.  A veteran games journalist, Alexander is one of many writers who have recently been critical of parts of the gamer culture and the male-centric "gamer" identity.  Gamasutra confirmed the action on Twitter, saying "Yes, our partners at @intel were flooded with complaints over a recent opinion piece, and they did pull an ad campaign."  The tension began in August when critic and academic Anita Sarkeesian released the latest episode in her YouTube show on female tropes in video games. Around the same time, a game designer named Zoe Quinn was attacked online by an ex-boyfriend who claimed she cheated on him with a games journalist.  Both women found themselves at the receiving end of graphic threats of violence from defensive gamers and Internet trolls. Sarkeesian contacted the police and had to temporarily leave her home.  The backlash against the two soon spread to journalists and others who were critical of the gaming status quo and the way women are treated in the medium.  On the other end are gamers who feel their subculture is being threatened. Some game players worry that activists will cause game makers to change their product to please a wider audience. They started rallying under the #Gamergate hashtag.  Supporters of the Gamergate movement, who are well organized and driven, say they are actually combating corrupt games journalism. In the case of Alexander, they say her columns were "offensive" and "racist." The emails to Intel were part of a larger campaign against sites that have published content they find offensive, including Kotaku and Polygon.  After confirming that Intel had indeed pulled the ads, a company spokesperson told Re/Code on Wednesday, "We take feedback from our customers very seriously especially as it relates to contextually relevant content and placements." Intel declined to comment further to CNN.

A New York jury Wednesday found former pharmaceuticals executive Gigi Jordan guilty of first-degree manslaughter for feeding a lethal drug concoction to her autistic 8-year-old son.  The jury accepted her claim that she acted in a state of "extreme emotional disturbance." Jordan faces a 5- to 25-year prison sentence.  "Gigi Jordan showed no mercy to her son, and should receive none at the time of her sentencing," Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement.  Jordan, 53, displayed little emotion as the verdict was announced at the close of a sensational two-month trial in Manhattan, in which prosecutors described in chilling detail how the businesswoman, who made a fortune in pharmaceuticals, forced little Jude Mirra to swallow a cocktail of painkillers and anti-inflammatories in 2010. Prosecutors said Jordan, who testified that she killed the boy to prevent him from being sexually abused, forced many of the drugs down his throat with a syringe.  Jordan's defense lawyers, citing legal errors during the long proceedings, said they will appeal and seek a new trial.  "This was not a murder case," defense attorney Norman Siegel said outside court. "And that's because there were extenuating and horrific circumstances. And, apparently the jurors got it."  Defense lawyer Allan Brenner said the verdict was a victory.  "She loved him so much that she couldn't bear the thought of him living without her, or him being subjected to the life she tried to rescue him from," he said. "Any time someone is convicted of a crime, particularly of the crime of having caused the death of a young child, there's nothing to revel in. There's no glory or triumph here. To the extent that the jury has said this was not a mother viciously, violently, coldly doing away with her child, that's a triumph."  Defense: She was a desperate mother  At her trial, which started on September 10, no one disputed the unthinkable manner in which Jude spent his final hours on February 5, 2010. Police found his cold body after they were dispatched to the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan. The call to police came after a relative of Jordan's was unable to reach her.  When police arrived at the hotel, they found Jordan sitting next to the bed where her son lay unresponsive, surrounded by pills and pill bottles.  An autopsy found four of the painkillers and anti-inflammatories used to kill the boy still undigested in his stomach. Orange juice and vodka were used to wash down the drugs.  Prosecutor Matt Bogdanos presented expert testimony that showed the boy's injuries were consistent with Jordan climbing on top of Jude and holding open his mouth as she poured the lethal cocktail.  But Brenner painted a portrait of Jordan as a desperate mother ultimately driven to kill Jude by her two former husbands. The defense said one ex-husband had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left Jude with her other former husbandhis biological fatherwho she believed had sexually abused the boy.  "This was not an act carried out with murderous intent," Brenner told jurors in closing arguments.  The prosecution said there was no evidence Jude was ever sexually abused.  On the stand, Jordan, a former nurse who started a home health care company, portrayed her actions as a mercy killing. Her ex-husband was threatening to kill her, she said.  "You're a dead woman," she claimed he told her.  "I made the decision I was going to end my life and Jude's life," she told the jury, placing her hand over her mouth.  Jordan said the boy was physically and sexually abused not only by his biological father but also by others, including the woman who took Jude to school. She testified that the boy was assaulted by "a good number of people."  The boy's father has denied the allegations and has not been charged, CNN affiliate WCBS has reported.  BlackBerry communication disputed  While on the stand, Jordan at first appeared calm as she described for a jury the last time she saw her son alive. Jude's vocabulary was limited. He typed on a BlackBerry to communicate with her.  "We were typing throughout some period of time. We were saying goodbye to each other," Jordan told the jury and then began to cry.  "At some point, I put the pills together," she recalled. "I gave him the pills."  "Which drugs did you give him more of?" Brenner asked.  "A lot more of the Ambien," she said. "I gave him more Xanax, but the Ambien is the one I gave him the most of. I gave him Hydrocodone, which were large. I was drinking a vodka orange and there was a little left. I broke up the pill and put it into the juice mixed with vodka."  But the prosecution challenged the idea that Jude was actually communicating via a BlackBerry through the use of a controversial method known as "facilitated communication."  Some witnesses described how Jordan held the device in one hand while supporting and possibly guiding her son's arm with the other as Jude looked away. Bogdanos questioned whether a young autistic boy would even know how to use and spell words like "aggressively" and "sadistic."  Brenner sought to show that Jordan, believing she was ultimately protecting her son, brought the drugs to the hotel room with the intention of killing them both, but she survived the suicide attempt.  Prosecutors said the killing was premeditated and Jordan expected to survive.  As Jude lay dying, the prosecution said, Jordan sent an email to a financial adviser instructing him to transfer the $125,000 trust she set up for her son to her personal account.  In addition, Jordan transferred $8 million from a savings to a checking account before checking into the hotel with her son.  Jordan told the jury she planned on giving the money to charity before taking her life.  
 Tucson, Arizona It was a day and an event like so many othersuntil it wasn't.  Six people were killed and 12 others wounded, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, when a gunman opened fire in front of a Safeway supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, authorities said. The congresswoman had been hosting a meeting with constituents Saturday morning when the attack began.  Dr. Steven Rayle told CNN's Wolf Blitzer he was about 10 feet away from Giffords when the gunman shot the congresswoman.  "He continued to fire, sort of rapidly, really at point-blank range. And the way things were set up, people really had no route to escape. They were sort of hemmed in by the architecture and the things around there," he said.  After a moment of hesitation, Rayle said he ducked behind a concrete post, then laid on the ground so as not to be a target.  Rayle said the suspect "had a sort of determined look on his face" as he opened fire.  "He was not sort of going around and picking out people and firing at them ... He was just firing his gun indiscriminately," he said.  The 22-year-old suspect, who law enforcement sources identified as Jared Lee Loughner, was trying to reload when he was tackled to the ground, another witness said.  The gun, which another bystander had wrestled from the gunman, was empty and cocked open. The shooter had another magazine at the ready, Joe Zamudio told CNN.  "He was ready for war. He was not playing around," Zamudio said. "He was going to keep shooting. It was not over. He had just ran out of bullets."  Zamudio said he was one of the bystanders who pinned the gunman to the ground until police showed up.  Jason Pekau, who works at a nearby store, said he heard the gunshots from 50 yards away.  "It sounded like tons of pots and pans falling down on the ground right next to my ear it was so loud," he said.  He described a chaotic scene in the parking lot immediately after the attack.  "I just saw people running, screaming towards where the shooting happened. Everyone screaming that it was Gabrielle Giffords," he said.  Witnesses told him she was shot "point-blank in the head," Farley said.  "I did see them take her away on a stretcher," Pekau said about the congresswoman. "She was moving, from what I saw with my own eyes."  Giffords may owe her survival to a quick-thinking intern, an Arizona state legislator told CNN.  Arizona state Rep. Steve Farley said Daniel Hernandez, his former campaign managerand a trained nursewas interning for Giffords and staffing Saturday's meet-and-greet event.  "He said that when he was in the back ... he heard shots in the front. He rushed to see what had happened. Gabby was on the floor," Farley said. "He was able to use his nurse training and snapped right into it and was able to apply pressure to the wound and keep her active and alert. He rode with her in the ambulance to the hospital."  Video from the scene showed one of Giffords' banners still hanging in the storefront. Yellow tape was draped around the parking lot as police began their investigation.  Giffords won her third term in a closely contested race against a Tea Party-sponsored candidate and was one of three Democratic legislators who reported vandalism at their offices following the March vote on health care reform.  President Barack Obama spoke from Washington soon after the attack. He called it a national tragedy and underlined how simply the day beganlike any other.  "It's not surprising that today, Gabby was doing what she was always doeslistening to the hopes and concerns of her neighbors," said Obama, referring to the congresswoman by her nickname. "That is the essence of what our democracy is all about."

 A 19-year-old Mississippi man was charged with capital murder Tuesday in the death of an African-American man who died after allegedly being beaten by a group of white teens and run over by a truck, authorities said.  Deryl Paul Dedmon, 19, of Brandon, Mississippi was also charged by a grand jury with hate-crime enhancement in the murder of James Craig Anderson, said Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith.  The indictment alleges that Dedmon killed Anderson while in the commission of committing felony robbery, Smith said in a statement.  Anderson's family, however, is asking state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty in the case.  Relatives of Anderson, who died shortly after receiving his injuries on June 26, sent a letter with their request to Smith, saying the family is opposed to the death penalty partly for religious reasons.  The indictment against Dedmon alleged Anderson was targeted because of his race.  Dedmon's arraignment has yet to be scheduled, Smith said.  Federal authorities have joined the local investigation, and both authorities are determining "the appropriate venue for the prosecution of any remaining suspects," Smith's statement said.  "All options are being considered and with each passing day, more evidence is being gathered," Smith said.  The death of Anderson, 48, occurred early June 26 in Jackson, allegedly at the hands of white teens who, after a night of partying and drinking, decided to go looking for black people to assault, law enforcement officials have said, quoting one of the suspects in the case.  Watch: Incident caught on video  Anderson's death drew national attention after CNN first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the killing, captured by a parking lot security camera in a Jackson suburb.  Smith, the district attorney, has called it "vicious" and a "premeditated hate crime."  The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the death as a possible federal hate crime and assisting local prosecutors. The killing has also prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in Jackson, a city of about 175,000 people.  A second teen, John Aaron Rice, 18, was initially charged with murder, but a judge reduced the charge to simple assault because Rice was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill Anderson.  However, Hinds County prosecutors have said they plan to seek indictments against Rice for murder and a hate crime, and will seek indictments against other teens who were at the scene.  The district attorney's office has not officially commented on the family's request for no death penalty in the case.  Last week, the Anderson family filed a wrongful death suit against all seven of the white teens alleged to have been present at the beating of Anderson that immediately preceded him being run over by the truck. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nationally recognized organization based in Montgomery, Alabama, that opposes racism and intolerance, joined the lawsuit.  In addition to Dedmon and Rice, the lawsuit names five other teens as taking part in the incident: Sarah Graves of Crystal Springs; Shelbie Richards of Pearl; and William Kirk Montgomery, John Blaylock and Dylan Butler, all of Brandon. None of the five has been arrested or charged.  Anderson, a line worker at a Nissan plant, sang in his church choir, according to the family's attorney, Winston J. Thompson III. He leaves behind his partner of 17 years.  Attorneys for Dedmon and Rice have not responded to requests for comment from CNN.  During a recent bond hearing, Dedmon's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the "racial allegations."  A civil trial can proceed at the same time as a criminal case, but often the civil case is delayed pending the resolution of a criminal trial. While a criminal case is pending, a defendant in a civil case may need to invoke the Fifth Amendment.  Authorities believe Dedmon led and instigated the attack, which took place after a night of drinking in largely white Rankin County, outside Jackson.  The gang of teens climbed into Dedmon's green truck and a white SUV and drove 16 miles to the western edge of Jackson. They would have seen Anderson immediately as they exited the highway, officials said. He was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp.  On the videotape obtained exclusively by CNN, the group of teens is seen pulling into the parking lot and stopping where Anderson is standing, although he is just off camera and not visible.  The teens can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson.  Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson's beating took place, as the teens yelled racial epithets, including "white power."  Authorities allege Dedmon and many of the other teens pummeled Anderson repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground, although this is not visible on the tape. After the beating, some of the teens left and others got into the green Ford truck.  At this moment, Anderson becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walks toward the truck.  "Defendant Dedmon drove the F-250 out of the parking lot and turned right onto Ellis Avenue," the lawsuit says. "Just as Dedmon turned right, his headlights shone directly on Anderson, who, having been severely beaten, was stumbling in a grassy area near the motel's entrance. Dedmon accelerated, drove onto and over the street curb, and struck Anderson with the front of the F-250."  Shortly afterward, Dedmon allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing, according to statements some of the teens made to detectives. "I ran that n----- over," he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the teens in the other car.  The proceedings of the case are taking place in the Hinds County courthouse, where in 1994 Byron de la Beckwith was convicted in the notorious killing of civil rights leader Medgar Evers in 1963.  CNN Special Investigation Unit's Drew Griffin and Scott Bronstein contributed to this report.

Washington The federal government will recognize gay marriages in Michigan that occurred between recent conflicting court rulings, Attorney General Eric Holder announced Friday.  Holder's statement said couples married on March 22, before an appellate court blocked a previous ruling allowing gay marriage in Michigan, "will be eligible for all relevant federal benefits on the same terms as other same-sex marriages."  His decision is the latest move by the Obama administration toward legalizing gay marriage in the United States. The divisive issue pits social and religious conservatives against liberals and moderates, with polls showing a majority of Americans in support of gay marriage.  On March 21, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman struck down Michigan's gay marriage ban as unconstitutional.  His ruling cleared the way for same-sex couples to marry immediately, and scores did the next day until the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order to temporarily stay, or put on hold, Friedman's decision.  The same appeals court extended its stay on Tuesday, causing confusion over the status of the couples married over the previous weekend.  Holder noted that Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder "has made clear that the marriages that took place on Saturday were lawful and valid when entered into, although Michigan will not extend state rights and benefits tied to these marriages pending further legal proceedings."  "For purposes of federal law ... these Michigan couples will not be asked to wait for further resolution in the courts before they may seek federal benefits to which they are entitled," Holder said, citing a previous decision in a similar situation in Utah.  Voters in Utah, Michigan and nine other states passed constitutional amendments in 2004 defining marriage as one man and one woman.  Friedman's ruling was the latest in a series of recent similar decisions affecting marriage restrictions in states including Texas, Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma. In most of those cases, the judicial orders did not take effect immediately.  However, Michigan's did and, as in Utah, same-sex couples immediately got marriage licenses before later court decisions halted such unionsat least for now, as higher courts weigh in.  Last June, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision that rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act while ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits.  
 Cairo A former Egyptian interior minister and his aides ordered the killings of anti-government protesters in the days before Hosni Mubarak was overthrown, according to testimony from an Egyptian security official, an attorney told CNN on Thursday.  The allegation comes during the trial of Mubarak, now adjourned till Sunday. The former Egyptian leader is charged with ordering the killing of protesters to quash the uprising in February that ultimately ended his 30-year rule. In addition to accusations of ordering the killing of protesters, Mubarak faces corruption charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.  Maj. Esam Shawky, who works in the administrative department in charge of anti-riot security forces, testified Thursday that Habib el-Adly and his aides ordered the killings and gave the order to cut Internet services on January 28 amid the unrest, lawyer Khaled Abou Bakr said.  Bakr, who is attending the trial, is suing Mubarak on behalf of a victim who was shot and injured during protests.  He said Shawky also told the court that he instructed the country's general prosecutor to save voice recordings between el-Adly and his assistants before they were destroyed.  The assertions were based on a January 27 meeting between el-Adly and his aides. Mubarak, asked by the judge if he had any reaction, had no comment. El-Adly disputed the testimony and said minutes of the meeting show discussions revolved around containing the protests, not dispersing them.  Another witness, Gen. Hussein Abdel Hamid, attended the meeting and testified that he objected to el-Adly's orders of arming the security forces and implementing a plan to "handle the protesters at any cost." Hamid said he was transferred to the Cairo security headquarters to take a course on "the art of dispersing protesters."  Earlier this week, clashes erupted outside the courtroom between security forces and families of those killed in this year's uprisings. But Thursday, there were only a handful of victims' families and no sign of Mubarak supporters.  Top Egyptian figures will be testifying next week behind closed doors in the trial. The prosecutor general banned media from reporting testimony that may emerge from those sessions because of "national security matters."  Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, is set to appear Sunday, and Gen. Sami Anan, Armed Forces chief of staff, will go before the court Monday.  The former vice president and head of Egyptian intelligence, Omar Suleiman, is scheduled to testify Tuesday.  Interior Minister Mansour Essawy will appear Wednesday, and his predecessor, Mahmoud Wagdy, is set to testify the following day.  About 840 people died and more than 6,000 were wounded in the 18 days of uprising that toppled Mubarak, according to Amnesty International.  Mubarak is the first leader toppled in this year's Arab Spring revolts to face a judge. Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was tried in absentia after he was deposed in January and fled to Saudi Arabia.  The trial is expected to last at least six months to a year, according to Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor.

Beijing A goodwill basketball game between a U.S. college and a Chinese military team turned into an ugly brawl, leaving a black-eye on sports diplomacy.  The game between the Georgetown team, which is in on a trip to China, and the Bayi Rockets escalated into an on-court fracas Thursday.  With about 10 minutes left into the exhibition game and the score tied at 64, players exchanged blows, triggering a bench-clearing melee.  Match organizers failed to keep order on the court. Irate Chinese spectators hurled plastic bottles onto the court as the Georgetown players headed for the locker room.  The American collegiate team is on a 10-day trip as part of a program to promote goodwill through sports.  The goodwill match coincided with Vice President Joe Biden's official visit to China.  A day earlier, Biden watched another exhibition game between the Hoyas and another Chinese team. Few mainstream Chinese media reported the Thursday fracas.  The brawl forced the game to end early, Chinese newspaper Yangzi Evening News reported. It was "very physical from the beginning" and the situation deteriorated, says the report.  "All substitute players from both teams got involved after the brawl broke out."  An amateur video on YouTube shows a Chinese player pushing a U.S. player to the ground and punching him repeatedly. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.  The Bayi Rockets is an army team that plays in the China Basketball Association, the local professional league. Most of their players serve in the People's Liberation Army.  CNN could not reach the Bayi Rockets for comment, but Georgetown head coach John Thompson III expressed his regrets.  "Tonight, two great teams played a very competitive game that unfortunately ended after heated exchanges with both teams," Thompson said. "We sincerely regret that this situation occurred."  The brawl drew comments on Chinese social media, with links to video posted on Chinese websites. However, some of the video postings have been deleted without explanation.  Many comments criticize Bayi Rocket players. "(The players') Basketball skills are not very hot but their temper is hot," says @alesfu on Tencent Weibo, China's second-largest social media.  @Chinanoe writes: "Most of sportsmen have muscular limbs with simple mind."  For decades, Chinese sports promoted the slogan "friendship first, competition second."  In recent years, however, competition for prizes, honor and fame have sometimes trumped sportsmanship.  Violence and brawls have erupted in some team sports like basketball and soccer games.  In October, an exhibition match between China and Brazil national teams ended in a bench-clearing fistfight.  The next day, the Chinese national federation apologized to Brazil. China's head coach, Bob Donewald, an American, along with three players and three match officials were suspended for a few games by the Federation of International Basketball Association.  
 "Why aren't you dead?"  "You should die."  "Wait a minute, why are you still alive?"  "Go kill yourself."  It's impossible to comprehend another human being, let alone a child, sending such hateful messages to another person, but according to Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd in Lakeland, Florida, these messages are all too real.  They were sent to 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick, who ultimately jumped to her death in September, he said. The messages didn't come via the social networking sites many of us are familiar with: Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. They were sent via newer, lesser-known social applications called Ask.fm and Kik, according to Judd.  "These apps are free, and as a result ... you can either go up anonymously or create a fictitious identification, and you can torment other children, and it is frightening to see that occur," the sheriff said.  Sheriff: Taunting post leads to arrests in Rebecca Sedwick bullying  And now, two girls, ages 12 and 14, are charged with felony aggravated stalking in the case, the sheriff told CNN Tuesday. "We take bullying and cyberbullying exceptionally serious in this county and always have," he said in an earlier interview.  Tricia Norman, Sedwick's mother, thought she was doing everything she could to protect her daughter from the bullying she was experiencing. She sent her to a different school and closed down her Facebook page, according to The New York Times.  She had no idea her daughter was using apps such as Ask.fm and Kik, and was being tormented on the new platforms. "I had never even heard of them; I did go through her phone but didn't even know," she told the Times.  "Even though (Rebecca) was separated from the bullies because she was in a different school ... ultimately they were able to get back and I don't know if it's pick at each other but certainly say hateful things," said Judd, whose office is investigating the case.  Share your bullying story  'Parents don't know about them'  In conversations with law enforcement, educators, bullying experts and parents, it's clear that while parents may be getting up to speed on some social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, there are plenty of other platforms popular with tweens and teens that parents don't know.  In addition to Ask.fm and Kik, there's Voxer, which is a walkie-talkie-type app for messaging, and Snapchat, which allows the sender to set a time limit for how long recipients can view their photo, text or video messages. (Check out our gallery above for other sites your teen might be using!)  "The biggest part of these sites is parents don't know about them," said Sue Scheff, author of the book "Wit's End: Advice and Resources for Saving Your Out-of-control Teen."  Are we too quick to cry 'bully'?  "What happens is a new site, we won't find out about it until a tragedy happens but the kids know about it," Scheff said. "It's as simple as that. No one really knew a lot about Ask.fm until Rebecca died."  How children are using the sites is a concern for parents and educators across the country. Brian Lidle, the principal at Ann Simpson Davis Middle School in Dublin, Ohio, said he's seen as many as a dozen cases of student harassment on Kik during the past several months.  "It's just a very difficult thing to see, a child being harassed by nameless, faceless people and feel ganged up on," Lidle said. He said that  the school has gone to the authorities but that Kik has not shared information about who is behind the harassing accounts.  "We were very frustrated at that point, so what we decided to do is really get the parents in the mix," Lidle said. "And as we get information in, I've been sharing that with our parents through our e-mail list service and just to make sure they know what apps are out there, what's happening to them."  In response to an interview request from CNN, a Kik spokesman said the Canada-based company "actively cooperates with law enforcement agencies all over the world to help ensure the safety of our users."  Hanna Smith suicide fuels calls for action on Ask.fm cyberbullying  "The safety and well-being of our users is extremely important to us," spokesman Bob Patterson said. He said the site has added new features over the past few years, such as the ability to block other users without revealing they've been blocked. The company also developed a parent guide to provide information about "how parents can help their teens ... have a great (and safe) experience on Kik."  "Kik has policies in place to help us respond in the best way possible when something is reported to us by one of our users, or if we are contacted by law enforcement," Patterson added.  As for Ask.fm, in a statement, a spokesman said that in light of recent events, the Latvia-based company is working with online child safety expert Annie Mullins to review and update its safety and privacy policies to ensure that its "abuse and inappropriate content reporting systems are among the most effective in the industry."  "We are committed to doing everything we can to protect our users and stamp out bullying or any other kind of abuse. Sadly bullying can take place anywhereon or offlineso it is important we, parents and users work together to fight it," the statement said.  "If a user sees something that isn't appropriate before we do, we would ask that they help us stand up to bullies by reporting it. Any complaints made about this kind of abuse are prioritised automatically and will be dealt with immediately."  Coach suspends entire football team after bullying  Teens want to be 'validated'  Why are kids downloading these apps? Sameer Hinduja, criminology professor at Florida Atlantic University and co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center, says part of the appeal of platforms like Ask.fmwhere you create a profile and allow people to ask you questionsis the need for affirmation.  "You need to be validated when you're a teenager because you are wondering if you're turning out OK, and so these sites completely meet that need," Hinduja said. "Because it's like, 'This is so great. Someone asked me a question. Someone took the time to visit my profile ... and like my picture and leave a comment.'  "I understand why kids do it, but there's way more negatives than positives that could possibly come out of it, and if I were raising a son or daughter, I would be like, 'Why do you care so much about people asking you these questions and demonstrating interest in you this way, because it opens you up for more harassment,' " said Hinduja, co-author of "Words Wound: Delete Cyberbullying and Make Kindness Go Viral," a book for teens to be released in December.  If you are a parent and you are slightly freaked right now, I can relate. I can't even imagine what apps, sites and platforms will be around when my kids, who are 5 and 7, are in the middle and high school years.  But Hinduja, whose site has numerous resources for parents, says parents can feel empowered rather than overwhelmed by being as actively involved in their kids' online lives as they are in their offline lives. That means being familiar with the technology but not necessarily declaring sites like Ask.fm and Kik off-limits.  "Kids don't want to hear us preach and lecture about all of (technology's) evils. They will immediately tune out," Hinduja said.  The better approach, he said, is to embrace the latest technology and strike up conversations with your kids about it, asking them about stories of bullying and harassment in the news.  "Constantly having these conversations with kids so that they know their parent is not oblivious to these issues goes such a long way," he said.  Advertisers pull out after social media suicide  Lidle, the middle school principal, agrees and encourages parents to plunge fully into their kids' online world.  "This is not our world that kids are operating in," Lidle said. "They call us digital immigrants. We have to immerse ourselves in what's going on in their world, as uncomfortable as it is. Our kids are at stake, and we cannot drop the vigilance of knowing what's going on in their worlds."  Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said parents should also keep open communication with their kids' friends.  "A lot of times, you'll hear from your children's friends before you hear from your own child," he said.  Join us October 29 for a Google Hangout on bullying  'Say those few kind words'  Scheff, the parent advocate and author, believes parents and educators can also teach our kids to be "cybershields" for other children.  She wonders what might have happened if any of the 15 or so kids believed to have been cyberbullying Rebecca Sedwick decided to protect her instead.  "Wonder if they decided ... 'Hey listen, we can do something to be kind to this girl. Let's say ... your hair looks nice today. You look pretty today. Don't listen to these girls. You have a reason to live. You don't have to do this. ... Don't think you have to end your life,' " Scheff said.  "All it would take is a few words in the opposite way, and that's what (kids) need to learn, how to say those few kind words."  Follow Kelly Wallace on Twitter and like CNN Living on Facebook.

Ajdabiya, Libya The Libyan military bombed two key towns in the east again Thursday, stepping up efforts to reclaim a region lost to rebels.  The aircraft targeted al-Brega and Ajdabiya, both of which were hit with bombs Wednesday.  Opposition forces told CNN they were forging ahead, working to maintain their positions and fend off attacks by pro-Gadhafi forces. Rebels have armed themselves in some cases by raiding military installations and police stations.  Morale on the part of the opposition seems to be high, while morale among Gadhafi's forceswhich have seen defections as some members of the military have joined the protestsseems low, CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from eastern Libya.  Libyan jets Thursday dropped two bombs over al-Bregaone near a military checkpoint and one near the main gate to a refinery, witnesses reported.  In Ajdabiya,a tribal leader said the military dropped two bombs on military camps. Witnesses told CNN one bomb was near an ammunition depot.  The situation in Libya is different from those in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, where uprisings turned into revolutions that overthrew their rulers. Libya is facing a battle between government forces and rebel forces. "This is becoming a war," Wedeman tweeted.  The more Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi uses aerial attacks, the more pressing discussions become in the West about imposing a no-fly zone over the country.  U.S. military and diplomatic officialsincluding Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen and Secretary of State Hillary Clintonhave all said enacting a no-fly zone is complicated and risky, and international support for the idea is not there yet.  "If it's ordered, we can do it," Gates said, but imposing a no-fly zone "begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses."  Libya's deputy U.N. ambassador, Ibrahim al-Dabashi, appealed to the United Nations to impose a no-fly zone over the country after he broke with Gadhafi's regime and expressed support for the protesters more than a week ago.  U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday the United States is examining a "full range of options" in the Libyan crisis.  There is a danger of a "bloody stalemate" in Libya, he said, adding that he wants to be sure the United States "has the capacity to act quickly in event of humanitarian crisis."  "Col. Gadhafi needs to step down from power and leave," Obama said.  "It's the right thing to do."   The president also warned that advisers to Gadhafi need to understand that they will be held accountable for any violence they perpetrate against civilians.  "They should know history is moving against Col. Gadhafi," Obama said.  The Arab League Wednesday rejected foreign intervention, saying Libya is facing "an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments."  But the league cannot ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue, said Hisham Yousef, chief of staff of the Arab League.  Gadhafi's regime Thursday sought to create an impression that it still controls the vast majority of the country, with rebels in charge of only pockets.  The government organized a trip for a CNN crew to visit a refinery in Zawiya controlled by the government. Rebels control the center of the city, but the refinery is on the outskirts.  The refinery, Libya's second largest, is operating at 80% of its capacity, officials told CNN's Nic Robertson. Managers said that while the refinery had not come under attack, some staff members had been unable to get to work.  Protesters calling for the ouster of longtime leader Gadhafi have taken to the streets for a third week amid clashes with government forces. He has been in power for nearly 42 years.  Musa Ibrahim, a spokesman for Gadhafi's regime, told CNN, "We need tribal intervention, social intervention to help us convince these people to come to the negotiating table."  The government spokesman denied any attacks on peaceful protesters despite numerous reports from the country of unarmed demonstrators being shot indiscriminately.  More than 1,000 people are reported to have been killed and many more injured during the protests, according to the United Nations. Libya's ambassador to the United States has estimated that the death toll was about 2,000.  The International Criminal Court Thursday said Gadhafi and some of his sons and advisers are under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity.  "I would like to use this opportunity to put them on notice," ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo told CNN. "I want to be clear: If their troops commit crimes, they could be made criminally responsible."  It is the first time the court will be investigating claims as they are allegedly occurring.  Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which created the ICC, and does not recognize the authority of the international court. But the United Nations Security Council referred the matter to the court, essentially giving it "jurisdiction" over the situation in Libya, the court said.  Nations have scrambled to evacuate hundreds of citizens as the unrest continues.  The Netherlands defense ministry said Thursday that three Dutch navy personnel were captured by armed men loyal to Gadhafi during an evacuation operation Sunday. The ministry did not release information earlier because of safety reasons.  Libyan state TV said the personnel were in a fighter helicopter and did not have permission from Libyan authorities to enter.  The state TV report showed pictures of those believed to be the crew, as well as the helicopter and images of weapons.  The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya's borders into Egypt and Tunisia, and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders.  Obama said he approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help return to Egypt those Egyptian citizens who have fled to Tunisia to escape the unrest in Libya.  Obama said he has also authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to charter civilian aircraft to help people from other countries get back home.

 Alisa Weinstein was thrilled when she heard about Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release. She hopes her father will be next.  Gunmen abducted Warren Weinstein nearly three years ago from his home in Lahore, Pakistan. They posed as neighbors, offered food and then pistol-whipped the American aid worker and tied up his guards.  Now he's being held by al Qaeda. And as political backlash over the controversial prisoner swap for Bergdahl grows, Weinstein's daughter says her happiness for the soldier and his family has turned to worry.  "We started to realize that the administration is going to be a lot less likely to do this again if it causes some political problems for them," she told CNN's "AC360" on Wednesday. "So does that mean that the door is closed for us?"  For years, when Warren Weinstein's case came up, U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington wouldn't bargain with al Qaeda.  Now, Alisa Weinstein says it's clear that negotiating is an option.  "They have shown with this exchange that they can get this done. If they want to, they can do this," she said. "So I know that they can do it for us and they can do it for others."  Just as health was a concern for U.S. officials who negotiated Bergdahl's release, Weinstein says she's worried about her 72-year-old father's health. He has a heart condition and severe asthma, she said, and a video of him released by al Qaeda on Christmas showed he's suffering.  "It was clear from that video that he is not in good physical condition. He was incredibly pale and gaunt. His voice was weak. ... My father is certainly not in good health," she said.  Listening to Obama administration officials justify the swap by pointing out that Bergdahl was a soldier doesn't ease her worries.  "My father is just as deserving of freedom as Sgt. Bergdahl, as are all of the Americans who are being held abroad," she said. "You cannot distinguish between these hostages. ... They can't just pick and choose, decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there."  Just a few months after Weinstein's capture, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a recording claiming the terror group was holding Weinsteinand demanding, among other things, an end to airstrikes by the United States.  He described the captive as "a former employee and a current contractor working with the U.S. government in its aid program to Pakistan, which aims to fight the jihad in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and just like the Americans arrest any suspect linked to al Qaeda and the Taliban, even if they were far related."  Weinstein was employed by J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia, that is a USAID contractor. He is a world-renowned development expert, according to the company's website.  In the video al Qaeda released of him in December, Warren Weinstein said he felt abandoned.  "Nine years ago, I came to Pakistan to help my government and I did so at a time when most Americans would not come here," he said. "And now, when I need my government, it seems I have been totally abandoned and forgotten."  What about other Americans held captive?

Dallas, Texas  The modern Tea Party movement began on February 27, 2009, when small groups in 22 American cities gathered to protest the signing of President Obama's stimulus bill.  The Tea Party groups viewed the stimulus bill as the crowning moment of decades of irresponsible government fiscal behavior. The federal government is addicted to spending, and the consequences are now staring us in the face.  Our national debt is at emergency levels and growing rapidly. Congressional Budget Office head Doug Elmendorf recently said the nation's fiscal path is simply "unsustainable." And yet this financial crisis seems obvious to virtually everyone except our elected officials in Washington.  Tea Party members are not averse to paying taxes. However, taxpayers are stretched thin, and piling more taxes on their backs is not the answer. We do not understand nor approve of Washington's insatiable appetite for spending, because that's not the way we as individuals live. We do not massively overspend today and borrow money tomorrow to cover the bills. As California and New York are learning, that ride eventually comes to an end.  This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said, "To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some combination of the above."  The Tea Party endorses massive reductions of federal spending before any consideration of new taxes is brought to the table. Tea Party members clearly understand Bernanke's warning. If something drastic is not done soon, our entire financial system and way of life will collapse.  The Tea Party's goal from inception has been to replace big-spending politicians from both political parties with common-sense, fiscally responsible leaders. America has moved away from the vision of our Founding Fathers who advocated for a nuanced balance between federal and state power. As America has drifted from constitutional values, federal power has grown.  We have gone from a nation of self-sufficient producers to a nation divided between overburdened taxpaying producers and some nonproducers who exist on welfare from cradle to grave.  So what would the Tea Party movement recommend to set America on its rightful course?  Federal spending must immediately be drastically slashed across the board: Abolish the useless departments of Education and Agriculture, among others; get rid of the EPA; and repeal the stimulus bill and other pork spending. These are millstones around the neck of the American taxpayer and our economy.  Send all responsibilities of these agencies back to the states where they can be better and more efficiently managed. Foreign aid and Pentagon spending must be equally constrained and reduced.  Second, the number of government jobs must be substantially cut, and those employees must return to the private sector. Overpaid bureaucrats with fat benefits and pensions not found in the real world are simply not needed. Or wanted.  Third, fraud and welfare waste must be eliminated. Welfare and unemployment benefits must be drastically cut.  Welfare, health and education services for illegal immigrants must be eliminated.  The Center for Immigration Studies recently reported that 33 percent of immigrant households use some kind of "welfare." Again, who pays? The American taxpayer!  Government must get completely out of the private sector. Market freedoms must prevail for America to be successful. Government control over our financial and insurance industries, major manufacturing, health care and energy is a sure recipe for disaster.  Washington bureaucrats are simply incapable of efficiency. The Tea Party is determined to send new, fiscally responsible leaders to Washington to trim government fatand not with scalpels, but with chainsaws.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Phillip Dennis.  
 "It's showtime!"  Michael Keaton paid homageever so slightlyto his roles in "Beetlejuice" and "Batman" in his third turn hosting "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.  Keaton acknowledged in his opening monologue that a lot has changed since he first hosted the comedy sketch show in 1982.  "I had a babyhe's 31. I also have a new girlfriendshe's 28," he said.  Fans who were hoping for a full-blown revival of Keaton's most memorable characters might have been a little disappointed. SNL cast members Taran Killam and Bobby Moynihan begged the actor with a song to "play" Batman and Beetlejuice with them.  All they got in response were a couple of one-liners.  Overall, Keaton's performance drew high marks from viewers and critics for its "deadpan" manner and "unpredictable weirdness," in the words of A.V. Club's Dennis Perkins. Fans also delighted in a cameo from "Walking Dead" star Norman Reedus during Weekend Update.  Keaton scored some laughs from the audience as an ad executive who's not very good at his job, a confused grandfather and a high school teacher who gets asked to the prom in a riff on the romantic comedy "She's All That."  Other crowd-pleasing spots included a Scientology parody music video and a news conference spoofing the NCAA student-athlete debate.  The show also poked fun at CNN with cast member Cecily Strong playing anchor Brooke Baldwin.  Baldwin said on Twitter that she's taking it as a "crazy compliment" and shared a clip from the skit.

For most Americans, mosquitoes are pests whose bites leave behind itchy bumps. But in other parts of the world, mosquitoes carry a disease called malaria that kills more than a million people each year.  Mosquitoes, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, may transmit malaria to humans.  A new malaria vaccine that's about to begin human clinical trials is dependent on mosquitoesa whole lot of them. Bioengineers have been growing millions of mosquitoes in a sterile environment, letting them feed on malaria-infected blood, irradiating the bugs, extracting the disease-causing parasites and storing them for use in vaccines.  The announcement of the Food and Drug Administration's approval for clinical trials comes just days before World Malaria Day, which is Saturday. Check out the World Health Organization's site about malaria goals worldwide  The vaccine is unique among other candidates in that it uses the entire parasite and not just parts of it, said Dr. Stephen Hoffman, chief executive and scientific officer at Sanaria Inc., the Maryland-based biotechnology firm developing the vaccine.  This technique was first shown to be effective in the 1970s, but the technology didn't exist to mass-produce it for the millions of people who need it, said Dr.  Kirsten Lyke, principal investigator in the clinical trial site at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. At that time, people were immunized by being bitten by the irradiated mosquitoes.  "That is the only effective vaccine that anyone has ever really developed that works and does complete protection," said John Dame, chair of Infectious Diseases and Pathology at the University of Florida, who is not involved with the Sanaria trials.  The vaccine takes the same basic approach as standard vaccines in use for diseases such as measles and polio. In those vaccines against viruses, weakened bacteria is injected, creating an immune response without causing illness.  In the Sanaria vaccine, the body recognizes the malaria parasite as a foreign material, Lyke said. It goes to the liver, where a lot of the immune response is generated, but does not develop into a disease because the mosquito was irradiated, she said.  Clinical trials will begin in May, Hoffman said, and will include 80 immunized individuals and 24 controls. About 3,000 mosquitoes were used to produce the vaccines for the first clinical trials, he said. If these trials are successful, researchers will initiate trials on adults in Africa, and then children.  Among other vaccines in clinical trials currently, the one that is furthest along is RTS,S, developed by GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The company announced in December that this vaccine, based on a recombinant protein that uses part of the malaria parasite, was safely administered to African infants, with an efficacy of 65 percent in a three-month follow-up.  Both the Sanaria and the GlaxoSmithKline projects receive support from the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, a program at the nonprofit PATH established through an initial grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  Dame, who used to be involved with the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine, said he would guess the Sanaria vaccine will be more effective, but clinical trials will provide more information. He also noted that mass distribution to developing countries would require appropriate infrastructure, and may be more difficult depending on how long the immunization lasts.  Each year, 350 million to 500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people who die from the disease are young children in Africa south of the Sahara.  Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills and flu-like illness, the CDC said.  Although preventive measures exist, such as insecticide-treated nets and medications, there is no licensed vaccine on the market.  Moreover, effective treatments are largely too expensive for the people who need them in poor countries. The parasite has become resistant to cheaper treatments, Lyke said.  "Individuals living on $1 or $2 a day can't even afford $8 medication," Lyke said.  The U.S. military also has a keen interest in a malaria vaccine. The antimalaria drugs available have side effects such as stomach aches, said Dr. Tom Richie, director of the Navy component of the U.S. military malaria vaccine program, who provides oversight to the clinical trials.  "Malaria has been one of the most significant infectious threats to our military personnel when we deploy to tropical areas," Richie said.  The disease was the leading cause of casualties in the South Pacific theater during World War II, and also a major problem in the Vietnam War, he said.  There are five species of the malaria parasite known to infect humans. One called Plasmodium falciparum causes the vast majority of cases.  Malaria was eliminated in the United States in 1951, but there are still cases in the country, mostly from people who acquired it in high-risk countries. In 2002, there were 1,337 cases of malaria in the U.S., and all but five had been acquired abroad.  An international team at the Malaria Atlas Project recently published what researchers say is the most comprehensive map ever illustrating global malaria risk. Researchers told CNN the map offers hope that it is possible to eradicate the disease in many parts of the world.  Hoffman, former head of a U.S. Navy malaria vaccine team, started the Sanaria effort himself in the breakfast room of his house in 2003. The company now has a more official corporate headquarters in Rockville, Maryland.  "I thought that the world needed a malaria vaccine, there was no question this was the best way to make one," he said.  
 Muggles will have another opportunity to slip into Harry Potter's magical world at a new Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood.  Universal Parks CEO Tom Williams promises the planned Southern California attraction will be "every bit as spectacular" as the first Harry Potter park, which opened in 2010 at Universal Orlando in Florida. That successful Harry Potter theme park will be significantly expanded, Williams also announced Tuesday.  Hogwarts Castle, which houses the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry featured in the "Harry Potter" series, will be the Hollywood park's centerpiece, as it is in Orlando. Details on the timing of the new park and expansion have not been released.  The new California park is likely to bring millions of tourist dollars.  "It's a huge win for the Los Angeles tourism industry," said Mark Liberman, CEO of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, in a statement.  The Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. estimates the Harry Potter park will produce $147 million in spending in the county for every one million additional visitors to Universal Studios Hollywood.  The Orlando Harry Potter attraction's opening brought an immediate boost to Universal Orlando. Wizarding World's opening halfway through 2010 boosted overall paid admissions to Universal's Orlando parks by 20% in 2010 over 2009, according to financial documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

A song about the joy of thrift shops put Macklemore & Ryan Lewis on the charts, but it's their musical attack on homophobia that's earning Grammy nominations.  When the Recording Academy revealed nominations for the 56th Grammy Awards Friday night, the hip-hop duo was named in seven categories, including for best new artist, song of the year and album of the year.  "Seven is unbelievable," Lewis told CNN. "We came here hoping for one." Only Jay Z's nine nominations topped them.  A testament to their popularity came from rocker Melissa Etheridge, who won her first Grammy two decades ago. She became a Macklemore & Ryan Lewis fan when her daughter asked her to listen to their song "Same Love," which is now contending for song of the year.  Etheridge was so excited to meet the duo backstage at the Grammy nominations show, she stopped her interview with CNN to chase them down and hug them.  "I just had to tell them when something comes into the music scene, which then seeps into pop culture, you just can't take it away," Etheridge said.  Check the full nominations list  English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, who was also nominated for best new artist, said in a CNN interview that he'd rather Macklemore & Lewis win the Grammy. "They've achieved so much this year in popular culture," Sheeran said. "They really changed things doing a song about homophobia."  The other new artist Grammy contenders are English electronic music producer James Blake, hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamarwho is nominated for seven Grammys overalland country singer Kacey Musgraveswho has four nominations.  Noticeably absent from the best new artist category is Lorde, whose smash hit "Royals" did earn nominations for record of the year, song of the year and best pop solo performance. The 17-year-old New Zealand singer-songwriter's debut album "Pure Heroine" is also nominated for best pop album.  Legendary producer Jimmy Jam, who is chairman emeritus of the Recording Academy, suggested that Lorde's omission was because she, in effect, "skipped a grade" by having such a successful debut song.  "She is still very new," he told CNN. "Sometimes I think the Grammy voters like to say 'Well, let's see what else you have before we say you're the best new artist.'"  Lorde's song, which carries a message criticizing the materialism of the pop music scene, spent nine weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart this year. She performed it live on the Grammy nominations telecast Friday.  "She's pretty unstoppable right now," Jimmy Jam said. "She had a great performance tonight, which I think will resonate in people's minds. She's so young, but a great songwriter. I think the sky's the limit for her."  He compared Lorde's situation to that of Katy Perry, whose "I Kissed a Girl" was a big hit five years ago. It earned her a best female pop vocal Grammy nomination, but she was passed over for best new artist. "Grammy voters felt that one single was really good, but let's see what else she has," he said.  Perry proved since then that she is the real thing. Grammy voters nominated her "Roar" for song of the year and best pop solo performance this year.  "Blurred Lines," the Robin Thicke summer hit with T.I. and Pharrell Williams, is up for song of the year and best pop duo/group performance. Their chances of taking home a Grammy might be hurt, though, by the legal battle with the heirs of the late Marvin Gaye, who argue it ripped off his "Got to Give It Up" classic.  Pharrell Williams could still win in those categories because he's also nominated for other work in each. In all, he has seven nominations in four categories.  Justin Timberlake is also up for seven Grammys. His "The 20/20 Experience" was passed over in the album of the year category, but it is nominated for best pop vocal album. He shares a nomination with Jay Z in the best pop duo/group category for the song "Suit & Tie" and his single "Mirrors" is nominated for best pop solo performance.  Drake was nominated for five Grammys, including for best rap performance for "Started from the Bottom." The rapper canceled plans to perform at Friday's nominations telecast citing schedule complications.  Daft Punk is up for four Grammys, including record of the yearfor their hit "Get Lucky"and album of the year for "Random Access Memories."  Bruno Mars earned four Grammy nominations. His "Locked Out of Heaven" is up for record of the year and song of the year.  Country crossover singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's "Red" is nominated for album of the year and country album of the year. She's also nominated for best country duo/ group performance and best country song. She performed on Friday night's show from Australia.  Fantasia's latest album "Side Effects of You" brought the 2004 American Idol winner three Grammy nominations.  The nominations list, which has 82 categories, has several legendary names on it with new music.  Paul McCartney's "Live Kisses" is nominated in the best music film category. The former Beatle is competing for the best rock song Grammy against Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.  The best rock album Grammy competition reads almost like the billing from a 1970s rock festival with Black Sabbath, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin and Neil Young with Crazy Horse nominated. Queens of the Stone Age and Kings of Leon are the youngsters in the race.  The Grammys will be handed out in Los Angeles on January. Most of them will be announced in a pre-telecast ceremony, but the top awards will be presented in a music-filled three hour broadcast on the CBS network.  
 Atlanta Locked in a battle with her brothers over their family treasures, the daughter of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. said Thursday she'd once considered lending them but never selling them.  Bernice King says her brothers' plan to sell their father's Bible and the Nobel Peace Prize he was awarded 1964. Dexter and Martin Luther King III have sued to force their sister to turn over those items, and a judge has ordered the items stored in a safe deposit box that only the court can open until the case is resolved.  In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, Bernice King acknowledged that she had once considered selling other heirlooms, including the Spingarn Medal the NAACP awarded her father in 1957. But she said she had never believed it was acceptable to sell the Nobel Prize medal or King's traveling Bible, which was used by President Barack Obama when he was sworn in for his second term.  "At the time I agreed in 2007 to the potential transfer of certain memorabilia to the National Center for Human and Civil Rights, it was totally consistent with furthering the King legacy because of the nature of their mission," she said. "They are a civil rights center. But let it be noted that I have and always will object to the sale of the Nobel Peace Prize and Bible as I believe the sale of those items is sacrilegious and a breach of my obligation as a steward and trustee of my father's legacy."  King was assassinated in 1968, and his widow, Coretta Scott King, died in 2006.  In court papers, the King brothers submitted an e-mail inventory Bernice King wrote in 2007 that divided items from the estate of the civil rights leader into four categories: those she would be willing to sell, including the Spingarn Medal; items she would not be willing to sell, but might consider lending, such as the Nobel Peace Prize and Bible; items that had questions associated with them; and items she would have to examine before deciding.  But in Thursday's statement, Bernice King said that now, "I would not support the sale of most of the memorabilia listed in the 2007 e-mail."  The CEO of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, Doug Shipman, told CNN on Thursday that he had no comment on the legal proceedings and that his center had not bought any items from the King estate. But he said the center plans to display King papers sold several years ago by the estate and now owned by Morehouse College.  Bernice King, who was 5 when her father was assassinated, is acting as the "gatekeeper" to her father's property, said attorney William Hill, who represents the King estate. He said she has no individual claim to the property that belongs to the estate controlled by her brothers.  Wednesday, Fulton County Superior Judge Robert McBurney ordered the disputed items placed "in a safe deposit box in an unknown location." But he warned Bernice King it was likely that her brothers would be able to show "the Bible and peace prize are possessions of the estate."  According to the King brothers' complaint, King's heirs agreed in 1995 to give up their inheritance to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., but Bernice King has "secreted and sequestered" the items in question.  Bernice King has said her brothers told her on January 22 that they wanted the items so they could sell them. Her attorney, Eric Barnum, called the attempt to sell the items a "money grab," saying there's a history of the King sons taking money made from selling possessions to line their own pockets.  The judge compared Bernice King's stance against the sale of her father's possessions to Coca-Cola not wanting to sell its secret soft drink recipe. He later noted he was not trivializing the value of King's possessions with the comparison.  This is not the first time the family has been at odds over King's legacy. Over the years, the siblings have sued and countersued one another.  Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in 2008, accusing him of converting "substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America" for his own use. They agreed to a settlement, thereby avoiding a trial.

Country star Trace Adkins has decided not to sing at SeaWorld to avoid controversy over how the Orlando, Florida, theme park treats its orcas.  Adkins joins a long list of musical acts who have canceled shows that were scheduled as part of SeaWorld's "Bands, Blues & BBQ" in February and March.  "Trace prefers that the focus of his performances be on music, not on controversy," Adkins' representative said in a statement e-mailed to CNN on Thursday. "Therefore, he has decided not to proceed with this show in the midst of this debate."  The entertainers' exodus from SeaWorld's calendar begin soon after CNN broadcast the documentary "Blackfish" in October. The film tells the story of the killing of a SeaWorld trainer by an orca in 2010. It raises questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity.  Online petitions and social media postings targeted the acts who had signed on to play at the park.  Only Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery remain from the original list of acts on the event calendar. Their representatives have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for comment.  A promoter could put together a whale of a concert series with the acts that have canceled SeaWorld shows, including Trisha Yearwood, Willie Nelson, Cheap Trick, Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Martina McBride and 38 Special.  SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck confirmed Adkins' cancellation, which CNN was initially alerted to through Twitter postings Thursday.  "While we're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld, we respect the artists' decisions," Gollattscheck said in an e-mailed statement nearly identical to what was sent to CNN when others canceled last month.   "We expect that other artists will be targeted in this campaign."  Adkins' show was never officially announced, but it later appeared on his own online schedule for March 2, 2014.  The park's six-week concert scheduled disappeared from SeaWorld's website last month. It now simply promises "incredible concerts with top artists in classic rock and country music."  SeaWorld is working to book replacement acts, Gollattscheck said. "We'll announce the full lineup of bands when all artists have been confirmed."  The Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies was the first to cancel, reacting to a petition posted on Change.org.  "This is a complicated issue, and we don't claim to understand all of it, but we don't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time," the band said on its Facebook page.  "I don't agree with the way they treat their animals," Willie Nelson said on December 6 when he canceled. "It wasn't that hard a deal for me."  Sisters Nancy and Ann Wilson of Heart did not elaborate last month when they announced their decision to cancel at SeaWorld, although they acknowledged it was "due to the controversial documentary film."  "We're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld," Gollattscheck said.  SeaWorld said it would like the musical artists to learn for themselves about SeaWorld.  "The bands and artists have a standing invitation to visit any of our parks to see firsthand or to speak to any of our animal experts to learn for themselves how we care for animals and how little truth there is to the allegations made by animal extremist groups opposed to the zoological display of marine mammals," Gollattscheck said.  SeaWorld says the documentary ignores the park's conservation efforts and research.  "More than 11 million people a year visit SeaWorld parks and most will see a killer whale presentation during their visit," Gollattscheck said. "Over the course of our 50-year history hundreds of millions of people have experienced killer whales in our parks. There is tremendous appeal in that kind of inspirational and educational experience and we anticipate that killer whale display will continue for generations to come."  
 Washington After months of difficult talks, bipartisan House and Senate negotiators reached a tentative deal on a giant transportation funding bill Wednesday, multiple sources tell CNN. A formal announcement is expected late Wednesday night after the last details are hammered out and the final language is drafted, they said.  Congressional leaders said they hoped to attach the $109 billion highway bill to a measure extending a rate cut on some student loans and legislation reauthorizing national flood insurance and pass them as one bill out of the House and Senate by Friday. Doing so would let Congress beat looming deadlines when these measures expire and also would allow lawmakers to escape town for their Fourth of July recess.  Passage of the bill, which funds construction for highways, bridges and other transportation projects for two years in every state and congressional district in the nation, would be a significant accomplishment for lawmakers, who have spent much of this session mired in partisan gridlock.  Senate passes huge farm bill  Aides predicted the final bill would get large bipartisan majorities although some Republicans are likely to oppose it because they think the measure costs too much.  Both parties had to compromise on core issues.  Republicans dropped language that would have approved the Keystone XL pipeline and prevented the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating harmful coal ash waste from power plants.  New Keystone pipeline requires months of review  Democrats were forced to accept GOP demands to streamline and speed up the federal project review process of construction projects. Republicans said doing so would cut permitting times in half. Republicans also won reforms that would allow states to opt out of federal mandates to spend highway dollars on bike paths and highway beautification projects. Doing so, Republicans said, would allow states to spend more on critical infrastructure projects.  "I'm so glad House Republicans met Democrats half way, as Senate Republicans did months ago," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, the chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who said the bill will "protect and create 3 million jobs."  "At the end of the day, Senate Democrats fought for red tape, while House Republicans fought for jobsand got some important wins," said a House GOP leadership aide. "This bill is far from perfect, but it is a substantial improvement over the original Senate bill."  Although the agreement includes many of the reforms the House GOP pushed for, it falls far short of the broader transportation and energy bill that House Speaker John Boehner unveiled earlier this year.  Boehner: Holder contempt vote will proceed  Boehner framed that proposal, which combined road and bridge projects with provisions promoting greater domestic energy productionsuch as more drilling in public lands and approval of the Keystone XL pipelineas a major jobs bill. But internal GOP divisions forced House Republican leaders to pull the measure and it never got a floor vote. The energy portions of the bill did pass the House, but none of those were included in the final bill.

Small arms fire targeted U.N. monitors in Syria as they tried to get to the scene of another massacre, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Thursday.  No one was hit, said a spokeswoman for Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, head of the U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria.  The incident came as Ban, international envoy Kofi Annan and others implored the U.N. General Assembly to stop the violence in Syria, which started 15 months ago when a tough Syrian crackdown against peaceful protesters developed into an uprising.  The latest massacre occurred on Wednesday in the village of Qubeir, west of Hama, and included reports that dozens of civilians, including women and children, were killed.  Massacre details are eerily familiar  Ban said the U.N. monitors had been denied access to the area but were working to get to the scene.  "I just learned a few minutes ago that while trying to do so, the U.N. monitors were shot at by small arms," he said.  Mood said observers heading to the village to verify reports of the killings had been blocked by soldiers and civilians. Residents told observers they would be at risk if they were to enter the village.  "Despite these challenges, the observers are still working to get into the village to try to establish the facts on the ground," Mood said. "UNSMIS is concerned about the restriction imposed on its movement as it will impede our ability to monitor, observe and report."  Annan, the joint U.N.-Arab League special envoy tasked with forging peace in Syria, told assembly members Thursday that Syrians could face worse troubles if peace isn't made.  Speaking before the U.N. General Assembly, Annan said his six-point plan isn't working and the "crisis is escalating."  "If things do not change, the future is likely to be one of brutal repression, massacres, sectarian violence and even all-out civil war," Annan said. "All Syrians will lose."  The violence is worsening and the country is becoming more polarized and radicalized, he said. "Despite the acceptance of the six-point plan and the deployment of a courageous mission of United Nations observers to Syria, I must be frank and confirm that the plan is not being implemented," he added.  Annan said Arab League ministers he addressed Saturday had "offered concrete ideas on how to increase pressure for compliance."  "Clearly, the time has come to determine what more can be done to secure implementation of the plan and/or what other options exist to address the crisis," he said.  He spoke in the wake of the killings in Qubeir and, two weeks ago, in Houla. More than 100 people, including women and children, were killed in Houla. Opposition activists blamed government forces and allied militia, an assertion denied by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  "Those responsible for perpetrating these crimes must be held to account," Annan said. "We cannot allow mass killing to become part of everyday reality in Syria."  Militia does regime's 'dirty work," analysts say  He said he urged al-Assad nine days ago to "change his military posture and honor his commitments to the six-point plan."  But Assad "believed the main obstacle was the actions of militants," Annan said. "Clearly, all parties must cease violence. But equally clearly, the first responsibility lies with the government."  Though Syria has released some detainees and there has been agreement "on modalities for humanitarian assistance," more is required, Annan said.  Since he and Assad spoke, "shelling of cities has intensified" and "government-backed militia has free rein with appalling consequences."  Annan said armed opposition forces haven't seen a "reason to respect cessation of hostilities" and "have intensified their attacks." Referring to bombings in Damascus and Aleppo, he said the situation is "made more complex" by attacks that are "indicative of the presence of a third actor." Some analysts say jihadist groups are responsible for those acts.  Annan called for "consequences if compliance is not forthcoming," and said "a clearer course for a peaceful transition" must be charted to resolve the crisis.  Annan was to address the Security Council in New York.  Syrian Ambassador to the U.N. Bashar Jaafari reiterated that anti-government terrorists, and not the regime, are responsible for the bloodshed. The government said terrorists timed the latest massacre to coincide with the U.N. meetings in order to make the regime look bad.  He added that Syria "is ready to receive an investigation committee from neutral countries that respect the U.N. charter and reject any intervention in the Syrian affairs," according to the government's Syrian Arab News Agency.  Jaafari said Syria is open to reform and to dialogue, and that it has no problem with the opposition. However, he said, some opposition forces composed of outside elements are taking up arms and have no desire for reconciliation.  Opposition activists accuse forces loyal to al-Assad of the killings at Qubeir, and they placed the number of dead at 78.  Regime forces shelled Qubeir before militias used knives, guns and AK-47 rifles to kill residents, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.  About 40 victims of the attack were buried in a mass grave Thursday, according to a youth activist whom CNN is not naming for safety reasons. Shabihaor pro-government gangstook other bodies to neighboring villages, the activist said.  More than half of those killed were women and children, said a local activist who reported having carried bodies.  CNN cannot independently confirm reports from within Syria because the government limits access by international journalists.  The recent violence has revived calls to isolate the regime and toughen sanctions.  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, meeting Thursday in Istanbul with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, called the latest violence "simply unconscionable." She reiterated the U.S. stance that al-Assad must go and the international community must unite around a plan for Syria after al-Assad.  Clinton said it is important to give Annan's peace initiative "the last amount of support we can muster."  Davutoglu, whose country has been critical of the al-Assad regime's actions, said all members of the U.N. Security Council must work together to stop the regime's actions.  China and Russia, regime allies, have stressed their opposition to outside interference in Syria while continuing to back Annan's plan. As permanent Security Council members, the two nations have used their veto powers to block draft resolutions against the regime.  Meeting Thursday in Shanghai, leaders of Russia, China and four Central Asian nations signed a statement opposing outside intervention in Syria. The statement calls for "dialogues that respect Syria's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity."  China, Russia call for non-intervention  The United States plans to send a delegation to Russia this week to press for tough action against the Syrian regime, a senior State Department official said.  At least 15 people were killed Thursday in Syria, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.  The United Nations for months has said more than 9,000 people have died in Syria. But death counts from opposition groups range from more than 12,000 to more than 14,000. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced.

 Picture a colossal empire of little houses stacked on top of each other. Visualize them connected by staircases snaking under dangling wires, through corridors so dark even police were rumored to be afraid of them.  Now picture 33,000 people living there, within the space of one city block. That was Kowloon Walled City, once considered the densest settlement on earth.  "A huge monstrosity of buildings"  Before it was demolished twenty years ago, photographer Greg Girard spent years with collaborator Ian Lambot documenting this unique Hong Kong phenomenon, and remembers being amazed when he first saw it.  "It was a huge monstrosity of buildings," recalls Girard. "It didn't look like anything else."  After all, the Walled City was a kind of historical accident. A former Qing dynasty fortress, it never fully came under the regulation of the British colonial government in Hong Kong. As a result, its residents were free to build their dwellings as they wished, ignoring safety codes.  "Quite often houses were built by building onto the next building, punching out walls to use their staircases," said Girard. "A lot of them didn't have access to air or open space, because they were enclosed in the center of the structure."  Deep within the building's darkness, a variety of small businesses flourished.  "The places that stuck out were the meat factories," says Girard. "There were pig carcasses laying splayed out on the floor; they'd burn the hair off with a blowtorch, it was all pretty open and of course there were no health laws governing the place."  But despite the City's wild appearance, the photographer found that the people inside lived just like people anywhere else.  "People were doing very ordinary things," he says. "It's just that all these ordinary things were happening in an extraordinary place."  An ingenious community  The complexity of the Walled City also fascinated local architect Aaron Tan, now the director of Hong Kong firm Research Architecture Design. A graduate student then, he wrote his thesis on the Walled City as it was being torn down.  "I was fascinatedit was like a piece of machinery that worked very well. The demolition was like taking the machine apartthe first time you could see what was inside.  "It was a really humbling process for me as a designerwhen we met this Walled City, we started to see that people could be more intelligent than us, the designersthat they could think of ways to solve problems that are outside the traditional academic world."  Tan was especially impressed by Kowloon Walled City's water system. To support its dense population, residents dug extra wells and built thousands of pipes that twisted through the building. But since pumping water to the City's roof tanks required plenty of power, the people would take turns conserving electricity so that water could be shared successfully.  "It revealed the community insidethat no matter the challenges, they would find some intelligent way to solve it," says Tan.  Despite the ingenuity of the Walled City, by 1994 it was completely torn down by the city government, which was eager to replace the chaotic and unregulated community with a public park.  "Seeing the Walled City fall into disuse was sort of melancholic," says Girard. "Every city realizes too late to start caring about their architectural heritageit's a mistake that gets repeated everywhere. By the time you start caring about it, it's too late to save it."  Today, visitors to the site of the old Walled City will find a placid garden with swaying trees and cloudy ponds. In the park there is a small museum in honor of Kowloon Walled City. But when you look to the sky and imagine the colossus of Hong Kong life that once stood, it's easy to see that something significant has been lost.  CNN Travel: Why we love the Kowloon City neighborhood  The City is not dead  Even today, the City's legacy lives on. A walled neighborhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film "Batman Begins" was based on Kowloon Walled City. The City is even a level in the video game "Call of Duty: Black Ops."  Because of the continued interest, Greg Girard is working with his fellow Kowloon Walled City photographer Ian Lambot to finish a new book of their stunning photographs, entitled "City of Darkness: Revisited."  "You don't want to romanticize a slum, you know. Because it was that. But it was much more than that. The Walled City was a kind of architectural touchstone in terms of what a city can beunplanned, self-generated, unregulated. It was vital and vibrant and every part of it was being used."  Tan believes the spirit of the Walled City continues to pulse through the heart of Hong Kong itself.  "Go to The Peak and look down upon this amazing collection of buildings coming togetherit's almost like a blown up version of the Walled City, right? Each building is related to the next building. New programs evolve because of the connections."  This organic chaos, he says, has been an inspiration for his own work.  "Many architects and urban planners like control," he says. "But people like to get lost in the city. In my design process, I always consciously try to allow accidents, to allow others to participate, to surprise me."

Since when were a bunch of kids so interested in ancient history?  Whole families were pressed up against the railings at Largo Argentina, the square in Rome, craning their heads toward ... a hole in the ground.  Rome is full of holes in the ground, many of them historically significant, but this one was extra special.  It contained the remains of the theater and temple where Julius Caesar was assassinated.  But the kids weren't there for the ancient general-turned-emperor, murdered by treacherous senators in 44 BC.  They were there for the cats.  Rome's kitty ruins  Rome's noble ruins are a favorite haunt of feral cats.  The "gatti di Roma" star on postcards and wall calendars sold all over the city.  The ruins at Largo Argentina host an open-air cat sanctuary that's more than just a good show for visiting and local children.  The city's strays have been fed and watered at the site almost since it was first excavated in the 1920s.  The 1990s brought an injection of funds into the Torre Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary, money that allowed more cats to be trapped, neutered and returned to their colony.  Now, thousands of sterilizations are carried out each yeararound 30,000 and counting since 2000.  More: How to Travel with Your Dog  Japan's cat islands  That's right: islands.  Plural.  Tashirojima in Miyagi Prefecture, is Japan's best-known feline isle.  It usually goes by the name Cat Island.  Dogs have been barred from Tashirojima for as long as anyone can remember.  The island's cats vastly outnumber its human population.  Tashirojima's furry inhabitants are well cared for by local fishermen, who hope to ensure a good catch by leaving offerings at a cat shrine.  The island's most prominent structure, the Manga building and campsite, is embellished with a pair of pointy ears, in tribute to the island's lucky charms.  Japan's other cat island, Ainoshima, is a little more remote, a 20-minute ferry ride from Shingu port in Fukuoka.  A scrum of happy cats hangs out by the port, waiting for the next fishing boat or ferry to dock.  In fact, the island represents a doubly incentive for the catsrugged Ainoshima is also a popular birdwatching site.

Houtong once sat on top of Taiwan's largest coal mine.  When the mine closed in the 1990s, the town's population dwindled.  Then some new, furry residents arrived.  The Houtong Coal Mine Ecological Park (Houtong Road, Ruifang District, New Taipei City; +886 2 2497 4143) was established to showcase the mining heritage of the town and surrounding hills.  But visitors mostly come to photograph the 120 or so playful cats, who laze around the Cat Village and soak up the fussand inevitable treats.

Established in 2008, KAPSA is a voluntary organization run by locals and expats that traps stray cats.  KAPSA neuters them and provides basic healthcare, then releases them.  Animal loving visitors regularly give up vacation time to help out and share their experiences and photos on the Friends of KAPSA Facebook group.  When tourists disappear for the winter, KAPSA feeds and cares for more than a thousand cats, relying on donations to fund its operations.  Eager photographers can snap cats all over Kalkan, snoozing on hammam towels, curled up in fruit bowls or enjoying the air conditioning in the resort's stores.  Several often gather by the old mosque, close to Kalkan's beach, to pose for the cameras.  Hemingway's cats, Florida Keys  Ernest Hemingway earned a reputation as one of the world's great drinkers.  There's even a statue of him propping up the bar in El Floridita, Havana.  Less known is that Hemingway was also a cat lover.  The Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum (907 Whitehead St., Key West, Florida; +1 305 294 1136), Key West, is stuffed with antique furniture and fine art.  In some rooms, it feels like the great author has just stepped out, even though he died in 1961.  And his 1850s house is still a hometo a colony of polydactyl, or six-toed, cats.  Hemingway was given a white six-toed cat named Snowball in the 1930s. Some of Snowball's descendents are among the 50 or so furry residents of the historic home today.

Google has revealed a prototype of its latest driverless carand this one doesn't even have a steering wheel.  The car will only have a stop and go button. No steering wheel. No pedals.  Unlike Google's previous self-driving vehicles, which have been based on conventional cars adapted to navigate around without a driver, this model has been designed from scratch.  "They won't have a steering wheel, accelerator pedal, or brake pedal... because they don't need them," Google said in a statement.  The car can carry two passengers and has a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour.  Google says the car's most important feature is its safety.  "They have sensors that remove blind spots, and they can detect objects out to a distance of more than two football fields in all directions, which is especially helpful on busy streets with lots of intersections," the company said.  With its front designed to look like a friendly smiley face, the Google autonomous car is not just efficient and futuristic, but also cute to look at.  Google said it planned to build around 100 prototypes, which it will start testing in a few months.  The company started developing its self-driving cars in 2005, and is testing previous models across the U.S. They are expected to be available to buy by 2020.

 Baltimore Shortly after becoming the nation's 112th Supreme Court justice, Elena Kagan by tradition was presented with a silver cup, engraved with the names of those who preceded her in that particular seat. Speaking Tuesday evening before an audience at a synagogue here, Kagan recalled one name standing out in her mind: Louis Brandeis, the nation's first Jewish justice.  "His nomination was controversial, and it took some courage for the president to name him to the bench," she said. "He later faced prejudice on the bench. Justice (James Clark) McReynolds would turn his back on Justice Brandeis when he spoke from the bench, and refused to shake his hand or have his picture taken with him."  Ninety-five years and three justices removed in that seat she now occupies, Kagan said her Jewish heritage barely attracted attention when she was nominated last year. "There are three Jews on the court, but nobody talks about that. It doesn't matter, times have changed," she said.  Kagan addressed a mostly Jewish audience of Beth Tfiloh Congregation, celebrating its 90th anniversary. She was asked if her faith affected how she approaches certain cases, especially those involving religion.  A case the court will hear early next month involves the State Department's decision to currently list only Jerusalem as the place of birth on Israeli or Palestinian passports, deliberately leaving out the country name in that disputed region. An Israeli couple sued the government, and the issue is whether courts can intervene to overturn such executive and diplomatic decisions.  "I don't think the fact I'm Jewish will matter with respect to the Jerusalem passport case, and it shouldn't, " she said. "Anyone who comes before the court should expect impartial justice, and getting the same kind of treatment."  Kagan deflected suggestions the court's religious makeupthree Jews and six Catholicswould somehow undermine public confidence.  "It sometimes requires effort to put your feelings aside," she said. "We are all the sum of our experiences, but we (justices) all understand the role of the judge is to step back from any personal proclivities and look just at interpreting the law."  The 51-year-old justice noted her colleagues also share other things in common: all attended either Harvard or Yale law schools, and five, including Kagan, come from the New York City area.  The justice was introduced at the Baltimore event by Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Maryland, a longtime member of Beth Tfiloh. Cardin also sits on the Judiciary Committee, which held confirmation hearings for Kagan last year.  Kagan grew up in the west side of Manhattan, and describes her family's religious journey as "wandering Jews." "My mother never really found a rabbi she liked, so we joined several synagogues when I was growing up: Conservative, Reform, modern Orthodox."  The family settled on the Lincoln Square Synagogue, where Kagan was a pioneer of sorts, becoming the first girl to have a bat mitzvah at the Amsterdam Avenue facility. She was the one who insisted on it, after her older brother had his bar mitzvah.  "It was the great Jewish experience of my youth," she remembered. "It was a completely natural thing" to want to have a bat mitzvah. "I had to negotiate myself with Rabbi (Shlomo) Riskin," who had never before performed the coming-of-age rite with a 12-year-old girl.  Compromises were made at the modern Orthodox synagogue: her ceremony took place on a Friday night in May 1973, not the usual Saturday mornings boys enjoyed. The star student at her Jewish school read from the Book of Ruth.  "It was good, not great," she said of the ceremony. "It was not exactly what my brother had done, which is what I wanted. But the experience shaped my life, negotiating with Rabbi Riskin. It was a formative experience, and I guess I've always been a striver."  That drive led her to the job that she says "is now my life's work," a place she expects to stay for some time. Despite never having been a judge before, Kagan said the transition has been in some ways easier than she expected.  "Was I nervous, sure," she said of her first days on the bench. "But then I just starting speaking (during oral arguments) and I noticed, oh look, words are coming out of my mouth, and I think I'm making sense. I can do this."  Her colleagues too, she said, have been enormously supportive, and have even opened new worlds for her.  She recalled paying a courtesy call on Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, shortly after her nomination to the court by President Barack Obama in May 2010. Risch asked her about gun rights, and remarked she may not realize how important the issue is to some Americans, especially in his home state.  She admitted never having owned or fired a gun before. "But I told the senator if I was fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would go hunting with Justice Scalia."  And she has, joining her conservative colleague on an excursion to a Washington-area shooting range and on several hunting trips, until now never reported. Her host at the synagogue event was surprised.  "You're Jewish," deadpanned Rabbi Mitchell Wohlberg.  "Yeah, but it turns out, it's kind of fun," said Kagan, laughing.

London British girl Madeleine McCann, who vanished during a 2007 family vacation in Portugal, may still be alive, UK authorities said Wednesday.  Madeleine was a few days shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz as her parents dined in a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Despite a huge police investigation, massive coverage in the Portuguese and British media, and a public riveted on social media, she remains missing.  London's Metropolitan Police on Wednesday released a new image of the girl created in collaboration with the family that shows how Madeleine might look at age 9. Her ninth birthday is May 12.  Timeline of the case  An investigative review formed in May last year has been going through details from the case.  "As a result of evidence uncovered during the review, they now believe there is a possibility Madeleine is still alive and are appealing for anyone who is able to provide direct information as to her whereabouts to contact the team," police said in a statement, without disclosing any details on the possibility of new leads.  Investigators are combing through about 100,000 pages of information for more details, authorities said.  "The intention is to identify from that material investigative opportunities which we will then present to the Portuguese authorities who retain primacy for the investigation," police said. "Officers have so far identified around 195 such opportunities within the historic material, and are also developing what they believe to be genuinely new material."  Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading a team of more than 35 officers focused on the McCann case, said they "will continue to put Madeleine McCann at the heart of everything we do." Redwood has visited Portugal seven times since the disappearance and has regular contact with the girl's parents.  The investigation is split equally down two linesone assuming that Madeleine is dead, the other that she is alive, police said.  Since her disappearance, her parents have appealed for help and said there's a chance she may still be alive. Frequent reports of sightings of her in various parts of the world have sparked frenzies. Last year, a report of a girl bearing a resemblance to the child created a spike on social media.  A spokesman for the girl's parents said the latest report is no more credible than other tips that proved incorrect over the years.  Portuguese investigators closed the case in July 2008.  
 The Syrian government has been mounting a campaign to boost vaccination among children in Syria after at least 20 suspected cases of polio were reportedfrom government and opposition sourcesnear the eastern city of Deir Ezzor.  Though the cases will not be confirmed for about a week, "as far as everyone is concerned, they're treating this like polio," said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization's assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration.  WHO personnel were working with government health officials in Syria as well as surrounding countries "to stop what's circulating in Syria and make sure it doesn't spread," he told CNN Thursday in a telephone interview. But, given the massive refugee flows, "it's going to be a tough one," he said.  Wild poliovirus was last reported in Syria in 1999. The highly infectious viral disease primarily affects young children. Initial symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, limb pain and, in a small number of cases, paralysis.  It can be prevented through immunization, but there is no cure. The incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99% since 1988. It remains endemic in three countries, Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan, down from more than 125 countries in 1988.  The director of the National Immunization Program at the Ministry of Health, Dr. Nidal Abu Rashid, said the campaign also seeks to prevent measles cases, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency.  Public health can be among the first casualties of war, as resources can be diverted away from ensuring clean water supplies and intact sewer lines.  WHO said last week that it had received the reports of a cluster of cases of acute flaccid paralysis, which is defined as sudden onset of weakness and floppiness in any part of a child's body or paralysis in any person in whom polio is suspected as the cause.  Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing civil war, the polio vaccination effort will be helped by the fact that Syria had high rates of vaccination coverage among its populace prior to the current conflict, Aylward predicted.  In an address Friday to the U.N. Security Council, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief cited the outbreak as an example of the privations endured by the Syrians and the risks they face.  Diseases, including those easily preventable by basic hygiene and vaccination, are spreading "at an alarming rate," said Valerie Amos. In addition, reports of malnutrition have soared, and people suffering from chronic illnesses, such as cancer and diabetes, are dying for lack of access to treatment, she said.  She credited the U.N.'s World Food Programme with scaling up its operations with the goal of reaching 4 million people per monthhalf of them in opposition-held or contested areas of Syria.  Still, she said, "the humanitarian response in Syria remains severely insufficient compared to growing needs."  Aid workers cannot reach some 2.5 million people in the country, she added.  "All humanitarian staff missions and convoys continue to require written approval," she said, citing as "unacceptable" and "unpredictable" the government's processing of visas for U.N. and non-governmental staff members. More than 100 such visas are pending, many are limited to a single entry and many of those that are issued are for insufficient durations, she said.  "There is simply no reason why humanitarian staff, whose only interest is to help those in desperate need, have not been granted visas to scale up our operations," she said.  In response, Syria's permanent representative to the United Nations acknowledged to reporters in New York that the country is facing grave humanitarian problems, but accused Amos of having failed to properly apportion blame.  "She should know and say what are the root causes," Bashar Jaafari told reporters, citing neighborhoods that are "under siege by the Syrian Army because there are armed groups in these neighborhoods taking civilians as human shields."  Jaafari said his country is "a victim of interference by some member states into its domestic affairs."  Regarding the issuance of visas, he said, "We are issuing too many visas to too many people; we are a sovereign nation, like any other nation; we have our own reasons sometimes to deny a visa to this or that individual."  Jaafari said Damascus has extended visas to hundreds of people working for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which is led by Amos. "Any minimal cases here and there" of problems "wouldn't affect the overall picture of our cooperation with OCHA," he said.  In Syria, opposition activists blamed the war for more than 100 deaths Friday in a series of incidents.  A car bomb erupted in front of a mosque in the Damascus suburb of Wadi Barada, killing at least 44 people and wounding more than 200, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.  Other attacks resulted in 33 deaths in Daraa; 11 in Hama; 11 in Deir Ezzor; five in Latakia; three in Homs; three in Aleppo; and three in Idlib, the LCC said.  Syrian state television reported that the military ambushed and killed more than 50 "terrorists" in al-Otaiba, a town in the suburbs of Damascus. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the number of rebel dead at 20.  Amid accusations by government and opposition forces that each side has used chemical weapons, the Syrian government continued this week to comply with its agreement to rid the country of its stores of such arms, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said.  On Thursday, the OPCW said its inspectors had visited the 19th of 23 chemical weapons sites disclosed by Damascus.  President Bashar al-Assad on Thursday thanked workers at the ministries of electricity and petroleum for restoring services a day after much of the country was plunged into darkness by what the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said was sabotage of a gas pipeline.  According to the United Nations, more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict, which began in March 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters.

Environmentalists in Vietnam were ebullient this week after remote cameras in a forest reserve snapped pictures of a live saola, one of the rarest large mammals on Earth.  At most a few hundredand as few as a couple dozenof the animals are thought to exist. Because of that rarity and its elusiveness, the saola is dubbed the "Asian unicorn." That moniker comes despite the fact it has two closely spaced parallel horns.  "These are the most important wild animal photographs taken in Asia, and perhaps the world, in at least the past decade," said William Robichaud, coordinator of the Saola Working Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission, in a World Wildlife Fund press release.  Scientists discover new species in Australian rainforest  "This is an historic moment in Vietnam's efforts to protect our extraordinary biodiversity," Dang Dinh Nguyen, deputy head of the country's Quang Nam Forest Protection Department, said in the release.  The picture of the animal was taken in September in a reserve in the Central Annamite Mountains and announced by the WWF on Tuesday.  441 species discovered in Amazon since 2010  Van Ngoc Thinh, WWF-Vietnam's country director, called the picture "a breath-taking discovery."  "When our team first looked at the photos we couldn't believe our eyes. Saola are the holy grail for Southeast Asian conservationists," Van said in a press release.  The saola, which is a relative of cattle but looks like an antelope, was first discovered in 1992 in forests along the Vietnam-Laos border. A WWF survey team found a skull of the animal in a hunter's home. In Vietnam, a saola was last seen in the wild in 1998. In Laos, a remote camera snapped a picture of one in the wild in 1999. And in 2010, Laotian villagers captured a saola that died before word got to researchers.  Olinguito: The newest rare mammal species  There are no saola in captivity.  Environmentalists said Wednesday the pictures show that efforts to save the saola are working.  "Saola are caught in wire snares set by hunters to catch other animals, such as deer and civets, which are largely destined for the lucrative illegal wildlife trade," Van said in the WWF release. "Since 2011, forest guard patrols ... have removed more than 30,000 snares from this critical saola habitat and destroyed more than 600 illegal hunters' camps."

 A Seattle-area couple is in custody for allegedly holding captive and torturing the man's 13-year-old brother for three monthsincluding driving a nail through the boy's hand and keeping him in a cellar for days without food, the prosecutor said Wednesday.  Brandon Gunn, 27, and his wife Viviana, 34, are in the Kitsap County Jail outside Seattle on $500,000 bail each, charged with kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and four counts of assault, county prosecutor Cami Lewis said.  Brandon's brother is from Atlanta and went in May to stay with his brother for the summer, Kitsap County Deputy Sheriff Scott Wilson said.  "We've been crying for days," the teen's aunt, Marsha Thomas-Jones, told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB. "My sister is devastated."  The alleged torture began as early as May 1 and lasted until the teenager escaped from his brother's cellar two weeks ago, according to the prosecutor's complaint, filed Tuesday.  Thomas-Jones said the family suspected something was wrong months ago when communication ceased, and it tried unsuccessfully to get law enforcement involved early, WSB reported.  The attorney for Brandon Gunn, Michele Taylor, was given the case only Wednesday and has not received any discovery documents, said her paralegal, Samantha Badkin. She said they don't expect to speak to their client until at least next Tuesday.  A voicemail message for Viviana Gunn's attorney, Jeniece Lacross, was not returned late Wednesday.  According to the probable cause certificate filed Monday by the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office, the boy was sent to the Gunns' garage where he was duct-taped to a chair with tape over his eyes and mouth, then beaten in the head, torso and legs with a baseball bat and metal bars, losing consciousness at times.  Another time, the couple put the boy's hand in a bench vise, tightened it, and drove a nail through the his hand with a hammer, the certificate says. The boy said that time, he could see them doing it.  The Gunns duct-taped his hands and hung him from a rafter in the garage, then beat him; they also stapled his right palm with a construction stapler, heated a knife and cut him with it, according to the certificate.  The couple forced the boy to stay naked in a portable dog kennel twice for two to three days at a time, with no food or water, the certificate says. He also was forced to stay in the dark cellar for four days, and when he escaped to get food, he was punished by being beaten with a baseball bat, it says.  The boy said the couple called the abuse "punishment sessions" for not doing chores or breaking household rules, and that the "sessions" would last for two to three hours, according to Deputy Sheriff Wilson.  When the boy escaped, he had been duct-taped but managed to escape by moving his hands in front of him, peeling the tape off his mouth, then chewing through the tape binding his hands, Wilson said. He forced open the cellar door and then lived on the streets for two weeks, stealing food when he could, Wilson said.  He was sleeping in a bus shelter on a Navy housing complex last Friday night when two Navy security officers found the boy and saw his injuries, Wilson said. They immediately sent the boy to a hospital where detectives interviewed him.  They saw injuries to the boy's head, face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, legs, hands and feet, ranging from fresh open wounds to wounds that were in the process of healing, the certificate of probable cause says.  The doctor also found a broken piece of metal in the boy's hand, possibly from the nail.  "In the first six hours they were able to develop enough probable cause for the arrest of the brother and the brother's wife," Wilson said. "they were arrested at 7 a.m. (Saturday) at their house."  When detectives interviewed Brandon Gunn, he denied abusing the boy, saying only that he gave him a "whooping" with a belt on his backside a few times.  Detectives searched the home and found blood stains on the wall, door, bench vise, baseball bat and chair, the certificate of probable cause says. They also found the dog kennel and staple gun, and a strong smell of urine in a corner of the cellar where the boy said he was forced to urinate, it says.  The boy is out of the hospital and living with a foster family, Wilson said.  The Gunns' next court appearance is scheduled for September 10 in Kitsap County District Court, said Lewis, the prosecutor.  People held captive in Philadelphia

Fifteen people have now died after consuming cantaloupe contaminated with the listeria monocytogenes bacteria, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.  At least 84 people in 19 states have become ill with the bacteria, the agency said. And the number of illnesses could still grow, added the CDC, citing reporting lags and how the disease can develop slowly in some people.  On Tuesday, the CDC was reporting 13 deaths and 72 illnesses in what was already then the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998.  Five people have died in New Mexico from eating the tainted cantaloupes, the CDC said. Three people died in Colorado, two in Texas and one each in Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma.  Illnesses have also been reported in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.  What you need to know about Listeria  Most of those who fell ill are more than 60 years old, the CDC said. Doctors also are closely monitoring the pregnancies of two women who ate contaminated cantaloupe, with the agency noting that listeriosis can cause miscarriages and stillbirths.  Older adults and people with compromised immune systems are also especially susceptible.  Public health investigators have traced the source of the bacteria to a farm in Granada, Colorado.  Food Poisoning 101  The grower, Jensen Farms, issued a recall for its Rocky Ford-brand cantaloupes on September 14. By now, the cantaloupes should all be off store shelves, the CDC said.  The agency warned that people should not eat Rocky Ford cantaloupes, even if they have eaten part of one and have not yet fallen ill. It also said that consumers should be wary of eating any cantaloupes if they don't know where they came from.  How to keep your food safe  
 The AMC series "Mad Men" has been honored for its sharp writing, polished acting and engaging portrayal of life at a New York advertising agency in the early 1960s.  "Mad Men" has gotten attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers.  It has also been much noticed for something else: its fashion sense.  The series, which features all the looks of that erathin-lapeled suits and skinny ties, crinoline-puffed dresses and pencil skirts, Peter Pan collars and subdued pinks and greenshas attracted attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. Banana Republic, which has placed "Mad Men"-inspired clothes in its window displays, is even offering a walk-on role for the winner of a contest.  "Mad Men," which returns for its third season Sunday, isn't the first Hollywood creation to influence fashion trends. For decades, movies and television shows have played a primary role in dictating people's fashion choices, whether they've been aware of it or not. Here are a few examples.  1. In the 1934 film "It Happened One Night," star Clark Gable took off his shirt and showed his bare chest, instead of the standard white undershirt. For decades, an urban legend has maintained that undershirt sales dropped up to 75 percent, not to recover until World War II. Though the mythbusting site Snopes.com says the truth is uncertain, it's testimony to the legend's strength that we're still talking about it 75 years later.  2. The 1967 film "Bonnie and Clyde," with its (somewhat idealized) Depression-era fashion, continues to inspire today's designers. Faye Dunaway's berets, scarves, trench coats, fitted cardigans and long pencil skirts were a hit at the time and remain so today.  3. "Annie Hall" boldly showed women that the masculine preppy look was attractive. Star Diane Keaton wore baggy pants, dress shirts, a vest and tie in the 1977 Woody Allen film. The film is said to have influenced a spike in tie sales for women.  4. "Saturday Night Fever" rejuvenated a fading disco craze in 1977 and told men it's OK to wear crotch-hugging pants, wide-open, chest-baring shirts and large medallion jewelry. John Travolta's white polyester suitlater bought by film critic Gene Siskel at auctionbecame a disco-era icon.  5. The 1983 film "Flashdance" made active wearlike a ripped sweatshirt off one shoulder, tight leggings and leg warmerssexy for women in the early 1980s. Actor Jennifer Beals is said to have cut the collar off a sweatshirt that had shrunk in order to get it over her head, according to the Internet Movie Database.  6. The 1980s TV series "Miami Vice," with its lightweight fabrics and pastel colors, proved a hit on television and in menswear departments. Star Don Johnson's signature lookT-shirt, suit jacket, linen pants and shoes worn socklesscould be seen all over the country. (He also popularized the unshaven, stubble-bearded look.)  7. "Sex and the City" trendsetter Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie, talked about her shoe addiction constantly during the HBO series, which ran from 1998 to 2004 and spawned a 2008 movie. Soon, stilettospaired with a thrown-together lookbecame something the cool crowd of viewers would follow, along with brands such as Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo.  8. A game show starting a fashion trend? It happened with "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," which featured host Regis Philbin sporting a monochromatic shirt-and-tie look. Later, he launched a line of shirts and ties in the Regis by Van Heusen collection.

Lech Walesa, the man who led Poland to freedom in its Cold War struggle with the Soviet Bloc, is refusing to apologize for suggesting gay Polish politicians should "sit behind a wall" in the country's parliament.  The former Polish president and Nobel Peace Prize winner provoked uproar in Poland when he told a television reporter Friday night that as a minority, gays have no right to a prominent position in politics, and should sit perhaps at the rear of parliament of or even "behind a wall."  He said that gays have little significance as a minority, and therefore have to "adjust to smaller things."  A devout Catholic and father of eight children, Walesa now says he has nothing to apologize for despite a mountain of criticism heaped upon a man who was once venerated as a champion of Polish liberty. He stressed he did not "feel homophobic."  "I will not apologize to anyone," the former president said in an interview Monday. "All I said (was) that minorities, which I respect, should not have the right to impose their views on the majority. I think most of Poland is behind me."  Since his comments went nationwide, Walesa has been on the receiving end of furious criticism.  "Why does Lech want me to sit in the back row?" asked Robert Biedron, a member of parliament from the opposition Palikot Movement and Poland's first openly gay politician. "If we accept the rules proposed by Lech Walesa then where would blacks sit? They are also a minority. And what about the disabled?"  Others have called for called for Walesa to return his Nobel prize, while the Committee for the Defense Against Sects and Violence filed a formal complaint with prosecutors in Walesa's hometown of Gdansk, accusing him of promoting a "propaganda of hate against a sexual minority."  Along with damaging his reputation, the controversy could also have a painful effect on Walesa's career.  Long retired from domestic politics, he now earns his money from the international lecture circuit, talking about democracy and the fight against communism. But with his comments on gays making headlines around the world, the Polish press has speculated that invitations to speak may soon dry up.  Walesa, the shipyard worker who went on to inspire the Solidarity trade union in Poland, was awarded the Nobel Peace Price in 1983. He helped form the first non-communist government in the Soviet bloc in 1989 and was later elected president of Poland.  
 Damascus, Syria North Korea requested permission from Iraq this week to fly a plane through its airspace to Syria, an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told CNN on Friday.  Al-Maliki rejected the request out of suspicion the plane would be carrying weapons, said adviser Ali al-Mousawi.  The prime minister talked by phone with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Friday afternoon, officials said.  Biden asked Iraq for help in stopping weapons from reaching Syria, according to a statement released by his office, and stressed to the Iraqi prime minister "the need to prevent any state from taking advantage of Iraq's territory or airspace to send weapons to Syria."  Al-Maliki "expressed the Iraqi government's discomfort with some informal U.S parties of stirring suspicions about Iraq's position toward the Syrian crisis," and that Iraq has held a "firm position in rejecting any weapon supplies or violent activity over Iraq's territories or its airspaces," according to a release from his office.  "Al-Maliki reiterated the position of the Iraqi government based on the need to find a peaceful political solution for the Syrian crisis and its rejection to supply ammunitions to any party involved in the Syrian conflicts," the release said.  Opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's rule are concerned about the shuttling of arms to his government by entities such as Iran. Iraq borders Syria and Iran.  Al-Assad magazine interview  Earlier, Syria's besieged president slammed the rebels battling his government forces, but said the "door to dialogue is open."  "Dialogue with the opposition is the only way out to address the crisis," al-Assad said in a magazine interview published Friday.  The cries for freedom and democracy that spread across the Arab world last year also reached Syria. That set the wheels in motion for a standoff that morphed into a civil war between the al-Assad government and a burgeoning rebel movement.  More than 26,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the one-and-half-year-long conflict, according to opposition activists.  Al-Assad, who blames the violence on terror groups, told Egypt's Al-Ahram al-Arabi magazine that "armed men are engaged in terrorism against all of the state's institutions."  "They have no support in the society. Rather, they have harmed the interests of the people by targeting the infrastructure that serves the people and killing innocent Syrians. Ultimately, they will not emerge victorious," he said.  He said backers of these forces "think the only solution is through a Libyan scenario." That's a reference to rebel forces, with foreign backing, toppling Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and his government.  "But a decisive end (to the crisis) will take some time, of course. However, the door to dialogue is open and we have offered several initiatives for amnesty for all of those who put down their arms in order to encourage dialogue," al-Assad said.  Libyan fighting in Syria symbolizes fears  The president took jabs at Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatarall supporters of the opposition.  "They suddenly saw money in their hands after a long period of poverty and think they can change (the role of) history and geography, and play a regional role," al-Assad said, referring to Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  Before the Syrian conflict started last year, Saudi Arabia served only as a "mediator with the West that does not appreciate the axis of resistance against Zionism advocated by Syria," the president said.  "Let me correct a prevalent idea that Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt are the triangular axis of stability in the region. This is not true. It has always been, and will remain, Syria, Iraq and Egypt," he said.  As for Qatar, it "uses the power of money and revolves in the orbit of the West by providing weapons and money to terrorists to repeat the Libyan scenario," al-Assad said. And Turkey, he said, has "lost a lot" by taking its stance on Syria.  "They are unconcerned about the interests of its people, focusing solely on its ambitions that include the new Ottoman Empire," he said.  Here's a roundup of other developments in Syria's conflict:  Mass grave, massacres reported in Damascus area  Twenty-five "bound and blindfolded" bodies were found in a mass grave in the al-Qadam area of Damascus Friday, Syria's state news agency said. Authorities blamed the deaths on "armed terrorist groups."  The government also said its armed forces "killed a number of terrorists" in the Damascus area town of Beit Jen.  The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said regime forces conducted a "massacre" in the suburb of Buwaida. Seventeen people were stabbed to death after soldiers stormed the area, it said.  The LCC said the 17 were among 117 people killed across Syria on Friday. Forty-eight deaths occurred in the Damascus area. Seventeen people were killed in Aleppo and 15 each in Homs and Idlib provinces. Violence also raged in Daraa, Raqqa, Deir Ezzor, Latakia and Hama provinces.  Opposition figures disappear upon arrival in Syria  Two members of the National Coordination Body for Democratic Changean opposition groupand a friend who came to pick them up disappeared shortly after leaving the airport in Damascus, the group said.  "The National Coordination Body's Exile Branch holds the kidnappers, whoever they be, completely responsibilityethically, legally, and politicallyfor any physical or mental harm done. We demand an explanation for why there has been no communication, whatever the motives and reasons. We demand they be immediately returned safely to their families," the NCB said in a statement.  Syrian state news blamed terrorists for kidnapping the men.  Help for Syrians  The U.N. refugee agency says it is making progress relocating Syrian refugees in Lebanon.  It is also working to enroll refugee children in Lebanese and Iraqi schools, the agency said Friday. Nearly 73,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon have registered or are awaiting registration with the United Nations. There are now more than 29,000 Syrians in Iraq.  A second Russian plane transporting 38 tons of food arrived in Damascus Friday, according to the Syrian Arab News Agency, which reported the arrival of a similar shipment Thursday.  Christians in Syria fear uncertain future  CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq reported from Baghdad and Nic Robertson reported from Damascus. Hamdi Alkhshali, Amir Ahmed and Joe Sterling contributed to this report from Atlanta.

(RollingStone.com)Where do lonely hearts go?  Rolling Stone: Who Is Sam Smith? A Quick Primer on the U.K. Soul Singer  British singer Sam Smith, 21, has written a dissertation on the question with his debut LP. Smitha gifted blue-eyed-soulster with Barry Gibb's flexible falsetto and Mark Ronson's ear for throwback groovesgot noticed last year for his vocals on house duo Disclosure's slow jam "Latch."  Rolling Stone: Sam Smith comes out, says debut is dedicated to unrequited love  With In the Lonely Hour's orchestral flourishes and focus on a single unrealized affair, it seems the baby-faced singer is being positioned as a male Adele. But while the album flirts with a few radiant moments, Smith's endless yearning isn't wrapped in as many irresistible packages.  Rolling Stone: Sam Smith dazzles in 'SNL' debut  He rolls deepest on the gospel-powered "Stay With Me"a spare track with a simple arrangement that matches its bare pleaand "Like I Can," a blissful groove that packs a Seventies rock-radio punch. Elsewhere, though he reaches for his upper register with the same eagerness that he grasps for love, his emo hopelessness is a flood drowning everything in sight.  The album's team of producers gives Smith a mostly blank canvas to showcase his vocals, providing room for soaring riffs over fingerpicked guitars on "Not in That Way" and "Leave Your Lover." But neither leaves as indelible a mark as Smith's lost love has left on his heart.  See the original story at RollingStone.com.

 Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released a family photo with their son Prince George, a week ahead of their official visit to New Zealand and Australia.  It is just the third official official release of photos of Prince George and shows him with his parents aged eight months at their home in Kensington Palace, London.  The Duke of Cambridge, the second in line to the throne, is pictured with his wife and son looking out of an open window. The smiling duchess, 32, is holding Prince George on her knee as he focuses his attention on the family pet Lupo, a black cocker spaniel pictured sitting on the duke's lap.  Catherine is wearing white, while William, 31, looks relaxed in a shirt with the sleeves rolled up. George sports a light blue jumper with his name written on it, over a white collar.  The picture was taken by photographer Jason Bell, who also took the official photos for Prince George's christening, last October.  The family will be in New Zealand and Australia from April 7 to 25 but it's unclear what opportunities the public in both countries will have to glimpse the youngest royal in person.  Announcing the royal couple's planned engagements earlier this month, the Prince's private secretary identified occasions at which the youngest royal might be present, but kept an element of suspense:  "George being just a little over eight-months-old by the time they travel, I'm sure you will appreciate that the couple will have to make a final decision on those moments much closer to the time."  Prince George's first official photo was taken by his maternal grandfather, Michael Middleton. It showed Prince William and Catherinethe latter holding Prince George swaddled in a white blanketon the lawn of her parents' home in Berkshire.  New Zealanders may be hoping their country provides the backdrop for an updated version of that photo during the royal tour, after all, Prince William was recorded taking his first steps on the lawn of Government House in Auckland on his first visit, in 1983.  Royal itinerary  The Duke last visited New Zealand after the devastating 2011 earthquake in Christchurch. On this trip, the royal couple will visit the city together and stop to remember the 185 people killed.  As well as being Prince George's first visit Down Under, his mother Catherine will be making her debut.  "There's no hiding the enthusiasm for the visit by both the Duke and the Duchess. The Duke, because he has been before; and the Duchess because she has never been to either country but has wanted to do so as long as she can remember," Kensington Palace said in its earlier announcement.  The pair may not always be in complete agreement on their trip, however.  Kensington Palace said the Duke and Duchess were "just a little competitive" and some of the events on the itinerary will pit husband against wife.  The royal couple will board separate Team NZ America's Cup yachts for some informal racing in Auckland and coach rival teams in "rippa" rugby, a non-contact version of Rugby Union, in the South Island city of Dunedin.  A century after the outbreak of World War I, the tour will also see William and Kate paying tribute to both countries' war dead and visiting military bases.  Their last day will be April 25ANZAC [Australian and New Zealand Army Corps] Day, which originally marked the landing of soldiers from both nations at Gallipoli, Turkey, in 1915. In the eight-month campaign fought there, 2,721 New Zealanders and 8,709 Australians died, before the allied forces withdrew. The day is now a tribute to those who have died in all conflicts.  The Duke and Duchess will plant a seed from a pine tree at the site of the battle at the Australian War Memorial in Australia's capital city, Canberra, before returning to London.

One of the many disturbing aspects of the NSA spying revelations is how much joy they have brought to the world's chronic violators of human rights and political freedoms.  On Thursday in Moscow, where former NSA contractor Edward Snowden awaits his asylum papers, a Russian court removed a major critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin from the Kremlin's list of worries, sentencing the charismatic opposition leader Alexei Navalny to five years in jail on theft charges. Amid intense anger at the verdict and fears that it would raise Navalny's profile, the court agreed on Friday to release him pending appeal.  The trial and the predictable verdict, as the European Union foreign affairs chief said, "raises serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in Russia." That's putting it mildly. Navatny is the most prominent, but just one in a long series of politically-motivated prosecutions in a country where the courts seldom make a move that displeases Putin.  Navalny was particularly worrisome to the Russian president. He had gained an enormous following by speaking out against corruption and cronyism, labeling Putin's United Russia "a party of swindlers and thieves" and using social media to help mobilize the president's critics. He had just announced he would run for mayor of Moscow. But, like other Putin opponents with any possible chance to loosen the president's complete hold on power, he will likely go to prison instead. Now that he's released, Navalny is considering whether to stay or withdraw from the race for mayor.  Meanwhile, Putin and his backers are having a field day. They claim it is Washington that leads the world in violating human rights, even as dozens of people who dared protest against Putin's rule face trial or languish in jail, in a country where a number of journalists who criticized the president have turned up dead under mysterious circumstances.  When Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once the wealthiest man in Russia, decided to turn his attention from business to politics, the tax authorities turned on him. He was sent to prison in Siberia, and when he became eligible for parole, the state filed another case, winning another conviction which extended his sentence.  Then there's the case of Sergei Magnitsky. The government auditor was sent to investigate the investment firm Heritage Capital, which was charged with tax evasion. When Magnitsky concluded the tax fraud was actually coming from the government side and became a whistleblower, naming a network of corrupt officials, he was accused of working for Heritage and thrown in jail, where he became ill, was denied medical treatment and died in 2009, when he was just 37. The United States responded with the Magnitsky Law, imposing sanctions on those involved in his death.  Death didn't save Magnitsky from Russia's courts, which found him guilty of tax fraud just last week.  Many others, including the performance group Pussy Riot, have seen even small scale political activism land them in jail.  For Putin, having Snowden in Russia creates many complications, but he has hardly managed to conceal his glee at having America's top critic under his protection. He has made it clear that he wants Snowden to refrain from harming U.S.-Russian relations, and as a former KGB spy himself, the Russian president would risk ridicule if he ventured too far in criticizing NSA actions.  Still, Putin derived visible satisfaction from having Snowden land in Russia's lap, armed with material to discredit the United States. Conflicted by the need to preserve a needed relationship with Washington while wanting to maximize the benefit of Snowden's presence, Putin did his best impression of a protector of human rights. Snowden and Wikileaks' Julian Assange, Putin said, consider themselves "human rights activist ... fighting for the spread information."  "Ask yourself," he said, affecting the pose of a defender of oppressed activists, "should you hand these people over so they will be put in prison?" The implied answer was of course not. How could Putin possibly help send a human rights activist to prison?!  The Kremlin's media apparatus, in what is undoubtedly an effort to give America a black eye and take away Washington's power to criticize Russia's abuses, launched a campaign to put Snowden on a pedestal with programs that tore apart the United States, while glorifying the former NSA contractor who drew the curtain on U.S. government surveillance.  After that carefully crafted media operation, America's voice in the Navalny case lost its edge. After the verdict, the U.S. ambassador wrote a tweet decrying the "apparent political motivations in this trial." But Russian democrats and human rights activists have a weaker supporter in America now.  Snowden's days in Hong Kong brought a similar reaction from China. That was particularly ironic, considering that no country on Earth has a more elaborate machine to monitor and manipulate what its citizens do online than does China, where the Communist Party also has complete control of the political system.  China Daily, the government mouthpiece, gloated "This is not the first time that U.S. government agencies' wrongdoing have aroused widespread public concern." This, from a state that, in the words of Human Rights Watch, "imposes sharp curbs on freedom of expression, association ... openly rejects judicial independence and press freedom; arbitrarily restricts and suppresses human rights defenders..."  Even if you agree with Snowden that the NSA spying is going too far, as I do, it's hard to argue with the negative impact Snowden's revelations have had on human rights activists in other countries. Today, dictators and authoritarian rulers are basking in a viscous moral relativism, feeling their abuses are somehow justified by criticism of America's spying.  There are, however, many meaningful differences between America's surveillance excesses and those of Russia, China and their ilk. The most important of all is that Russia and China's behavior is motivated by a desire to suppress internal dissent, to protect the people and the organizations in power.  Nobody believes that is Washington's motivation. The United States may have gone too far, or far adrift, in pursuit of national security, but its spying machine is not built to destroy domestic opposition to the government.  When people say, "the Americans are just as bad," they are not only clearly wrong, they are also hurting the cause of political and personal freedom around the globe.  Snowden's revelations are a legitimate subject for discussion and criticism. But advocates of Internet privacy, free expression and human rights should not allow abusive authoritarian regimes to use American actions as a cover for their egregious misdeeds.  
 President Barack Obama fought back and Republican challenger Mitt Romney mostly stood his ground in a bruising, argumentative debate three weeks before Election Day.  With a third and final debate to go, both candidates appeared likely to secure their standing in an already tight race that portends a cliffhanger presidential vote.  Read a version of this story in Arabic  On Wednesday, both campaigns will continue their focus on battleground states considered crucial to winning the White House.  Obama heads to Iowa and Ohio and Vice President Joe Biden campaigns in Colorado and Nevada, while Romney will go to Virginia and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan stops in Ohio.  Tuesday night saw Obama bring the desired energy sought by worried Democrats after the president's lackluster performance in the first encounter two weeks ago.  This time, a forceful Obama defended his policies and challenged Romney on shifting positions on key issues while arguing his Republican rival's proposals would favor the wealthy if elected on November 6.  Romney repeatedly attacked Obama's record, saying millions of unemployed people and a sluggish economic recovery showed the president's policies had failed.  Five things we learned from the second presidential debate  A CNN/ORC International poll indicated that 46% of respondents who watched the debate thought Obama won, compared to 39% for Romney. The result was within the survey's margin of error, and responses to other questions showed the overall impression was generally positive for both candidates.  After the first debate on October 3 in Denver, a similar poll showed Romney scored a solid victory in the eyes of more than 60% of respondents.  "Most improvedthat award goes to Barack Obama," CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said, comparing the president's performance on Tuesday to his previous showing. "I think he had a much stronger debate tonight."  Daily Beast's Andrew Sullivan, who called Obama's poll numbers after the first debate "devastating," predicted the president would come "kicking back in the polls" in coming days.  Erick Erickson, the conservative RedState.com blogger and CNN contributor, thought Romney won the debate based on "clear majorities outside the margin of error" in the CNN/ORC poll who thought Romney would be better for the country on economic issues.  Read the transcript of the debate or watch it on CNN.com  "In fact, while other areas of the debate may overshadow this point, Romney deftly dispatched Obama on his economic record," Erickson said, calling it "the one issue that matters."  An awkward phrase by Romney in addressing gender pay inequality was creating the most buzz around the debate.  Romney said when he was elected governor of Massachusetts, all the applicants for cabinet positions were men, so he sought out women applicants. "I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' and they brought us whole binders full of women."  Before the debate was over "binders full of women" had aTwitter hashtag, a series of memeson Tumblr, anda Facebook page with over more than 100,000 fans. The phrase was the third-fastest rising search on Google during the debate.  Both candidates walked the floor with microphones in hand at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, raising their voices at times and repeatedly challenging each other's points during the 90-plus minute debate that featured a town hall-style format.  Moderator Candy Crowley, the CNN chief political correspondent, tried in vain at times to prevent each candidate from going over allotted time, with Obama speaking for more than three minutes longer than Romney on the night.  Obama was on the attack from the start, but waited until his final answerwith no chance for Romney to respondto raise his opponent's controversial "47%" comments at a fundraiser in May.  In remarks made public by a secretly recorded video of the event, Romney described 47% of the country as people dependent on government aid who refused to take personal responsibility.  Analysis: Romney whiffs on some easy pitches  "Think about who he was talking about," Obama said, listing people on Social Security "who've worked all their lives," veterans "who've sacrificed for this country," students, soldiers and "people working hard every day."  The president said he wanted to fight for those people "because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds."  Earlier, Obama went after Romney's five-point economic plan that the GOP candidate repeated two times during the second debate, saying it really was a one-point plan "and that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules."  Romney shot back that "if you elect President Obama, you know what you're going to getyou're going to get a repeat of the last four years."  Over and over, Romney repeated what he called the failings of Obama's policies including rising federal deficits and debts, more than 20 million people unemployed and anemic economic growth.  "We don't have to settle for what we're going through," Romney said at one point. "We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks. We don't have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. We don't have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps. We don't have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work. We don't have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job."  Town hall format leads to close-quarter exchanges  Obama was "great as a speaker, but his policies don't work," Romney said. Attempting to rebut Obama's criticism of his own policies, Romney insisted he would prioritize middle class growth, saying "it's about how we can get the middle class of this country a bright and prosperous future."  However, Romney failed to provide further specifics of his tax policy, even when one audience member asked about unspecified deductions and loopholes the candidate says he will eliminate.  On a sensitive foreign policy topic, the candidates clashed at the front of the stage over the September 11 terrorist attack in Libya that killed four Americans, with Romney suggesting the Obama administration played politics by failing to immediately acknowledge what happened.  Obama shot back that the suggestion anyone in his administration would play politics on such an issue was "offensive." When Obama said he called it a terrorist attack shortly after it occurred, Romney challenged him, and Obama responded "check the transcript."  CNN Electoral Map  Crowley cut in to say both men were rightObama referred to terrorism shortly after the attack, but the administration took longer to fully explain what occurred.  Unlike the first presidential debate, the town hall-style format allowed audience members to ask the questions. Crowley, the first woman to serve as moderator of a presidential debate in 20 years, tried to get in as many questions as possible from the uncommitted voters in the hall, sometimes struggling to cut off the candidates as they tried to make points or argued with each other.  The first question came from a 20-year-old college student, worried about whether he'd be able to support himself after graduation.  "More debt and less jobs. I'm going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again," Romney said, addressing the first-time voter. "When you come out in 2014I presume I'm going to be presidentI'm going to make sure you get a job."  Test your knowledge with debate trivia  Later questions addressed immigration, with Romney saying Obama failed to deliver on a promise to pass a major immigration overhaul while the president said Romney backed conservative positions such as opposing a measure that gives some children of unregistered immigrants a path to legal status.  Obama repeated his past criticism that Romney's tax plan doesn't add up, saying "when he's asked how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close, he can't tell you."  "You're going to be paying for it," Obama said of middle class taxpayers. "You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch. Nobody who's looked at it that's serious actually believes it adds up."  Funniest tweets on the second presidential debate  Romney, meanwhile, repeatedly insisted his plan won't raise taxes for middle class Americans but also won't raise or lower the tax burden on the wealthy, in contrast to Obama's proposal to let tax rates on the top 2% of wage earners return to higher tax rates from the Clinton era.  The president needed a strong debate to try to blunt Romney's rise in the polls after their first showdown. The most recent CNN "poll of polls"an aggregate of the latest major surveysshowed Romney with a slight edge nationally at 48%-47%.  In the battleground states considered up-for-grabs, polls show Romney has narrowed Obama's lead or caught the president.  The Obama campaign conceded he had a bad night in the first debate and promised a more aggressive approach in New York. A third and final debate focusing on foreign policy will take place October 22 in Florida.  Polls show voters consider the economy to be the most important election issue.  Where they stand: The candidates and issues  Unemployment fell below 8% in September for the first time since the month Obama took office in 2009. However, continuing high unemployment and slow growth have made the president vulnerable.  Romney and his campaign have sought to frame the election as a referendum on Obama's presidency, citing joblessness, slow recovery from the recession and chronic federal deficits and debt as reasons to deny a second term.  For their part, Obama and Democrats have tried to make the election about competing visions for the future. They argue Republican proposals to repeal major legislation, such as health care and Wall Street reforms, while cutting government and expanding tax cuts without identifying additional revenue sources would stall a sluggish but steady recovery.

Washington It might not really matter if President Barack Obama made his case on Syria to the American people. He didn't really ask them for anything in his televised address but to sit tight and watch the graphic videos of chemical weapons on YouTube as the surprise diplomatic track he's now chosen plays out.  The question now for Americans on Syriarather than whether the United States should launch military strikes after the regime of Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons on his own peopleis who they think is a better negotiating partner for Obama: Congress or Vladimir Putin?  "All eyes are on the Russian presidentPresident Putin," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Wednesday. "We all know that he was former head of the KGB. We all know about the KGB. He is president of that very big country and we are all so grateful that even though relations aren't perfect with Russia they are OK."  All eyes turn to U.S.-Russia talks  There probably aren't many people in Washington who would use "OK" to describe Obama's relationship with Congress.  Whether getting on this diplomatic track was a good idea or not probably has a lot to do with how you view the president and his leadership style already.  It's a bit more complicated than a simple choice of who he'd rather negotiate with, but Obama essentially chose Putin.  A brief flirtation with Congress suggested lawmakers were more than willing to reject a president's request for the use of force for the first time in recent memory.  On the one hand, after going from an imminent strike to seeking congressional authorization to taking a diplomatic route, critics have described him as being about as indecisive as an American president can be.  On the other, the Russians and Syrians are at the negotiating table and Syria has promised to join the Chemical Weapons Convention. That's something he tangibly achieved without dropping bombs.  5 questions: Did Obama answer them?  How he got there was messy. That's the word his own staffer used.  "Messy is fine. Messy means progress," an administration official told CNN's John King as the diplomatic solution was presenting itself. Whether the solution actually pans out remains anyone's guess. But that's OK with most lawmakers, many of whom didn't really want to vote on Syria anyway.  Even an unsure diplomatic solution is better than a military one for war-weary members of Congress.  "We do have to keep in mind an imperfect application of the Russian proposal is better than anything we can accomplish through the (president's military plan)," said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-California, in a speech on the House floor on Wednesday.  Sen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who favored giving the president authority to launch military strikes, told CNN's Dana Bash that the president is making it hard for Congress to work with him on just about anything.  "The president just seems to be very uncomfortable with being commander in chief of this nation," Corker said, although he added that he hopes the new diplomatic track pans out.  "He just can't follow through," said Corker, who was clearly frustrated that the president hadn't made a stronger argument to the nation that when an American president draws a red line, no country should be able to cross it without repercussions.  Obama will need senators like Corker to work with him now that Syria has been paused on Capitol Hill. Given Americans' continued focus on the economy, this president may be judged more for how he handles the looming two-headed fiscal dragon of government funding and debt ceiling authority.  Those issues will fester over the next two weeks until government funding runs out October 1 and the debt limit is reached as soon as October 18.  On those matters, he's not going to get any help from Putin. He must figure out how to work with Congress.  
 A tractor-trailer clipped one bus carrying students back from a college visit and then struck another head-on, leaving three dead, Mississippi authorities said Tuesday.  A teacher, school bus driver and the driver of the big rig died in the Tuesday afternoon incident near Calhoun City, authorities said.  "I've been doing this for 41 years and this is the worst wreck with this number of people I've seen," said Calhoun County Sheriff Billy Gore. "It's troubling to see so many young kids so so frightened."  The school group was returning from a visit to the University of Mississippi, officials said.  Mitchell Diggs, a spokesman for the University of Mississippi, said the group from Ackerman High School in Choctaw County was in Oxford for a typical admissions visit for seniors.  The students later took a tour and had lunch before departing the campus around 1 p.m., Diggs said.  About 60 children were on the buses, and 10 were transported to area hospitals after the 2:30 p.m. collision, officials said. One patient was airlifted, Gore said. The rest suffered mostly bumps and bruises, he said.  The accident happened on state routes 8 and 9, which are combined for several miles.  Footage provided by CNN affiliate WMC in Memphis, Tennessee, showed the damaged bus on a narrow bridge. The truck continued a few hundred yards before coming to a stop.  Calhoun City is in north central Mississippi.  The investigation is continuing.  CNN's Craig Bell and Sara Pratley contributed to this report.

Gaza City, Gaza Terrace crowds are controlled by men wearing army fatigues and holding Kalashnikov rifles, players and press pray on the pitch at half-time and when the final whistle is blown, the trophy is handed to the winning captain by one of Israel's most wanted men.  Welcome to football, Gaza style.  More than 5,000 fans crammed into the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City for what is an increasingly rare occasion these days: a game of football.   The "Gaza Dialogue and Tolerance Cup final" between Al Shate (a mixed team of Hamas and Fatah members that represents the 80,000 strong Al Shate refugee camp) played Al Salah Islamic Association (a team aligned with Hamas) in a tight match in front of raucous fans who flew blue and yellow flags and fired off flames from lit cans of hairspray in support of their side.  However, as with most things in the Gaza Strip, war, politics and internal divisions are never far away.  The beautiful game is inordinately popular in the tiny strip of 1.5 million people. The Palestinian national football squad has no less than 15 players representing Gaza and over the past 50 years dozens of teams have flourished, each with its own affiliation to different political groups.  Even Hamas' Ismail Haniyehthe de facto Palestinian prime minister who is a high-profile fugitive from Israeli authoritieshas a soft spot for the game.   In his youth he was a talented, no-nonsense defender for Al Shate, his home neighborhood. To underline the importance of the match, designed to promote harmony between political factions, Haniyeh turned up to present the cup.  But since Hamas, a militant Islamist group, seized control of Gaza from Fatah in 2007, football has been brought to the brink of extinction.  Hamas did more than take over Gaza's political and economic apparatus. They also took over all of Gaza's top sports and football clubs.   "We as sports people want to remove sport from politics but politicians on both sides, Hamas and Fatah, play on this, they try to make politics come into sport," explained Ibraheem Abu Saleem, vice president of the Palestinian Football Association [PFA] and the man in charge of the game in Gaza.  "The main problem lies with Hamas. When Hamas hands back the clubs to their legal board of directors, sport will be running again in Gaza as in the West Bank."  Angered by the political intrusion in sport, the PFA, based in the West Bank, refused to organize a league until the teams were handed back. Hamas declined and the football league has been dormant ever since the putsch.   Instead the clubs have been left to organize their own small, increasingly irregular tournaments. The best players simply left for the West Bank, but since Israel's war in Gaza last winter, that exodus has been halted due to movement restrictions.  In comparison football in the Fatah-controlled West Bank is thriving. The league was non existent three years ago. Now Palestinians turn up in huge numbers to matches, sometimes attracting as many as 15,000 fans. Private businesses have poured money into sponsoring their favorite teams and a brand new stadium was built on the outskirts of East Jerusalem to host the Palestinian national team's first ever home international last year.  "Here in the West Bank we have two members of Hamas on the board. We have teams for Hamas, the PFLP [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]," said Jibril Rajoub, President of the PFA, a former National Security Advisor to Yasser Arafat and a leading member of Fatah recently elected to the Fatah Central Committee. "There is a wall here between politics and factionalism in sport [in the West Bank]. I think the same should happen in Gaza."  Back in Gaza, Al Shate and their non-aligned fans left the happier, securing a 2-0 victory. But for the players, stuck between Hamas and the PFA, it was bittersweet.   "The takeover of the clubs is the main reason for us not having any competition and I want Hamas to give the clubs back," agreed Hamada Shbair, the winning captain of Al Shate and a Palestinian international who hasn't played for the national team since 2008 because of Israeli and Egyptian travel restrictions.  Shbair celebrated along with thousands of fans who carried their cup from the stadium back to the camp in procession. It was the first silverware in a quarter of a century for Al Shate, who have so far escaped the Hamas takeover.   But Shbair used the victory to make his views known to Haniyeh during the presentation of the cup. "I told him: 'You used to be a player, please solve this problem of the players quickly.' He replied: 'I hope so, Inshallah (God willing).'"  Gaza's football-mad population may have to savour Al Shate's victorious cup campaign for a while yet as no one knows when, or even if, the next competition will take place. But for Shbair, victory has sent a powerful message to his people.   "The Beach Camp [Al Shate] is very crowded, 80,000 people, and we wanted this team to make people happy after the war and the martyrs and the siege," he said. "But this club is also open to all people in Gaza. So it is a victory for moderation."  
 Washington Federal prosecutors dropped the remaining charges against former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards on Wednesday, less than two weeks after his corruption trial ended in an acquittal and mistrial.  The Justice Department had accused Edwards of using nearly $1 million in illegal campaign contributions to keep his pregnant mistress under wraps as he mounted a second presidential bid in 2008. But after more than 50 hours of deliberation, a North Carolina jury acquitted him on one of the six counts against him and deadlocked on the other five.  Lanny Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said prosecutors respect the judgment of the jury and would not bring the case to trial again.  "We knew that this caselike all campaign finance caseswould be challenging," Breuer said in a written statement on the decision. "But it is our duty to bring hard cases when we believe that the facts and the law support charging a candidate for high office with a crime."  Overheard on CNN.com: 'Being a slimy dirtbag doesn't equal being a criminal'  Edwards' lawyers said in a statement, "We are confident that the outcome of any new trial would have been the same."  "While John has repeatedly admitted to his sins, he has also consistently asserted, as we demonstrated at the trial, that he did not violate any campaign law nor even imagined that any campaign laws could apply," they said.  Edwards, 61, won a U.S. Senate seat from North Carolina in 1998. He ran for president in 2004, when he ended up as the Democrats' nominee for vice president, and again in 2008, when he dropped out of the reace after a poor showing in the early primaries.  Jurors: Evidence elusive in Edwards case  In August 2008, he admitted to an affair with onetime campaign videographer Rielle Hunter, but denied paternity of the daughter she had given birth to six months earlier. He eventually acknowledged paternity, and after the May 31 mistrial, he talked about "my precious Quinn, who I love more than any of you can ever imagine."  Prosecutors argued that Edwards took $925,000 from two high-powered donors to pay for Hunter's living and medical expenses, travel and other costs to keep her out of sight while he sought the presidencycontributions that amounted to illegal, undisclosed campaign donations. Former Edwards aide Andrew Young testified that he allowed Hunter to move in with him and his wife at Edwards' request after newspapers began looking into a possible affair within the Edwards campaign.  Edwards' lawyers argued he was guilty of being a bad husband to his wife, Elizabeth, who died of cancer in 2010, but had committed no crime. They also told jurors that Young, the government's star witness, used the contributions for his own gain.  Edwards charges: The rundown  "As we stated in our motions and arguments," his lawyers said Wednesday. "It should be addressed, if at all, by the Federal Election Commission, which our evidence showed seems to have agreed with our views on the law."

A grand jury has indicted Officer Randall Kerrick of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department on a charge of voluntary manslaughter in the September 14 shooting death of Jonathan Ferrell, according to a statement from state Attorney General Roy Cooper.  The grand jury heard evidence from the state Bureau of Investigation and the police department.  "With the strength of the evidence in this case, we're not surprised," Charles Monnett, an attorney for Ferrell's family, said about Monday's indictment.  "We're all pleased and happy that the process is beginning now and that there's an end in sight," he said. "It is the first step towards justice."  Ferrell's mother, Georgia, told CNN that she is prepared to wait as long as it takes for the case to wind its way through the justice system.  "I just feel like God's will will be done," she said.  The Charlotte, North Carolina, officer faced a second grand jury proceeding for the fatal shooting of Ferrell, an ex-college football player who was reportedly seeking assistance after a car accident.  Attorneys for Kerrick had denounced the prosecution's move to resubmit the case as unlawful and filed a motion to block it, but CNN affiliate News 14 Carolina reported the grand jury convened Monday morning.  A grand jury last week declined to indict Kerrick. Prosecutors said afterward the grand jury was composed of less than a full panel and vowed to send the case back.  According to a handwritten statement filed with the court, the first grand jury requested that the prosecutor submit a "bill of indictment to a lesser-included or related offense," but the state attorney general said he would resubmit the voluntary manslaughter charge.  Chris Chestnut, another attorney for Ferrell's family, described relatives as "shocked and devastated" by the first grand jury's ruling and said they were concerned a "miscarriage of justice is imminent."  Kerrick's attorneys, however, filed a motion Friday saying that any miscarriage was on the prosecution's part.  North Carolina law states that a grand jury can be made up of 12 to 18 members, the defense attorneys said. Thus, the prosecution's claim that it could go back to the grand jury because fewer than 18 members initially heard Kerrick's case was spurious, the motion said.  There was "nothing irregular or improper" about the grand jury that heard last week's case, the attorneys said in a statement.  The motion further alleged that Cooper's statement to the mediathat "This is not over"and his announcement that he would resubmit the case was a "wholly improper and blatant attempt to influence the (second) grand jury."  The defense reiterated its claim that the shooting, "while tragic, was justified under the circumstances presented to Officer Kerrick at the time," according to its statement.  "We have seen news clips and interviews stating the community should be 'outraged' at the return of a No True Bill of Indictment," the statement continued. "Those outraged have simply not heard all of the facts and hasten to a position. The true outrage of this community should be at the Attorney General's complete disregard of the original findings of our first grand jury."  Ferrell's family disagreed and issued a statement saying, "It appears that this motion was filed solely because Randall Kerrick's attorneys feel their client will be indicted once the full Grand Jury properly considers the evidence in this case when it convenes on Monday."  Attorneys for Ferrell's family on January 13 filed a civil lawsuit connected to his death. It targets the city of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe and Kerrick.  Kerrick shot an unarmed Ferrell, a 24-year-old ex-Florida A&M football player, after a womanhome alone with her 1-year-old childcalled 911 and reported someone was trying to break down her front door.  It was 2:35 a.m., and according to the lawsuit, the woman "does not understand that Jonathon may be injured and is in need of assistance and becomes frightened by his presence on her doorstep at such a late hour. She quickly closes the door, calls 911 for assistance and activates her home security system."  The woman told police Ferrell was "yelling for her to turn her alarm off" but never reported that Ferrell harmed her, made threatening statements, brandished a weapon or stole or vandalized her property, the lawsuit further alleges.  Police were dispatched, and Ferrell walked down the street to seek assistance elsewhere, according to the lawsuit.  Kerrick and two other officers arrived on the scene about 11 minutes after the 911 call, but Kerrick didn't speak with the woman, the lawsuit says. He instead tracked down Ferrell, who "never engages in any conduct which can be objectively reasonably interpreted as aggravated active aggression," according to the lawsuit.  "Defendant Kerrick, in direct violation of written police department regulations, fires 12 high-velocity bullets at Jonathon, striking him 10 times in the chest and arms," the lawsuit continues.  The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has called the shooting unlawful.  "The evidence revealed that Mr. Ferrell did advance on Officer Kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive," police said in a statement on September 14, the day of the shooting. "Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter."  Kerrick is free on $50,000 bond. His attorneys said in their statement Friday, "The citizens of Mecklenburg County by and through its grand jury have spoken. We pray that if this case is reheard by a second Grand Jury, the same conclusion will be reachedthat there is no probable cause to sustain an indictment for voluntary manslaughter against Officer Kerrick."

 Furious winds, giant waves and lack of sleep have all plagued the journey of Dilip Donde, the first Indian to attempt sailing solo round-the-world.  But, Donde remains unruffled: The Indian navy commander hand picked by the Navy for the voyage told CNN he had anticipated the violent weather in the rough far southern waters that skim the Antarctic coast.  "Sailing through the Southern Ocean, it was bound to happen some time so I was expecting it, though that does not make it any more comfortable," he said. Donde set off in August 2009 and is hoping to reach Mumbai by mid-May.  Donde has blogged throughout his voyage, giving regular updates as well as breaking down various sailing jargon for the uninitiated, like the famous Beaufort Scale.  The scale, is the international standard for determining wind speeds based on observable sea conditions, such as the height of waves. The scale goes from zero (no wind, glassy sea) to 12 (hurricane winds of over 100 kilometers per hour and "phenomenal" seas with waves that can sometimes reach above 17 meters).  And in the open ocean, often days away from help, these conditions also have a palpable psychological effect on a sailor's state of mind, according to Donde.  Sailors seek out the exhilaration that comes from sailing in strong windsjust under 40 km/h is idealbut it's a fine line, and as winds get stronger, delight can be tinged with anxiety which can quickly turn into terror.  While on a brief stop in South Africa, 42-year-old Donde spoke to CNN about his own state of mind while at sea and how rough weather can affect it.  CNN: What has your most extreme day on the boat like?  I was sailing through winds gusting to 55 knots (101 km/h) and waves of up to nine meters high in the "furious fifties" through the Tasman sea between Australia and New Zealand.  Rounding Cape Horn was bad too with steep breaking waves, strong currents and winds gusting to 45 knots (83 km/h) in the "roaring forties." And, yes, it was bitterly cold in those latitudes.  Do you ever worry that you could be seriously injured?  The biggest worry when the sea is violent, is always falling off the boat. When the sea is dangerous, visibility is low and you get thrashed around. The boat is on auto-pilot so if you fall it continues alone. I wear a harness.  When you are going through bad weather all your attention is focused on keeping the boat in one piece ... so there is not much time to start thinking about death. If the boat is alive, you're alive.  That probably helps in keeping your mind focused and [away from] worrying unnecessarily about other things that may or may not happen.  How scary does the weather get?  When you are in the middle of nowhere there is little choice: One has but to keep going if the weather turns nasty, so you just grin and bear it, keep the boat safe and tell yourself that "this too shall pass."  But I have probably experienced all the states of mind except for "I want my mummy!" (see factbox) although it has come pretty close.  Do sailors secretly hope for giant waves and storms, because it makes the experience more exciting?  I don't think so. While you do hope for good winds, you always hope that the sail will be as uneventful as possible. Any sailor will try his best to avoid a storm.  Why do sailors constantly push themselves in to extreme situations?  Probably there is an element of thrill; of understanding oneself and the elements better. With long-distance sailing, like everything else in life, you get a package deal of good days and bad days.  It is wonderful to sail on a good sunny day with a clear sky and moderate breeze, and one has to be ready to suffer the bad weather as and when it comes. The good days more than make up for the bad ones.

Prince William's wife, Catherine, plans to give birth to their first baby in the same hospital wing where her husband was born to Diana, Princess of Wales, almost 31 years ago, sources familiar with the plans said Wednesday.  The first details of the protocol surrounding the announcement of the birth were revealed as the Duchess of Cambridge enters the final weeks of her pregnancy.  The babywhich, regardless of gender, will be heir to the British throneis expected to arrive in mid-July.  According to sources familiar with the plans, the birth will take place in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London.  The first indication that the baby is on its way will be the announcement to the media that the Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor, royal sources told CNN.  The next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth.  It will be made in the form of a formal bulletin, signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace.  There, the notice will be placed on an easel on the palace forecourt, the royal sources said. This will be the first chance for the nation and those watching around the world to find out whether the new baby is a boy or a girl.  William and Catherine don't know the sex of their baby and want to keep the surprise until it's born, the royal sources said. William's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and other members of both families will be told of the birth before the public knows.  The next announcement will be that the Duchess of Cambridge and her baby are to be discharged from the hospital.  People are already laying bets on what the newest member of the royal family will be named.  Alexandra appears to be the favorite for a girl, with George the favored name for a boy, according to UK betting websites. Diana, Elizabeth and Victoria are also popular choices with punters.  The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William.  Paternity leave  The royal couple will probably present their baby to the world on the same doorstep where a proud Diana and Prince Charles showed off William in 1982.  It's not yet been disclosed where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth, the royal sources said.  William, who will turn 31 on Friday, is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the Ministry of Defence, the royal sources said. He will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot.  The revelation of the birth details may be cause for some anxiety, given the tragedy that followed Catherine's hospitalization late last year for acute morning sickness.  In that instance, a prank call by an Australian radio station to nursing staff at King Edward VII's Hospital, which sparked a media frenzy after details of Catherine's care were revealed, resulted in a nurse's suicide.  "We would appeal to all members of the media for an appropriate degree of sensitivity, dignity and privacy in their reporting," a royal source said.  "With the events of the King Edward Hospital still strong in our memories, we would expect any media covering the Duchess of Cambridge's hospitalization to ensure that the normal functions of the hospital are not impeded by any media presence."  Champagne on ice?  According to the Lindo Wing website, it has been offering private obstetric and neonatal care for mothers and babies since 1937.  The private wing operates alongside the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which is part of the National Health Service.  "Over the years, we have gained an international reputation for clinical excellence in both obstetric and neonatal medicine which has made us the choice for thousands of mothers. But what really sets us apart is the discreet, traditional, individualised service we provide," the Lindo Wing's online brochure says.  According to the prices listed, a stay in the Lindo Wing doesn't come cheap by comparison with National Health Service care, which is free at the point of delivery.  However, the mother can stay in a room with its own bath or private suite, with a range of facilities and services offered. Among them is "a comprehensive wine list should you wish to enjoy a glass of champagne and toast your baby's arrival."  The care package for the first 24 hours with a normal delivery starts at 4,965 ($7,777), with the price increasing for a larger room or suite, or if a forceps delivery or caesarean section is needed.  An additional night's stay costs 900 ($1,400) or more on top of that price.

 Renowned as much for her behavior out of the pool as her victories in it, Dawn Fraser is the greatest, and certainly most colorful female swimmer in Olympic history.  Fraser was the first woman ever to successfully defend an Olympic title.  The Australian won eight Olympic medals and was the first swimmer, either male or female, to win gold in the same event at three successive Olympiads.  The youngest of eight children, she suffered from chronic childhood asthma and took up swimming to help improve her breathing.  "Mine was a complete love affair," she later recalled. "It's a beautiful thing, diving into the cool crisp water and then just sort of being able to pull your body through the water and it opening up for you."  Her talent was spotted by coach Harry Gallagher, the latter agreeing to train her for free on account of her family's poverty.  By the age of 16 she was already breaking national records, one of a group of outstanding young Australian female swimmers of that period known collectively as "The Water Babes."  She came to world attention in February 1956 when she bettered Willy den Ouden's 20-year old world record for the 100-meters freestyle.  At her first Olympics later that year, in Melbourne, she set another world record in the same event62 secondsand took a second gold in the 4x100 meters freestyle relay, the latter also in a world record time (four minutes 17.1 seconds).  Successful defense  She repeated her 100 meters freestyle victory in Rome four years later, the only Australian woman to win a gold medal at that particular Olympiad, and the first ever woman to successfully defend an Olympic swimming title.  She also picked up two silver medals, in the 4x100 meters medley relay and 4x100 meters freestyle relay.  For all her success, however, the 1960 Games were notable as much for her clashes with sponsors, teammates and Australian swimming officials as her triumphs in the pool.  She was subsequently dropped from the Australian squad and, after further run-ins with officialdom, received a two-year ban from international competition.  Despite this, and a horrific car crash in early 1964 in which her mother was killed and Fraser herself seriously injured, she again successfully defended her 100-meter freestyle title at the Tokyo Olympics, beating off a spirited challenge from Sharon Stouder of the United States to become the first swimmer ever to win the same event at three successive Games.  The high-jinx and confrontations continued, howevershe was arrested for allegedly stealing a flag from the Japanese Imperial palaceand shortly after the 1964 Olympics the Australian Swimming Union banned her for 10 years, bringing her competitive career to an end.  She subsequently went into politics and remains an iconic figure in Australia, despite, or perhaps because of, her determined non-conformism.  "I've always been known to speak my mind," she once commented. "I think that's why Australian people like me."  In 1996 she was voted the Person Who Best Symbolizes Australia.

Africa's western black rhino is now officially extinct according the latest review of animals and plants by the world's largest conservation network.  The subspecies of the black rhinowhich is classified as "critically endangered" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Specieswas last seen in western Africa in 2006.  The IUCN warns that other rhinos could follow saying Africa's northern white rhino is "teetering on the brink of extinction" while Asia's Javan rhino is "making its last stand" due to continued poaching and lack of conservation.  Rhino horn trade triggers extinction threat  "In the case of the western black rhino and the northern white rhino the situation could have had very different results if the suggested conservation measures had been implemented," Simon Stuart, chair of the IUCN species survival commission said in a statement.  "These measures must be strengthened now, specifically managing habitats in order to improve performance, preventing other rhinos from fading into extinction," Stuart added.  The IUCN points to conservation efforts which have paid off for the southern white rhino subspecies which have seen populations rise from less than 100 at the end of the 19th century to an estimated wild population of 20,000 today.  Where animals go before extinction  Another success can be seen with the Przewalski's Horse which was listed as "extinct in the wild" in 1996 but now, thanks to a captive breeding program, has an estimated population of 300.  The latest update to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species reviews more than 60,000 species, concluding that 25% of mammals on the list are at risk of extinction.  Many plants are also under threat, say the IUCN.  Populations of Chinese fir, a conifer which was once widespread throughout China and Vietnam, is being threatened by the expansion of intensive agriculture according to the IUCN.  A type of yew tree (taxus contorta) found in Asia which is used to produce Taxol (a chemotherapy drug) has been reclassified from "vulnerable" to "endangered" on the IUCN Red List, as has the Coco de Mera palm tree found in the Seychelles islandswhich is at risk from fires and illegal harvesting of its kernels.  Recent studies of 79 tropical plants in the Indian Ocean archipelago revealed that more than three quarters of them were at risk of extinction.  In the oceans, the IUCN reports that five out of eight tuna species are now "threatened" or "near threatened," while 26 recently-discovered amphibians have been added to the Red List including the "blessed poison frog" (classified as vulnerable) while the "summers' poison frog" is endangered.  "This update offers both good and bad news on the status of many species around the world," Jane Smart, director of IUCN's global species program said in a statement.  "We have the knowledge that conservation works if executed in a timely manner, yet, without strong political will in combination with targeted efforts and resources, the wonders of nature and the services it provides can be lost forever."  
 It is an old Hollywood maxim that everyone flees from failure.  When a big movie bellyflops at the box officelike "John Carter," which has pulled in a cringe-inducing $62 million in the U.S. in its first three weekends, barely a fourth of the film's $250 million budgetusually everyone involved tries to get as much distance as they can from the film, as quickly as they can get it.  Everyone's hoping to salvage not only their careers, but their psyches as well, especially when that much blood, sweat, and treasure has been invested in a passion project that's become a media punching bag.  Apparently, no one told Taylor Kitsch this is how he's supposed to behave. When EW caught up with the actor a few hours before he was embarking on his global press tour for "Battleship"his second effects-laden big budget studio picture this yearthe 30-year-old said he had "absolutely no regrets" about his first big screen starring role. "I would do 'John Carter' again tomorrow," he says forthrightly. "I'm very proud of 'John Carter.' Box office doesn't validate me as a person, or as an actor."  Kitsch understands that the sci-fi adventure's financial failingswhile it's pulled in over $230 million worldwide, Disney still expects to lose $200 million on the filmare clearly "unfortunate," if for no other reason than it's a virtual certainty that director Andrew Stanton's planned two sequels will never see a greenlight. "I'd love to go do 'John Carter 2,'" he says. "I really would. It's just s***ty I don't get to work with the ['John Carter'] family. It really was a special thing."  But Kitsch isn't dwelling on the past. "I'm going to keep working," he says. Kitsch points out that after Battleship, he's got Oliver Stone's "Savages" coming out in July, and then he'll likely start shooting the Navy SEAL drama "Lone Survivor" for "Battleship" director Peter Berg in the fall. "It's an exciting time," he says, and he clearly means it.  See the full article at EW.com.

A Chicago hotel has closed and drained its pool, hot tub and fountain in response to the deaths of two people who contracted the flu-like Legionnaires' disease, authorities said Monday.  Since August 14, health officials have recorded eight confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease, including the two deaths, among guests who visited the JW Marriott Chicago hotel in downtown Chicago.  "We believe that there is no ongoing health threat at the hotel. Individuals who stayed at the hotel during this time period who are experiencing flu-like symptoms are encouraged to get in touch with a healthcare provider because it is important that all potential cases are diagnosed and treated as soon as possible," said Kathleen Ritger, a doctor at the Chicago Department of Public Health.  Legionnaires' disease is a respiratory bacterial infection usually spread through mist that comes from a water source, such as cooling towers, air conditioning or showers. It is not transmitted person to person. Symptoms of the disease include fever, chills and a cough. Most people recover, but between 5% to 30% of those who get the disease die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.  Each year an estimated 8,000 to 18,000 hospitalized cases occur in the United States.  An outbreak of the disease in Philadelphia in 1976, largely among people attending a convention of the American Legion, led to its name.  Along with draining a pool, fountain and hot tub, the hotel is working to alert guests who stayed there from July 16 through August 15, a Marriott spokeswoman said.

 After a typo-related delay, legislation was signed by President Barack Obama Tuesday to end budget-related FAA air traffic controller furloughs that caused widespread travel delays last week. Despite the holdup on the president's signature, the fix went into effect over the weekend.  An "s" missing from the word "accounts" was to blame, a congressional source told CNN.  The bill gives the FAA permission to move money from other accounts that allows it to stop furloughing controllers. But the way the Senate version of the bill read, it would have limited the source of funds to an "account." The Senate bill has since been fixed.  The FAA issued a statement Saturday saying that it had suspended all employee furloughs and expected normal operations to resume Sunday evening.  In rare bipartisan accord, U.S. lawmakers passed the measure Friday, capping a major congressional initiative as delays snarled traffic at airports.  The measure gives the Transportation Department budget planners new flexibility for dealing with forced spending cuts.  It also allows authorities to protect 149 control towers at small- and medium-sized airports that are slated for closure for budgetary reasons.  Thousands of flight delays were attributed to the furloughs last week.  In time for hurricane season: Furloughs in forecast at NOAA  U.S. airports don't stack up with global competitors  CNN's Kevin Bohn and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.

Libya's justice minister held a "cordial" meeting with U.S. Ambassador Deborah Jones on the capture of alleged al Qaeda operative Abu Anas al Libi by American forces over the weekend in Tripoli, two senior State Department officials said Tuesday.  The session was "all very cordial albeit with concerns," one of the officials said.  The meeting had previously been described as a "summoning," a more formal diplomatic term frequently used when one country wants to express displeasure with another.  Libya's General National Congress on Tuesday demanded that U.S. officials hand over al Libi, spokesman Omar Hmidan said. He also demanded that Libyan authorities and al Libi's family have access to him in the meantime.  The developments come as 200 heavily armed U.S. Marines headed to an Italian naval base, poised to fly at a moment's notice to Libya should the U.S. Embassy come under assault from angry crowds in the wake of al Libi's capture.  U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers captured al Libi this weekend in Tripoli. He is accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.  The deployment, which began Monday, was made in coordination with the State Department, a military official told CNN. The official called the move a "prudent measure" after the U.S. military raid to capture al Libi.  The Marines are part of a 500-member unit formed after the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi that left Ambassador Christopher Stevens and two other U.S. citizens dead. Military forces were not close enough to respond to that attack.  The official said they were being moved along with three V-22 Osprey aircraft capable of delivering them and their supplies to Libya, which lies about 328 miles (528 kilometers) across the Mediterranean Sea.  What the terror raids say about an 'Obama Doctrine'  Al Libi Interrogation  On Monday, al Libi was on a U.S. Navy warship, where he was being questioned by a high-value detainee interrogation groupan FBI-led team with intelligence experts from the CIA and other agencieswhich is determining whether he has information about al Qaeda operations, future attacks or the whereabouts of known associates, U.S. officials have said.  A Defense Department statement says he is being held "lawfully under the law of war in a secure location outside of Libya."  It is unclear how long he will be interrogated, but U.S. officials have said he will be transferred to New York for trial.  The 49-year-old alleged al Qaeda operative is accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people and wounded about 4,000 more.  He was indicted in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia.  Wife: al Libi no longer with al Qaeda  Civilian trial  President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have previously said they prefer to try individuals such as al Libi in American courts.  Al Libi isn't on alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's level, so don't expect the same hullabaloo over U.S. plans to try the Libyan terror suspect on American soil, legal experts said Monday.  "He will be brought back to the United States and tried in a federal criminal courtroom," CNN senior analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. "Obama's trying to close Guantanamo, not add prisoners."  And unlike previous cases, such as Mohammed's, "I really don't think there's going to be too much protest or concern or worry if they proceed that way," said James Forest, a professor and the director of security studies at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.  "I honestly don't think he has the name-brand recognition, shall we say, of a Khalid Sheikh Mohammed," Forest said.  In the past, terrorism suspects captured on American soil generally have been tried in federal courtssuch as Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab, the would-be "undiebomber" who tried unsuccessfully to set off a bomb on a U.S.-bound jetliner in 2009; attempted Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad; or 9/11 co-conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.  It's "murky territory" when a fugitive is nabbed overseas by American forces, said Forest, a former director of terrorism studies at West Point. But "my hunch is they'll probably go the criminal route."  When the White House in 2009 proposed trying Mohammed and four other 9/11 suspects in Manhattan, the plan was met with staunch criticism from Republican leaders who said such a trial would be costly and asserted that the five terror suspectsnone of whom was an American citizendidn't deserve the rights and protections civilian courts afford defendants.  In 2011, Holder begrudgingly announced that the five suspected conspirators' fates would be decided via military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prompting backlash from Democrats and human rights groups who painted the tribunals as untested, flawed and the likely subject of numerous legal challenges.  "Had this case proceeded in Manhattan or in an alternative venue in the United States, as I seriously explored in the past year, I am confident that our justice system would have performed with the same distinction that has been its hallmark for over 200 years," Holder said at the time.  Al Libi's case should not raise the same issues, Toobin said, because, as the suspected 9/11 mastermind, Mohammed was "in a separate category from everyone else in the world."  While the United States considers al Libi a dangerous terrorist, neither he nor his crimes are as well-known as Mohammed's, Toobin said.  As for al Libi's interrogation, Toobin noted that there is no indication he is being tortured and that if al Libi were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques, the U.S. government has been clear that "they will not use the results of torture like waterboarding in any criminal case."  "The government obviously believes he's a very dangerous person, captured in a dangerous part of the world, and he needs to be isolated and brought back to the United States," Toobin said.  But Forest questioned how much valuable intelligence al Libi would be able to provide his captors. A former jihadist associate told CNN it was unlikely that he was still playing an active role with the terrorist network, and his wife said he had been living a normal life and was seeking a job with the Libyan oil ministry.  "Who knows if he's really up to speed on anything useful these days?" Forest asked.  Opinion: Good thing U.S. terrorist hunters weren't furloughed  
 Situated at the heart of Southeast Asia, Singapore is one of the most densely populated countries on the planet.  More than 5 million people are crammed into this bustling city-state with an area of just 276 square miles.  The squeeze is so tight there's little room left to take advantage of the surrounding natural beauty.  But one developer wants to tap into the tourism market by singling out the nearby Riau Archipelago to host "Funtasy Island," the world's largest eco-resort.  The $240 million development, currently in construction, will stretch out over a cluster of six islands covering almost 3.3 million square meters (35 million square feet).  While the archipelago lies just 16 kilometers (9 miles) off the coast of Singapore, the area is actually part of and administered by neighboring Indonesia.  Crystal clear water, coral reefs and thousands of mangrove trees provide the stunning backdrop to marinas, villas, luxury bungalows and hotel accommodation.  It's already an impressive site but the "property is just a start," said Funtasy Island Pte Director, Michael Yong.  Eco-tourism  Roughly 70% of the islands will be preserved in their natural statepart of the developer's commitment to creating a viable eco-park.  "Without that 70% of the natural attractions, our island development will be just like any other or another real estate development," Yong continued.  Nature trails and aquaculture tours will allow visitors to enjoy Riau's natural beauty while the short boat ride to Singapore keeps popular attractions like Universal Studios and Marina Bay Sands close.  But being green also means development plans have had to be stringently checked and monitored.  Caps have been set on future visitors, buildings have been relocated from where they were originally slated for and the overall number of units has been paired back.  According to Syarief Santoso, director of WOW Design Studio, such amendments were necessary to maintain authenticity.  "It has to feel like we are blend with the nature," Santoso said.  "We don't want to change that, we want to blend into this environment and make everything balanced, everything synchronized."  Foreign ownership  The average cost per square meter of property comes in at about $5,000.  If that sounds like a deal for an over-the-water villa a short stroll from a powdery white beach, there's a reason.  In line with Indonesian property law, foreign investors can't buy their piece of paradise here, only lease it for set terms.  "We are actually selling the lease of the building," Yong explained. "Every 25 years we do an extension for 20 years, every 20 years we do another renewal."  The developers say many investors are undeterred.  More than 500 homes have sold to date, mostly to buyers from Singapore, Malaysia and China  In total over 1,200 holiday villas and apartments will be needed to house the one million tourists expected each year.  With Funtasy Island set to welcome its first guests in late 2015, there's not long left to ensure everything is in place to meet that target.

In today's technology-laden society, hearing of crimes solved or cold cases cracked with state-of-the-art tech tools has become commonplace. But for one New Jersey family all it took to catch an alleged thief was a camera and a little luck.  John Myers and his family from Bloomfield, New Jersey, were visiting Madison, Wisconsin, to attend a friend's wedding Saturday at the state Capitol.  According to Myers, the family went outside after the ceremony to take pictures. He decided it would be a good idea to take a family portrait with his digital camera, and he set a bag down next to the building before stepping away to snap the shot.  Unbeknown to him, Myersas he captured the scenealso caught a person red-handed stealing his bag.  "Looking back now it wasn't a good idea to leave my bag so far away," Myers told CNN on Tuesday. "But I just wasn't thinking of it at the time."  Myers looked at the picture quickly but admits he was checking just to make sure everyone came out OK. It was only after walking away that he realized he had forgotten his bagwhich contained his wallet, hotel and rental car keys and other family valuables.  Myers said that when he returned to the spot, the bag was missing. No one had turned it in at the information center inside the Capitol.  He realized then that someone must have taken it. After stepping outside the building and seeing wedding photographers, he decided to take a second look at the pictures he had just taken.  It turned out to be the right hunch. In the background of the family portrait, Myers saw an image of someone reaching into his bag as it sat. He took it to the Wisconsin Capitol Police, which immediately went into action.  "The Capitol Police are amazing," Myers said. "I fully expected to have them tell us to just fill a report [out] or [to] tell us there wasn't much they could do, but [they] responded immediately and because they did, they were able to catch [a suspect]."  After Myers showed the pictures, two officers were immediately dispatched to look for a suspect, while a third stayed with Myers and sent out a description.  Within 15 minutes, Myers said, police had arrested a suspect and also located the bag and all his belongings, some of which had been thrown away during the heist.  According to Wisconsin authorities, a homeless man identified as Glenn R. Lambright was arrested. He was released Tuesday from Dane County Jail on a signature bond. It was not known Tuesday night whether Lambright had an attorney.  Myers said the quick police response pleasantly surprised him.  "I caught the picture, but I was even more amazed they managed to find the person since all they had to go on was his clothinghis face wasn't in the picture," he said.  
 Legislation providing for government-funded contraception and sex education classes in the Philippines will take effect in mid-January, according to a spokeswoman for President Benigno Aquino.  Aquino signed the bill on December 21, deputy presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte said in a statement released Saturday.  Lawmakers nearly two weeks ago approved the legislation, and a reconciliation committee was tasked with working out differences in the versions passed by the two houses.  Despite widespread popular support, the Catholic Church opposed the measure, saying it will destroy marriage and morality in the Philippines. More than 80% of the Philippines' 96 million residents are Catholic.  Passage of the bill closed a divisive chapter in the country's history, said Valte, according to the official Philippines News Agency.  The act "opens the possibility of cooperation and reconciliation among different sectors in society: engagement and dialogue characterized not by animosity, but by our collective desire to better the welfare of the Filipino people," she said.  Read one senator's opinion: 'Why we fought'  Sen. Edgardo Angara, who voted for the measure, called the bill "an affirmation of human rights," according to CNN affiliate ABS-CBN.  "We have to consider that not all Filipinos are Catholics. We have Muslims, Protestants, Buddhists, nonbelievers," he said at the time of the bill's passage, according to ABS-CBN.

By most accounts, the showdown was pretty brutal.  Many declared Jon Stewart, right, the victor in his face-to-face with Jim Cramer on "The Daily Show."  Many watching Thursday night's "Daily Show" on Comedy Central felt that comedian-turned-media-critic Jon Stewart held bombastic financial guru and CNBC "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer's feet to the fire.  And Cramer flinched.  Stewart, known for his zany, satirical take on the news, was serious as he took Cramer's network to task for what Stewart viewed as their "cheerleading" of corporations at the heart of the nation's current economic crisis.  And despite the title of his financial show, Cramer came off as less mad and more apologetic.  Watch Stewart vs. Cramer   "If it was a prize fight, they would have stopped it," said Howard Kurtz, the "Washington Post" media critic and host of CNN's "Reliable Sources." "I was stunned that Jim Cramer kind of did a rope-a-dope strategy and didn't really defend himself against Jon Stewart's assault."  Kurtz is very familiar with the style of both men.  He has appeared on "The Daily Show" and is the author of "The Fortune Tellers: Inside Wall Street's Game of Money, Media and Manipulation," in which Cramer is featured.  Kurtz said Stewart "made clear at the outset that he wasn't going for laughs" and displayed very much the same passion for holding the media accountable as he did when he appeared on, and denounced, CNN's "Crossfire." Watch the debate on "Reliable Sources"  "When I went on [Stewart's] show last year, he was so wound up in ripping the media that he went on for another 10 minutes, knowing full well that we were out of time," Kurtz said. "Stewart, as funny as he can be, is a very trenchant media critic who cares passionately about this stuff, and we saw that Thursday night."  iReporter David Seaman of New York said he was surprised at the vigor with which Stewart "attacked Cramer's credibility." Check out David's iReport  The public wants answers as to how the country got into such financial distress, and viewers really want someone to answer for the mess, Seaman said.  "People want to see a lot of the financial gurus on a shish kabob, being skewered," Seaman said. "It's really important to hold people accountable, and as we saw last night, Jon Stewart is a bit of a wild card, so if you aren't living up to expectations, he may call you out."  David Brancaccio, host and senior editor of "Now on PBS," commended Cramer for his bravery in going on the show, though he said he was surprised that the brilliant founder of TheStreet.com seemed ill-prepared for Stewart's very thoughtful questioning.  Brancaccio, the former host of American Public Media's "Marketplace" radio program, echoed the comments of many in that he found the exchange visibly uncomfortable for the usually showman-like Cramer.  "You have the comedian as journalist, and you have the financial journalist as clown, in that on his show, Cramer's goofing around and plays the clown," Brancaccio said. "What a role reversal."  Brancaccio said Stewart's show has emerged as an important vehicle for media criticism. Thursday night's show marked an important moment in journalism, especially financial reporting, Brancaccio said.  "It's really important that tough questions are asked, because when tough questions aren't asked, we end up with Enron," he said. "It's interesting that the tough questions came from Jon Stewart, brilliant comedian that he is."  Brancaccio thinks the episode may serve as a cautionary tale for those in the media who don't do their due diligence. White House approves of smackdown  "I don't think any financial journalist wants to be in Cramer's position," Brancaccio said. "I think [journalists] may redouble their efforts to be dispassionate reporters asking the tough questions."  Steve Krakauer is associate editor of TVNewser.com, one of the leading blogs about the television news industry, and said comments at his site have been mixed about the show.  Although some thought it was one of the best interviews they had ever seen, others found Stewart arrogant and said his outrage might have been a bit staged.  Krakauer said the question now is where Cramerwho has said he plans to make some changes to his showgoes from here.  Krakauer said he doubts that there will be a complete overhaul of "Mad Money."  "I can't see things drastically changing," Krakauer said. " 'Mad Money' is one of the most successful shows on CNBC. Despite what has been written about Jim Cramer, the things he's gotten incorrect and the calls he has made, he's still popular and one of the most entertaining for people who are interested in that type of financial news."  If anything, Cramer's appearance on "The Daily Show" may have just stoked the flames. Comedy Central's Web site played it up with clips from the show that it called "an historic moment in basic cable."  The topic is such a hot one that Kurtz will lead "Reliable Sources" with it Sunday, with journalist Tucker Carlson, radio show host Stephanie Miller and "Baltimore Sun" television critic David Zurawik as guests.  "Beyond the entertainment value, and we are not above that, this is a really important moment for holding financial journalists accountable," Kurtz said. "It may have taken Jon Stewart to blow the whistle on some of the hype and shortsightedness at America's top business news channel, but those failings were repeated throughout the business press, which stumbled badly in reporting on what turned into a huge financial meltdown."  
 An out-of-control monster truck crashed into the stands at a show in Oregon, injuring three spectators seated in the front row, authorities said.  Onlooker Dustin Earls captured video of the scene Saturday at the "Monster Air 2012" show in Harrisburg.  Earls told CNN he was watching the third drag race of the event when one of the drivers started heading for a mud pit in front of the seating area.  "The truck got a little wild and he hit the mud pit," Earls said. "I thought, 'This guy's just messing around; he'll hit his brakes right here.'"  But the oversized truck didn't stop. Video shot by Earls on his mobile phone shows the truck making a hard right turn and driving straight into the panicked crowd.  "I heard his axle snap as soon as he hit the mud," Earls said. "As soon as he hit that line, he lost control of his steering and his brakes."  Earls' video becomes jumbled as he runs to safety, but the screams of frightened spectators can be heard in the background.  A Linn County Sheriff's sergeant told CNN affiliate KVAL three people in the crowd were hurt.  Earls said the driver immediately got out of the truck to see if anyone was injured.  "He wanted to know if everything was okay," Earls said, "He was so concerned. He said, 'Oh my God, I can't believe what happened.'"  KVAL reported the driver told authorities the rear wheels on his 1970 Ford spun out in the mud, and he crashed into a barricade. The truck cleared the barricade and its 48-inch tires landed on three spectators, KVAL reported.  The sheriff's sergeant told KVAL the victims' injuries were not life-threatening.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren has just been handed a giant political opportunity.  After spending several years championing the cause of the consumer and railing against the power of big banks, the Massachusetts Democrat may be perfectly positioned to react to the revelation of secretly taped conversations within the Federal Reserve that have exposed the cozy relationship that exists between the regulators in Washington and the regulated on Wall Street.  The tapes, which were made in 2012, involve examiners for the New York Federal Reserve who are heard being protective and deferential to Goldman Sachs when discussing some financial transactions that the firm had undertaken. Their actions were said to be "legal but shady."  One of the Federal Reserve officials on the tape explains that they should not be too tough with the banks to make sure the lines of communication remain open in the future: "We don't want to discourage Goldman from disclosing these types of things in the future and therefore maybe you know some comment that says don't mistake our inquisitiveness, and our desire to understand more about the marketplace in general, as a criticism of you as a firm necessarily."  The tapes have shocked many listeners because they reveal how weak the rules are and, even worse, how the regulators don't have much interest in being tough with the banks. Years after the horrendous financial collapse of 2008 that led to international economic havoc, Washington is not doing very much to improve the situation. There have been many critics of the Dodd-Frank legislation who have warned that the law fell short, but to actually hear these conversations has a more powerful impact.  As Warren said on an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, when people listen to the tapes "for a moment, [they] get to be the fly on the wall that watches all of it, and there it is to be exposed to everyone: the cozy relationship, the fact that the Fed is more concerned about its relationship with a 'too-big-to-fail' bank than it is with protecting the American public."  Warren, who was instrumental to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, reacted to the substance of the tape by arguing that "the point of these tapes is that the regulators are backing off long before anyone's in court making a legal argument about whether or not they came right up to the line or they crossed over the line." She has called for oversight hearings as soon as possible.  The weakness of our regulatory system for finance is an issue that deserves attention, and it is a policy problem that attracts the interest of liberals, conservatives and moderates, all of whom have been stung by the economic toll of the financial meltdown.  Anger toward the banking system is one of the few issues that provides a common thread between the disparate parts of our political world. Tea party Republicans hate the intimate connections between banking and politicians as much as do left-wing Democrats.  If Warren handles oversight hearings on this problem in the right way, they could attract huge interest and really define who she is as a national politician, right as the 2016 presidential race heats up. In this case, politics and policy can work hand in hand.  Given the widespread concern about this problem and Warren's skill at handling this issue, these could shape up to be hearings that have the same kind of impact as Sen. William Fulbright's classic interrogation of officials about Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam policies in 1966 or the select committee investigation of Watergate in 1973 when Sen. Sam Ervin revealed all the wrongs that Richard Nixon had committed.  Right now the Democratic playing field for 2016 is more fluid than many think. While former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, assuming she runs, would be a formidable candidate and a clear frontrunner, there is also still room for another candidate to challenge her and potentially to rise to the top of the pack.  While many names have been mentioned, like Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley or former Virginia Sen. James Webb, nobody other than Clinton generates the kind of excitement as does Elizabeth Warren.  Clinton exposed some of her own vulnerabilities during the roll out for her book "Hard Choices," and there still remains big questions as to whether Democrats will want a fresher voice, one who speaks more directly to the populist economic tradition of the party, as their candidate. While today it seems inevitable that she will be the party's nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton learned in 2008 that "inevitable" doesn't always cut it.  Warren has said that she won't run for the presidency. But these kinds of statements rarely are the best way to predict what a candidate will actually do.  The Fed tapes might prove to be the development that moves her to the front and center of the public eye. Oversight hearings would be a way to expose her to a large national audience and to demonstrate that she is deeply invested in solving the economic problems that have harmed the security of Americans and been at the heart of the laggard economic conditions that define our era.  Warren has been a huge attraction on the campaign trail during the past few months, speaking about these very issues and promising to devote her time to this cause.  Ever since Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy died, Democrats have not been able to find a new liberal lion to champion the progressive economic traditions that been so integral to the party since the New Deal.  President Obama, who many Democrats thought would be that person, has failed to live up to expectations. He surrounded himself with economic advisors who were comfortable with the status quo and whose pragmatism pushed him away from the bolder policies that the Democratic base hoped for.  Now, with the disclosure of these tapes, Warren has a very real chance to prove to Democrats that she is the new voice.  
 Timekeeping in the United States, which was already a pretty precise science involving lasers and atomic particles, just got even more exact.  A new atomic clock, so accurate it will lose or gain only one second every 300 million years, was unveiled Thursday by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce.  The NIST-F2 had been in development for about a decade and is three times more accurate than the F1, which has been in use since 1999. The institute will continue operating both clocks for now at its campus in Boulder, Colorado.  The clock is used for civilian purposes in the United States and its data is shared with the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris.  The clocks work by using lasers to create a fountain of cesium atoms. "Pings" from those atoms as they move are counted to measure the exact length of a second.  Tom O'Brian, chief of NIST's time and frequency division, said the F2 was made more accurate by lowering the temperature of the area surrounding it.  All that is fine. But why go to all this trouble? Most of us won't get fired for being a few trillionths of a second late for work, right?  Well, no. But many of the systems we use in our high-tech world need to be a lot more precise.  "Modern telecommunication networks require synchronization to about a millionth of a second per day," O'Brian said. "Power grids also ... (and) GPS systems require about 1 billionth of a second per day.  "All of these technologies, and many more that we use every day, rely on exquisite timing and synchronization that is only possible with atomic clocks."  The NIST-F2 is expected to lose about one trillionth of a second per day. That's way more accuracy than any of today's technology needs and, hopefully, will be plenty for the next generation of innovation as well.  "If we've learned anything in the last 60 years of building atomic clocks, we've learned that every time we build a better clock, somebody comes up with a use for it that you couldn't have foreseen," says physicist Steven Jefferts, lead designer of NIST-F2.  So, is the NIST-F2 as good as it gets? Not really. While it might be the most accurate atomic clock to use cesium, researchers say there are already clocks that use other atoms being tested and that those are even more precise.  Some of those divide time into units more than 100 times more accurate than even the brand-new F2, O'Brian said.  "I think all those clocks are going to be so good that we're really going to have to change our perspective about what we mean by 'time'," he said.

Ivory Coast says it will not transfer former first lady Simone Gbagbo to the International Criminal Court, and plans to try her in a domestic court instead.  Gbagbo is accused of crimes against humanity following postelection violence in 2010.  Her husband, former president Laurent Gbagbo, is in the custody of the Hague-based court awaiting trial over similar charges.  Government officials said they plan to file a motion to dismiss an arrest warrant against her.  "The councils' decision is to judge Mrs. Gbagbo in Ivory Coast, by the Ivorian courts which have now been restored and even to guarantee her a fair trial with the rights to a defense," the government said in a statement Friday.  Officials said they will inform the international court of the decision.  Alleged crimes against humanity  The former first lady is accused of crimes against humanity in the aftermath of her husband's election defeat in 2010.  Laurent Gbagbo, then the incumbent president, refused to step down after Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of the election. The standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of the two sides, leaving thousands dead.  The ICC warrant issued last year alleges that as a member of the president's inner circle, his wife was an "indirect co-perpetrator." She attended meetings where plans were discussed and carried out to persecute Ouattara supporters, according to the warrant.  Her husband surrendered to the ICC in December of that year, and is currently awaiting trial at The Hague on crimes against humanity for the civil unrest and deaths.  Both have denied the charges.  Backlash against the ICC  African governments have accused the Hague-based court of unfairly targeting the continent.  The African Union plans to hold a meeting next month to discuss withdrawal of member nations from the ICC to protest what it describes as "hunting" of leaders from the continent.  Its planned meeting comes as Kenyan deputy president, William Ruto, is undergoing trial at the court on charges related to postelection violence in 2007.  Kenya's parliament voted to leave the ICC this month, days before the deputy president's trial started.  So far, all cases before the ICC are against Africans in eight countries. They include Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Libya, Ivory Coast and Mali.  Some of the cases such as Ivory Coast were supported by their respective governments.  
 It was a staggering sight, even in a Mexican city that has seen its share of violence in recent years as drug-related crimes surged.  Seven bodies sat slumped in white plastic chairs placed near a central plaza in Uruapan, Mexico.  Local media reported messages were left behind, written on poster board and pinned to some of the victims' bodies with icepicks.  The men appeared to have been killed by gunfire, and investigators believe organized crime groups are to blame, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency said. Investigators haven't provided details about who they suspect was responsible or why they targeted the menwindshield washers and farm workers, according to Notimex.  Uruapan, a city of a quarter million people in the western state of Michoacan, made headlines in 2006 when members of a drug cartelLa Familia Michoacanahurled five decapitated heads of rival gang members onto a dance floor there.  That cartel has since fractured, but violence in the region has remained a grisly reality.  The seven corpses found in Uruapan last weekend were among at least 30 killed nationwidea high death toll that once again drew attention toward drug-related violence in Mexico, where more than 60,000 people were killed in drug-related violence from 2006 to 2012, according to Human Rights Watch.  Read more: Rape case in Mexican resort city puts violence back into the spotlight  The violence comes as Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto pushes a new strategy aimed at focusing more on dealing with social and economic issues that fuel the drug trade and less on combating cartels head-on.  Uruapan is among the metropolitan areas in Mexico tapped for the president's new program, which aims to prevent violence, school dropouts, addiction and domestic violence, and also to better detect problems in Mexico's education system.  Without jobs and social programs, Pena Nieto told CNN last year, millions of Mexicans "have no other option than to dedicate themselves sometimes to criminal activity."  The goal of the government's new strategy, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said last month, is creating a "culture of peace and respecting the law."  Mexico reports more than 26,000 missing  "It is the responsibility of the state to pursue criminals and punish them to preserve peace and harmony," he said, "but we are convinced that fighting and punishment alone do not resolve the problem."  Some analysts have praised the new government approach.  "The cartels have been able to recruit tens of thousands of killers in part because poor neighborhoods have been systematically abandoned over decades and lack sufficient schools, community centers and securityin short they lack opportunity," the International Crisis Group said in a recent report on Mexico's cartel violence. "There are many dedicated Mexican social workers with the experience and ability to reach the vulnerable groups if they are given resources. If they succeed in reducing violence, theirs can become a security model to follow instead of one to fear."  Will the new strategy work?  Is this past weekend's violence in Uruapan and elsewhere a sign that the new tack isn't working?  It's soon to tell, less than four month's into Pena Nieto's presidency, one analyst told CNN en Espaol this week.  "In politics, there are no miracles, in economics, there are no miracles, and in security even less so," said Jose Carreno, a Mexican journalist who has covered the government's security strategy. "They are things that happen little by little, gaining ground piece by piece."  It could be up to a year before any significant changes show up in statistics, he said. And it's likely Mexican military troops deployed by former President Felipe Calderon to fight cartels will remain in the streets for another year as well, he said.  "I do not see any immediate substitute for them," he said.  Some Mexicans have said they aren't ready to wait for a change in the government's approach.  Self-defense groups have started forming in some areas where government troops haven't been able to put a stop to cartel violence.  "We think the government is very timid, very slow," Sergio Mejia, the head of an association of restaurant and business owners in Acapulco, told CNN last month. "If there is no immediate response, it leaves us no choice but to join the fight."  Authorities are investigating the emerging defense groups, a top Mexican official told CNN en Espaol this week.  "It is an investigation to find out who they are, what weapons they have, how many of them there are, what they are pursuing, etc. We have them located, mapped, all of them. We are busy resolving the issue," said Manuel Mondragon, Mexico's national security commissioner. "What are we going to do? Well, this is an issue that I can't reveal openly, but what I can say is that we have them precisely located and identified."  13-year-old assassin murdered in Mexico  U.S. approach also shifting  In a report to Congress this month, the U.S. State Department said some efforts to combat cartels in Mexico have paid off. Major cartel leaders have been captured, the report says, and the number of annual deaths because of drug-related violence declined from 2011 to 2012.  The United States and Mexico's cooperation to fight cartels is "unprecedented," according to the State Department's 2013 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which says the United States has provided $1.1 billion in security aid to Mexico since 2008 through the Merida Initiative.  More leaders of criminal organizations have been brought to justice as a result, the report says.  "That success, however, has also resulted in smaller, fractured organizations that have violently attempted to consolidate their power," the report says. And with profits from the drug trade dropping, cartels have turned to other activities, such as kidnapping, extortion and human trafficking.  The report suggests that for the United States, too, it's time for a new approach.  "The focus of U.S.-Mexico cooperation has shifted from providing large-scale equipment to engaging in training and capacity building, and from focusing on the federal-level to building state- and municipal-level capabilities. Accordingly, justice sector reforms, drug demand reduction, and culture of lawfulness initiatives should play a larger role," the report said. "The United States should also continue programs to curb its domestic drug demand and inhibit the illegal flow of arms and cash into Mexico."  Pena Nieto has been pushing for ties for the neighboring nations to go beyond the drug war.  And security issues received only a slight mention in statements from both governments Wednesday announcing President Barack Obama's plans to visit Mexico in May.  As officials change their tones and tactics, authorities in Uruapan also will be trying a new approach, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency reported Wednesday.  Next month, officials will open trade-in centers there and elsewhere in Michoacan state where residents can receive tablets, netbooks or money.  In exchange, they'll have to hand in their guns.

	 'Ivory Coast says it will not transfer former first lady Simone Gbagbo to'
The old met the new. At one end of the court, the young man nicknamed "Baby Federer"at the other was one of the all-time tennis greats, albeit one who is battling to show that he's not a spent force.  One of them has 77 career titles, but only one this year, while the othera former top-ranked juniorwon his first on the ATP Tour last weekend.  And after losing the first two games, despite a vociferous home backing, it certainly looked like Roger Federer might be headed for another disappointing defeat.  But the Swiss legend battled back to show why he is the holder of a record 17 grand slam titles as he denied Grigor Dimitrov10 years younger at 22a famous victory in Basel.  Federer, now ranked a comparatively lowly sixth by his high standards, eventually triumphed 6-3 7-6 (7-2) against the Bulgarian as he also came from behind in the second set to force the tie-break.  "It was very important to win in two sets," said Federer, who notched his 50th win in his home city eventa feat he had previously managed only in the four majors.  "There were a lot of free gifts out there in some games. When I saved three set points I just told myself to play one point at a time and hope to get there.  "I broke him and that made it difficult for him. I was able to come through well in the tiebreaker. It always feels good to win at home."  If Federer can next beat Canada's Vasek Pospisil in the semifinals of the Swiss Indoor s event and then win it for a record-extending sixth time, he will qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals in London with one tournament to sparenext week's Paris Masters.  See the similarities between Federer and Dimitrov  That there has been doubt Federer might not participate in next month's season-endera tournament he has won six times since 2003is a measure of how much he has struggled this year.  If 2012 was his return to the top, a year in which he won Wimbledon a record-equaling seventh time, regained the No. 1 ranking and broke the milestone for most weeks at the summit, then 2013 has been a major comedown.  After reaching the semifinals at January's Australian Open, he lost in the quarters at Roland Garros, the second round at Wimbledon and in the last 16 in New York.  Injuries and experiments with new rackets have taken the edge off his once invincible aura, giving players like Dimitrov real hope that they can claim a never-to-be-forgotten scalp.  But not this time. Federer will next face a 23-year-old ranked 40th in the world, with a 17-16 record this year.  But Pospisil is showing a return to the form that helped him beat world No. 6 Tomas Berdych in Montreal in August, reaching his third ATP Tour semifinal this season with a 7-6 (11-9) 6-4 win over Croatia's Ivan Dodig.  Saturday's other semi will be between defending champion Juan Martin del Potro, who beat Federer in last year's final, and Frenchman Edouard Roger-Vasselin.  Del Potro, who has already qualified for one of the eight places in London, became just the sixth Argentine to register 300 career wins as he defeated qualifier Henri-Paul Mathieu 6-4 6-4.  The world No. 5, who now has a record of 300-120, is seeking his fourth title this year.  Meanwhile, world No. 3 David Ferrer continued the defense of his Valencia Open title by reaching the semifinals with a 6-4 4-6 6-0 win over Polish fifth seed Jerzy Janowicz.  The Spaniard will next play compatriot Nicolas Almagro, while Russians Mikhail Youzhny and Dmitry Tursunov will contest the other semi.  
 A top Mexican official says Mexico's drug policy is not a "war" against drug cartels, but a comprehensive strategy of the federal government to dismantle criminal organizations while at the same time strengthening institutions.  In a blog published by the Office of Mexican President Felipe Calderon, National Security Spokesman Alejandro Poire says the main objectives of the Mexican national security strategy are to strengthen the rule of law and reduce crime.  "This is not 'the government's war against drugs,' but the fight of all Mexicans to build an authentic security, based on the rule of law and justice," Poire said.  President Felipe Calderon's drug policy has come under scrutiny as violence increases. The Mexican government's estimate indicates more than 35,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Calderon took office in December 2006 for a six-year term.  Critics in Mexico and abroad have repeatedly said it is time for the Mexican government to reassess its hard-line drug strategy, because it has become counterproductive. Poire, who recently spoke on the issue of drug violence in Mexico at Harvard University in Boston, addressed the criticism on his blog.  "A policy of omission, simulation, or even worse, of negotiation (with the cartels]) would have been negligent and criminal," Poire said. "It would have postponed the effort to seek solutions much longer and left the population at the mercy of organized crime."  His comments were published six days after the U.S. Department of State broadened its travel warning for Mexico, advising American citizens to avoid certain areas and steer clear of driving at night. The advisory singles out 11 Mexican states, including border states like Sonora, Chihuahua and Tamaulipas.  The warning issued Friday strongly urges Americans to "travel only during daylight hours throughout Mexico, to avoid isolated roads and to use toll roads whenever possible." It also notes, "There's no evidence that U.S. tourists have been targeted by criminal elements due to their citizenship."  According to the U.S. State Department, 150,000 Americans cross the border into Mexico every day for study, tourism or business and at least 1 million U.S. citizens live in Mexico.  In a recent interview with CNN, a top Mexican tourism official said that in spite of the violence, tourism in Mexico last year was "very robust."  Rodolfo Lopez Negrete, chief operating officer of the Mexico Tourism Bureau, said, "Major tourism destinations that we have in Mexico, whether you refer to sun-and-beach resorts or inland destinations, those are perfectly safe."  Lopez Negrete said violence mostly occurs in "border towns with the United States, in the northeastern section of our country." However, violence in the beach resort of Acapulco has dramatically increased in the last three years. According to the Acapulco morgue, there were 1,010 violent deaths in the Pacific coastal city in 2010.

Farmers in Tanzania are helping to conserve threatened forests by cultivating an unlikely crop: butterflies.  The Amani Butterly Project is one of the schemes using butterfly farming to help locals supplement their incomes and protect the environment at the same time.  The brainchild of American biologist Theron Morgan-Brown, it's based in Tanzania's East Usambara Mountainsa region known for its biodiversity, but where forests are being cleared to produce charcoal and to open up farmland.  "The main objective was to find an alternative income for the local community in the surrounding village and forest, and also relieve the pressure on the forest of people cutting timber," says project manager Amiri Saidi.  The butterfly rearing process starts with farmers catching a few female butterflies and transferring them to an enclosure where they can lay eggs on host plants.  The farmers then collect the eggs and when they hatch, the caterpillars that emerge are placed on new plants, which must be regularly replaced to satisfy their voracious appetites. The caterpillars continue to feed until they pupate, and are ready to be transported.  Green in vogue at Nigeria Fashion Week  The Amani project has been selling pupae to live butterfly exhibits in the United States and Europe for between $1 and $2.50 each. Of that sum, 65% goes directly to the farmers, while another 7% goes to a community development fund that contributes to projects such as building schools and hospitals.  Because most tropical butterflies don't live for long, exhibits usually order new pupae every two to three weeks.  Farmers keep some pupae from each generation, so they rarely need to catch more female butterflies from the wild, although they sometimes catch new male butterflies to maintain genetic diversity in their farms.  The project now uses 250 butterfly farmers, more than half of them women, says Saidi.  He says the project's own studies show that because butterfly farmers rely on forests near their communities to provide host plants for their butterfly farms, many farmers now support forest conservation.  "Because butterfly farmers get tangible benefits, they get money, people involved in butterfly farming conserve the area," says Saidi. "They have their own forest area and use the money they are getting for replanting and other activities."  As well as training its own farmers the Amani project has helped train farmers for a butterfly project on the Tanzanian archipelago of Zanzibar.  The Zanzibar Butterfly Centre consists of a netted tropical garden that's home to hundreds of butterflies, all bred by local farmers. It was created as a tourist attraction, funded by admission fees, and like the Amani project the aim is to help protect the environment.  Congo's erupting volcano boosts tourism  "A lot of forest is being destroyed in Zanzibar," says project manager Rosa Santilli. "Local people cut down trees to make charcoal to sell. People need it for fuel because gas and electricity is very expensive, so people cook with charcoal.  "The center was set up to stop local people cutting the forest down, and to provide an alternative for them to earn money from."  Santili says the center has trained 17 local farmers to rear the pupae that provide all the center's butterflies.  It's not a solution to deforestation, but it is helping, says Santili. "The butterfly farmers don't make charcoal anymore, so it has stopped that small sector of the community cutting down trees," she says.  Like the Amani project, the Zanzibar center funds a village development association, which is improving the local water supply. It is also trying to get local people to produce crafts and honey to be sold as souvenirs at the center.  But there is a cloud on the horizon. Both the Amani and Zanzibar schemes rely on couriers to transport their pupae to overseas buyers, and they say they have been hit by courier DHL's decision to stop transporting their pupae.  Saidi says Amani has been hit especially badly. It now has to transport pupae by air cargo, which dramatically increases their cost to buyers.  He says that until the end of 2010 the Amani project was selling a total of 50,000 pupae a year to 13 buyers, but now the project has lost all but one buyer. But DHL says it will be now discussing transport options with both projects, and hopes to find a solution that will let it resume pupae deliveries.  The Zanzibar center sees exporting pupae as key to getting more locals trained as butterfly farmers.  Santilli says: "We are hoping to expand to get more farmers involved. We need butterflies for our garden and also to export. If the farmers can export to Europe then the sky's the limit."  
 (RS.com)Neil Young has filed for divorce from Pegi Young, his wife of 36 years and frequent musical collaborator.  A petition for dissolution of marriage was filed by Young in their hometown of San Mateo, California, on July 29. A hearing is scheduled for December 12. A rep for Neil Young had no comment.  Pegi is the inspiration for some of Young's most enduring love songs, including "Such a Woman," "Unknown Legend" and "Once an Angel." She began serving as his background singer in the 1990s, sharing the stage with him at the 1994 Academy Awards and numerous tours over the past 20 years.  Review: Neil Young's 'A Letter Home'  They last performed together at the Bridge School Benefit in October of 2013.  Neil first met Pegi when she was working as a waitress at a diner near his California ranch, a story he tells in the 1992 song "Unknown Legend." "I used to order just to watch her float across the floor," he sang. "She grew up in a small town/Never put her roots down."  20 insanely great Neil Young songs only hardcore fans know  Pegi has released three solo albums since 2007 and she's toured extensively on her own, occasionally with Neil on guitar. Inspired by the lack of educational opportunities for their son Ben, who suffers from cerebral palsy, they co-founded the Bridge School in 1986, which educates children with severe physical impairments. They raise funds for it every year with an all-star concert in Mountain View, California.  Neil recently wrapped up a European Crazy Horse tour and is slated to play American solo acoustic dates in October. Pegi just concluded a brief U.S. club tour. They were both slated to play Farm Aid in Raleigh, North Carolina, on September 13, though Pegi's name was recently removed from the lineup.  See the original story at RollingStone.com.

 Actor Kristian Nairnaka Hodor on "Game of Thrones"was never in the closet.  But as a firm believer in the need to "stand up and be counted," Nairn has confirmed he's gay in an interview with "GoT" fan site Winter Is Coming.  "(W)hen you talk about 'the gay community,' you are talking about MY community," Nairn said when questioned about his gay fan base. "I've never hidden my sexuality from anyone, my whole life in fact, and I've been waiting for someone to ask about it in an interview, (because) it's not something you just blurt out. I've tried to lead the questions a few times, to no avail!"  Now that the moment has come, Nairn was more than happy to "come out" in the media.  "I had an upbringing to respect other people's privacy, and their right to be and choose what they want, and I expectno, demandno less for myself," Nairn continued. "It's a very small part of who I am on the whole, but nonetheless, in this day and age, it's important to stand up and be counted. I have and always will stand my ground."  Nairn told Winter Is Coming that the crew on HBO's fantasy series "have been great," and he's quite appreciative of the gay community's support.  "I am aware of it," he said of his LGBT fans, "and I think it's really lovely. There's not a day that I don't get a few messages, but 99% or more are supersweet and nothing smutty at all!" Nairn said. "Again, it's a privilege, and I really mean that."  Nairn will return with the rest of the "Game of Thrones" cast in April, when season four bows on April 6.  "I never dreamed things would have turned out how they have," he said of the success of the show. "Things seem to keep happening that I constantly have to check myself and think 'Really? Is this real?' I knew Hodor would be a popular character ... but I didn't think to the level he has so far! I love the guy, I can see why people like him. It's a testament to (author George R.R. Martin, who wrote the books the series is based on) and the show that they can make every character so wonderful."

 Unfashionable Blackpool will be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea next season after beating Cardiff City 3-2 in the Championship playoff final at Wembley on Saturday.  The club from a famous English seaside resort attract home attendances of less than 10,000 fans to their tiny ground and only sneaked into the playoffs on the final weekend of the regular season.  But inspired by coach Ian Holloway, they fully deserved victory after a pulsating first half in which all five goals were scored.  "I'm so proud, not just for my team but for the area we come from," Holloway told Sky Sports.  "I cannot tell you what a difference this is going to make for the people in Blackpool.  "They're going to get so much money now from the Premier League. I can't put this into words. I'm bursting with pride."  Cardiff striker Michael Chopra gave them an early lead, but Blackpool's star player Charlie Adam equalized with a stunning free kick almost immediately.  Despite having the vast majority of possession, Blackpool fell behind for a second time when Joe Ledley finished off a neat passing move.  But the Seasiders quickly equalized again through Gary Taylor-Fletcher, who had hit the post just before heading the ball home after a corner.  To end a frenetic half, veteran striker Brett Ormerod forced home what proved to be the winning goal.  David Jones' men pushed hard for an equalizer after the break and Chopra hit the crossbar from outside the area while Ledley headed just wide, but Blackpool held on for a famous victory.  The club are best known for their exploits in 1953 when the legendary Stanley Matthews inspired their victory in the FA Cup final.  But backed by Lavtian millionaire Valeri Belokon, Blackpool have climbed from the third flight of English football to the elite in just four years and now stand to see their coffers boosted by 90 million ($130 million) in revenues from the lucrative Premier League.  For this reason, the Championship playoff is often billed as the richest match in football. Newcastle and West Bromwich Albion were already promoted to the top flight after claiming the automatic promotion spots in the regular season.  
 The International Olympic Committee (IOC) have opted not to re-award the women's 100m gold medal at the Sydney Games in 2000, which was stripped from Marion Jones two years ago.  In line with IOC practice, controversial Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou, who finished second to Jones in Sydney, would have been expected to receive the gold medal.  Instead, the record books will show no gold in the women's sprint at Sydney but two silvers, with third-placed finisher Tanya Lawrence of Jamaica promoted to silver alongside Thanou.  Lawrence's compatriot Merlene Ottey was awarded a bronze medal instead of fourth place.  It is believed to be the first time in the modern history of the Games that an Olympic event will not have a gold medallist.  "The actual awarding of a gold medal, of any medal, is certainly not a right and therefore in this case it will not happen," IOC spokesman Mark Adams told reporters.  Adams underlined Thanou's more recent problems, notably evading anti-doping tests in 2004, in which, "she disgraced herself."  "It's felt that with her conduct she didn't deserve to be honored with this recognition," he said.  Jones' 200m gold went to Pauline Davis-Thompson of the Bahamas with Sri Lanka's Susanthika Jayasinghe moving up into second and Jamaica's Beverly McDonald stepping onto the podium with bronze.  Jones was stripped of all her medals she won nine years ago after admitting doping offences, and was sent to prison in the United States after lying to federal investigators.

Los Angeles He was one of the most recognizable and influential voices in rock n' roll, and he never sang a note.  So in the wake of Dick Clark's death, Americans of all stripesincluding music iconsshared memories throughout the night and into Thursday.  It wasn't just that Clark first introduced the world to likes of Buddy Holly and James Brown as host of the influential "American Bandstand." It was that his fresh-scrubbed, boyish image and enthusiasm bridged a racial and political divide, making it OK for America's youth to listen to music that often troubled its older generation.  It is what really made him "America's oldest living teenager," a moniker he earned thanks to his youthful appearance.  Voice silenced  Clark, 82, suffered a heart attack Wednesday while at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica for an outpatient procedure, his publicist Paul Shefrin said. "Attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful."  The family has not yet decided whether there will be a public memorial service for the multifaceted Clark, although Shefrin said, "There will be no funeral."  'America's oldest teen' Dick Clark dies  In December 2004, Clark suffered what was then described as "a mild stroke," just months after announcing he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.  That stroke forced Clark to cut back on his on-camera work, including giving up the hosting duties for the "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve" specials. He appeared briefly as a co-host with Ryan Seacrest on December 31, 2005.  Clark anguished each year over whether to continue appearing on the annual show because of limitations on his speech from the stroke, U.S. Rep. David Dreier, a longtime friend, told CNN Wednesday.  Opinion: The smooth, unstoppable Dick Clark  "But then he would get deluged by people who were stroke victims and other people who had infirmities and they were such admirers of his fighting spirit," said Dreier, R-California.  Broadcast pioneer  Born Richard Wagstaff Clark in Mount Vernon, New York, on November 30, 1929, he began his broadcast career working at a radio station managed by his father.  Clark's "American Bandstand" began as a local TV show in Philadelphia in 1956. The show was picked up by ABC and broadcast nationally a year later.  By 1958, it was the show to watch, with 40 million viewers tuning in to learn about the latest in music.  "If you didn't go on 'American Bandstand,' you hadn't made it yet," singer Aretha Franklin told CNN's "AC360."  The savvy entrepreneur was a pioneer in introducing African-American groups and other performers to millions of young TV viewers.  His audiences were among the first integrated on television.  In 1960, the Ku Klux Klan sent death threats to Clark when he brought his short-lived "American Bandstand" spinoff "The Dick Clark Show" to Atlanta. The National Guard was called in to protect the show and its integrated audienceblack and white teens.  "Dick understood the connection that music had. It wasn't about black, it wasn't about white," Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men told "Piers Morgan Tonight."  While "The Dick Clark Show" lasted only a few seasons, "American Bandstand" continued to be a staple in living rooms across the country.  Clark's image was dealt a blow in 1959 that nearly derailed his career when he got caught up in Congressional hearings into payola, the practice of record companies paying money or making extravagant gifts to radio stations to play their artists' albums.  He admitted to taking gifts, but never money, according to news reports at the time. Clark survived the hearings, but he was forced to end his involvement with a record company.  As rock n' roll came of age, Clark played an influential role in shaping music careers, from Ike and Tina Turner to the Beach Boys to Madonna.  "Only God is responsible for making more stars than Dick Clark," said singer Tony Orlando, who was 16 when he first appeared on Clark's show in 1961.  Clark hosted the show until 1989. It was canceled a few months after he left the show.  Cultural icon  "American Bandstand" has long been considered the forerunner to musical shows, lending its blended format of musical performances, easy banter and interviews to such staples as "Soul Train" and MTV's "TRL."  It also gave way to the birth of Clark-esque television and radio hosts.  Seacrest, in a statement to CNN, expressed his deep sadness for "the loss of my dear friend Dick Clark."  "He has truly been one of the greatest influences in my life," Seacrest said. "I idolized him from the start, and I was graced early on in my career with his generous advice and counsel. When I joined his show in 2006, it was a dream come true to work with him every New Year's Eve for the last six years."  Friends, admirers mourn Dick Clark  Another major figure on the music scene was too upset to talk about Clark's death. Radio host Casey Kasem's wife, Jean, told CNN that Clark served as substitute host for Kasem's popular "American Top 40."  "We just feel that he was one of the most magnanimous human beings that we ever knew in the industry," she said.  Clark became wealthy as a businessman, producing successful TV shows through Dick Clark Productions. He created the American Music Awards in the 1970s, a competitor to the Grammy Awards.  He sold the company to Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder in 2007.  "One of the real draws when we purchased Dick Clark Productions was the opportunity to build on the tremendous foundation of programming that this icon of American broadcasting created," Snyder said.  "I got to know Dick over the past five years, and he was just as personable and warm in person as he was on television. Once you got to know Dick, it was obvious why he was so beloved by his fans. He was, in every sense of the word, a giant."  Clark also hosted numerous other television favorites, including the "Pyramid" game shows and "TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes."  "This guy was the best," said singer Freddy Cannon, who appeared on "American Bandstand" 110 times. "He helped me from the very bottom of my career all through the '80s and the '90s, and he's going to be missed a lot."  Former CNN talk show host Larry King said Clark's secret for success was his ability to be natural on camera.  "The hardest thing in the business is to be yourself, and no one knew that better than Dick Clark," King said.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Clark in its nonperformer category in 1993.  Singer Donny Osmond said Clark was one of a kind: "If someone cannot fill your shoes, you are a legend. And Dick Clark was a legend."  Clark's passing follows by less than three months the death of another TV dance show icon, Don Cornelius, the creator of "Soul Train." Cornelius was found dead of what authorities said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Los Angeles February 1. He was 75.  Clark, who was married three times, is survived by his wife, Kari, two sons and a daughter.  This story was reported by CNN's Alan Duke, Denise Quan and JD Cargill in Los Angeles, and written by Chelsea J. Carter from Atlanta.  
 Toulouse, France The suspect in a deadly shooting spree at a Jewish school in France knows he is being hunted and might carry out another attack, Paris Chief Prosecutor Francois Molins warned Tuesday.  He said the killer is "very determined" and has committed premeditated murders, targeting victims based on their race or religion.  "The criminal is anti-Semitic or terrorist," Molins said. "One does not exclude the other."  The shooting on Monday was the third fatal attack on minorities in southwest France in eight days.  The region remains on scarlet alert, the highest level in France, after a teacher and three childrentwo of them his own young sonswere gunned down Monday at Ozar Hatorah, a Jewish school in Toulouse. The other victim, the daughter of the school's director, was killed in front of her father.  In Monday's incident, a man wearing a motorcycle helmet and driving a motor scooter pulled up in front of the Jewish school just before 8 a.m. and started shooting, authorities said. He shot his victims in the head, local journalist Gil Bousquet said.  The gunman then fled, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said. The same method was used in the earlier soldiers' shootings.  One of the guns used Monday was also used in the killings of French soldiers of North African and Caribbean origin on March 11 and March 15, said Elisabeth Allannic, a spokeswoman for judicial authorities in Paris.  The first victim was a 39-year-old man, shot in Toulouse, while the other two were 24 and 26, according to French authorities.  A court in Paris has opened an investigation into the three killings, under anti-terrorism powers.  It is the first time a scarlet alert has been declared, French media reports say. The status means the state can implement sweeping security measures to guard against an imminent threat of major terrorist attacks.  Measures include increased security at schools, heightened surveillance of Jewish and Muslim sites, restrictions on traffic and access to public buildings, additional police on duty and extra scrutiny of passengers and baggage on public transport, the local Haute-Garonne authorities said Monday in an online statement.  France, with one of the largest Jewish populations in Europe, had 389 reported acts of anti-Semitism in 2011, according to the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, known by the French acronym CRIF.  The group issued a statement saying that while it is too early to determine definitively the motive for the crime, it appears to be a case of anti-Semitism. It called for increased security at places of worship and study as the investigation continues.  Exceptional measures have been put in place to find the suspect as soon as possible, Molins told reporters in Paris. Investigators must verify witness accounts and analyze some 7,800 hours of surveillance footage, he said.  The witness accounts indicate that the criminal is slim and around 1.75 meters tall (5 foot, 9 inches), he said.  All the victims were shot in the head at point-blank range, he added.  Interior Minister Claude Gueant said authorities are investigating the possibility that neo-Nazis may have been behind the attacks.  The gunman wore a camera on his chest during the attack, Gueant told Europe 1 on Tuesday.  The minister said a witness told authorities about the device, but it was not clear whether it recorded the crime, Gueant said.  France observed a minute of silence in memory of the victims on Tuesday morning, with President Nicolas Sarkozy marking it at a school in Paris.  "This happened in Toulouse, in a religious school, to children from Jewish families, but it could have happened here," he told the students. "It could have been the same assassin. These children are exactly like you."  Fear, confusion on streets of Toulouse  The bodies of the four victims arrived at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, said an official with the Consistory of Paris, a group representing Jewish communities.  Sarkzoy and Joel Mergui, the president of the Consistory of Paris, were present to receive them.  The bodies were to be flown late Tuesday to Israel and buried Wednesday morning in Jerusalem.  Sarkozy wrote Monday to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express his condolences for the loss of the victims, three of whomthe teacher and his sonsheld dual Israeli-French citizenship.  The teacher was born and raised in Bordeaux, in southwestern France, but pursued his religious studies in Israel. He married and had children before returning to teach at the Toulouse school, the consistory said.  The decision to send the bodies to Israel was made because of their faith rather than their nationality, the consistory said. As practicing Jews, their burial in the birthplace of Judaism ensures that their remains will not be tampered with, it added. Forty percent of French practicing Jews are buried in Israel, the consistory said.  Sarkozy, who is running for re-election, suspended his campaign in light of the wave of violence against minorities.  France has a complex history with the far right.  There has been steady if minority support for the National Front party founded by Jean-Marie Le Pen and now led by his daughter, Marine. The senior Le Pen came in second in the 2002 presidential elections, and his daughter is a candidate this year.  Sarkozy himself said in an interview earlier this month that France has too many immigrants.  "Our system of integration is working worse and worse, because we have too many foreigners on our territory and we can no longer manage to find them accommodation, a job, a school," he told France 2 TV on March 6.  Historian and author Patrick Weil told CNN it is likely that public shock over the attacks will calm the campaign rhetoric directed at minorities.  Security heightened in U.S. synagogues  Police in New York, Washington and San Francisco increased patrols of synagogues and Jewish institutions, with New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly citing fears someone might stage a "copy-cat" attack. But he and the city's mayor stressed there was no "specific" intelligence indicating an active threat.

Shortly after Salwa Bugaighis posted the names of three security force members killed in Benghazi on Wednesday on her Facebook page, she became the fourth person to die in the Libyan city that day.  Bugaighis, one of the most prominent faces of Libya's 2011 revolution, was shot in the head in her own home. Local media reported she had also been stabbed several times.  Bugaighis' husband, Issam, was thought to have been with her in the house and is reported missing. Friends and family believe he was abducted by the attackers.  Bugaighis was a lawyer, a human rights and women's rights activist, and one of the first Libyans to take to the streets of Benghazi in February 2011 to protest against the regime of Moammar Gadhafi.  Her assassination came hours after she cast her ballot in the country's second parliamentary election since the revolution. Photos of her voting were circulated on social media within moments of the news of her death.  "The shocking, ruthless killing of Salwa Bugaighis robs Libyan civil society of one of its most courageous and esteemed figures. But sadly she is by no means the first activist struck down during the political violence that has plagued the country since the uprising and in its aftermath," said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa deputy director.  "The Libyan authorities must do everything possible to ensure that Salwa Bugaighis' death is fully, independently and impartially investigated and that anyone responsible is held to accountsomething they have patently failed to do in previous political killings."  'True Libyan patriot'  Messages of support and mourning came from around the world.  "Outraged by senseless murder of Salwa Bugaighis. She was a courageous and inspiring leader. We join the Libyan people in mourning her loss," White House national security adviser Susan Rice said in a tweet.  Deborah K. Jones, the current U.S. Ambassador to Libya, wrote on her Twitter account: "A cowardly, despicable, shameful act against a courageous woman and true Libyan patriot. Heartbreaking."  British Foreign Secretary William Hague also tweeted: "Shocked and saddened by the killing of Salwa Bugaighis who was a passionate campaigner for the ideals of the revolution in Libya."  In a moving tribute, Human Rights Watch's Peter Bouckaert said: "On Wednesday, following countless threats against her and her family, Salwa was assassinated, shortly after she voted in Libya's parliamentary election. With Salwa's death, the original idealism of the 2011 uprising that overthrew Gadhafi's tyranny has received another crushing blow, and many Libyan women have lost a role model."  Campaign of violence  Over the past two years, the security situation in Benghazithe cradle of Libya's revolutionhas seriously deteriorated.  Bombings, kidnappings and killings have become near daily in a campaign of violence that has mainly targeted members of the security forces. Judges, activists and journalists have also been attacked.  No group has claimed these attacks, but officials and Benghazi residents blame the violence on Islamist extremist groups that have grown in size and influence since the fall of the regime.  Last month, Libyans mourned another known figure, an outspoken critic of extremist groups, newspaper editor Muftah Buzeid was shot dead in broad daylight while driving in Benghazi.  Three years after being one of the first voices of the uprising and a founding member of the country's first governing bodythe National Transitional CouncilBugaighis had continued to work to establish a better country and achieve the goals of the revolution.  More recently, she had been a member of the preparatory committee for national dialogue, working to bring together Libyans divided along regional, tribal and ideological lines.  Despite the increasing threat from radical groups, Bugaighis continued her activism and remained unveiled in a city where only a few dared to.  "We believe that Salwa Bugaighis may have been targeted for both her political activism and her role in promoting women's rights," said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui.  Libyans across the country took to social media, sharing their shock, grief, and anger. An online petition was started calling for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.  "Salwa was always present, at those early demonstrations where she would march at the front and whisper to me, we're not going to let them put us (women) at the back or in separate lines " said Huda Abuzeid, a friend of Bugaighis.  "She was always present, working tirelessly to support national dialogue and rule of law and still marching. An original leader of the revolution, a proud mother, an inspiring woman and supportive generous friend, she was charismatic, outspoken and fearless and she was always here."  Election day  In a tragic postscript, Bugaighis plotted her final hours on her Facebook page. She began the day urging her fellow Libyans to go out that day and vote.  "The blood of our martyrs will not prevent us from exercising our constitutional duty for the nation," she wrote. She then posted three photographs of herself voting at a polling station in Benghazi.  The country's new parliament is to be based in Benghazi despite the recent uptick in violence after a retired military general and his loyalist forces reclaimed the city from Islamist militants.  Benghazi was also the city where U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed by suspected Islamists in the U.S. Consulate in September, 2012.  Election day in Benghazi bought more violence, with Bugaighis posting photographs from her roof showing smoke rising in the distance from what she thought was a nearby international school after being hit by gunfire.  She later rang in to Libya TV and described the sound of fighting near her home as militants fought with the military. Gunfire could be heard in the background.  'More than just words'  Family members and friends said Bugaighis and her family moved overseas early this year. She and her husband only returned recently to the city.  "What now? Does she become just another poster to carry? Another name lost? Another death that we owe a debt to? That's all I will hold onto now ... we have a responsibility that those who murdered her, in her own home will not be the winners," Abuzeid said in a Facebook post.  "Because we will not, cannot, let those murdering cowardly scum write the end of this story ... That's what we owe Salwa, Salwa who went back to Benghazi and amidst the fighting went out and took part and voted, who spoke out, who worried about those being killed, who did more than just talk," Abuzeid wrote.  "She did her part and however much it pains us, anything other than carrying on and doing our part is a betrayal to her and all those who have died ... her family, Libya and she deserve more from us than just words ..."  Libyan communities overseas are planning several memorial events this weekend.  
 The world is facing an increasing risk of "irreversible" climate shifts because worst-case scenarios warned of two years ago are being realized, an international panel of scientists has warned.  Drought, flooding, storms and mass extinction in the future will have a heavy social cost as well.  Temperatures, sea levels, acid levels in oceans and ice sheets were already moving "beyond the patterns of natural variability within which our society and economy have developed and thrived," scientists said in a report released Thursday.  The findings came at the end of a three-day conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, where nearly 2,000 researchers gathered to discuss climate change.  The group called on policy-makers to use all tools available to reduce dangerous emissions of greenhouse gases.  The current climate situation on the planet may be as severe as the worst-case scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which issued warnings in 2007 of a future beset by flooding, drought, storms and mass extinction of species.  In its report, the researchers also warned of potential social costs across the planet because of climate change.  Temperature rises above 2 degrees Celsius would lead to climate disruption for the rest of the century and disproportionately affect poor nations, the researchers warned.  "Recent observations show that societies are highly vulnerable to even modest levels of climate change, with poor nations and communities particularly at risk," the report said.  The conclusions of the conference will be presented to politicians when they meet in Copenhagen in December. It is then that leaders will discuss a new global agreement on greenhouse gas emission levels to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.

BAGHDAD, Iraq Five U.S. soldiers were killed Friday in a suicide bombing in the northern Iraqi city of Mosulthe single deadliest attack on U.S. troops in more than a year, the U.S. military said.  A suicide truck bomber breached the outer security barrier of Iraqi National Police headquarters in southern Mosul, and detonated his explosives, killing eight people and wounding 60 others, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. A U.S. soldier was also among the wounded, the U.S. military said.  The ministry said those killed include five Americans, two Iraqi policemen and an Iraqi soldier. At least two individuals suspected of being involved in the attack were detained, the U.S. military said.  It is the deadliest attack on U.S. forces since March 10, 2008, when five U.S. soldiers were killed in a suicide attack in Baghdad.  Despite a number of military operations in this volatile city during the past year, Mosul remains one of the most violent places in Iraq. Last year the U.S. military said Mosul was the last urban stronghold of al Qaeda in Iraq.  Mosul is the provincial capital of Nineveh and is about 260 miles, or 420 kilometers, north of Baghdad.  Watch a suicide bomb attack kills 5 U.S. soldiers   U.S. and Iraqi military forces plan to pull out of Mosul  to allow Iraqi police to control security in the city. But police are not quite ready yet, according to an Iraqi general.  "We need to bring the police to the required level. The deadline is the end of July, and it's not enough time to prepare the police," said Gen. Hassan Karim, commander of Nineveh operations for the Iraqi army. "(That) means we'll need U.S. forces to stay in Mosul."  CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report  
 BAGHDAD, Iraq  At least 42 people were killed and 154 were wounded in five attacks on a religious holiday Friday, an Interior Ministry official said.  Shiite Muslim women light candles early Friday at a shrine in the holy city of Karbala, Iraq.  The first four attacks, which together killed 36 and wounded 124, targeted Shiites; the fifth attack was against a Sunni target.  In the latest attack, a parked motorcycle bomb exploded in the marketplace of al-Khadra in a predominantly Sunni neighborhood of eastern Baghdad. Six people died, and 30 were wounded, the official said. The attack appeared to have targeted a police patrol; three of the fatalities were police, the official said.  But most of the carnage was directed at Shiite targets, with the highest single toll exacted in the northern city of Mosul, where a suicide car bomb exploded near a Shiite mosque as a funeral was taking place, killing 30 people and wounding 100, the official said.  In another attack, a roadside bomb exploded near a bus carrying pilgrims in the Sadr City neighborhood, killing three and wounding eight, the official said.  Also in Sadr City, a roadside bomb exploded near a car, killing one person and wounding seven.  And in eastern Baghdad, a car carrying pilgrims was targeted, killing two people and wounding nine.  Friday was the end of a Shiite Muslim celebration in Karbala celebrating the birthday of Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi, the last of 12 historic imams revered by Shiites. Pilgrims participating in such celebrations have been the target of similar attacks by Sunni Muslims.  According to the Oxford Dictionary of Islam, Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi "is expected to return at the end of time as the messianic imam who will restore justice and equity on Earth."  Last Friday, bombs detonated after prayers near five Shiite mosques nearly simultaneously, killing 29 people as they were leaving the mosques.  The attacks fueled fears that sectarian violence could be reigniting in the country and called into question the ability of security forces to safeguard the population as U.S. troops have taken a back seat to their Iraqi counterparts.  Though the number of casualties has dropped over the past year, Friday's attacks show that an insurgency capable of wreaking havoc remains.  CNN's Arwa Damon and Yousif Bassil contributed to this story from Baghdad.

Count Leopoldo Marcello is being an awfully good sport.  He's opened his home to tourists, guided them through its grand halls and pointed out the exquisite frescoes, the work of 18th-century Venetian painter Giambattista Crosato.  His visitors, in turn, are forcing him to pose in an antique clerical hat.  The relic is one of many possessions on display in the villa.  Marcello smiles amicably as his guests snap away.  Sequins, silk and lace  Earlier, the count gave me, and a group of 20 like-minded travelers, a tour of his estateCa'Marcello (Via dei Marcello 13, Levada di Piobnino, Italy, +39 049 9350340; apartment rental: $5,427 a week; tours from $7).  The space seems entirely too grand to simply house the count and his son, Jacapo.  The ballroom is plastered with 18th-century frescoes painted by the one of the most famous Italian artists of that century, Giambattista Tiepelo.  Mirrors are framed with eerily placid faces made from stucco.  Leopoldo and his son live in the villa, constructed by their ancestors in the 1500s. But in many ways it resembles a museum of bygone riches instead of an actual home.  One room features mannequins clad in sequinned, silk and lace gowns that once belonged to the matrons of the Marcello clan.  Relics from another eraincluding antique century hair pins and opera glassesspeckle the home.  Visitors can explore the surrounding 18th century park and garden; more than 968,000-square-feet of land presided over by an array of statues.  If that's not grand enough, you can rent a grand, 3,860-square-foot, four-bedroom apartment located in one of the villa's wings.  Those who really want a taste of the aristocratic lifestyle can book private meals with the Marcello family, avail themselves of the cook, or pluck fresh produce from the garden and make their own meal in the private kitchen.  And the counts are not only are they willing to wear funny hats, they'll also help arrange travel bookings around the Venetian countryside.  Cash-strapped counts  So why is the Marcello family, with a noble history that dates back 2,000 years to the Roman Empire, turning their 400-year old estate into a glorified B&B?  The answer is simple: money.  "We're not wealthy enough to live in this place as a home," admits Jacopo. "We need this activity to maintain it. Because of our visitors, we're able to do restorations year by year."  Ca'Marcello is one of nearly 150 villas in Italy's Veneto regionwhich includes Venice, Verona, Padua and Vicenzato have opened their doors to paying guests.  Last year, the group joined forces in a tourist-led cooperative called Villa Veneto.  The initiative was founded by Count Alberto Passi de Preposulo, a distinguished aristocrat with a well-trimmed white beard.  I met Passi de Preposulo at his home in Treviso, the 16th century Villa Tiepolo Passi (31030 Carbonera, Treviso, Italy, +39 0422 39 77 90; tours from $7, advanced booking required).  Clad in a dapper smoking jacket and custom-made loafers, he resembled a rather posh Santa Claus, especially as he was brandishing a jar of homemade quince jellythe ingredients sourced from his 3.2 million square feet landscaped garden.  He isn't the sort of man you'd imagine renting out his rooms to tourists or selling a place at his dinner table for a paltry 30 ($40) a head.  After all, he too heads up one of Italy's most respected clansone which recently celebrated its 1,000-year anniversary and whose family tree can be glimpsed painted on a wall inside the villa.  "Our money is finished," he admits, referring not just to himself but to the Veneto region's many landed gentry.  Aristocratic barista  I ask Countessa Carolina Valmaranathe owner of the 17th-century Villa Valmarana (Stradella dei Nani 8, Vicenza, Italy, +39 0444 321 803; apartment rental from $678 per week; tours from $7)what would happen if she didn't open her home to lodgers and tours.  She admits it'd be a predicament.  "These houses are so expensive to maintain. I actually know a friend that wants to sell it and she can't," she says. "They're very expensive and big and oldpeople don't want to buy them because they don't know what to do with them," she says.  Jacopo admits that if he didn't inherit his stately home, it wouldn't be something he'd invest in.  "I wouldn't buy a place like this nowadays because it's enormous," he says. "The spaces are really grand, and we're just two people living in 9,000 square feet. In that way, it's a strange life, but it is also a unique kind of life."  A few years ago, the countess decided to add a cafe and bar to the heritage status property and even took a degree course to qualify as a barista.  For the most part, she seems nonplussed about opening her historic home, which is adorned with baroque frescoes by celebrated father and son duo Gianbattista and Giandomenico Tiepolo.  "We have two apartments that we sometimes rent out to guests, but it's not like we're desperate to rent them; we like to do it. We have nice people that come to stay, people that are into art and love to be here."  Taxing times  So why are members of Italy's aristocracy struggling to afford the upkeep of their grand homes?  The counts have a number of theories.  Jacopo Marcello says his family's woes started after the Second World War, when nationalization stripped their land assets from 4,000 to 600 acres to support reconstruction and demobbed soldiers.  "Things changed, principles changed," he says.  "Now the aristocracy is just part of a big machine and every one of us needs to have a job to have a normal life."  Valmarana says a 2012 end to tax breaks for heritage homes also had a dramatic effect.  "Our taxes have gone up six-fold," she laments. "Though we do get rent, it all goes back into the house."  To ensure their preservation, the countess has to climate control the rooms in her house and complete constant repairs such as fixing a recent ceiling crack.  "The roof wasn't holding the four main doors properly," she recalls. Damage can endanger the frescoes, which already expensive to maintain.  Passi de Preposulo had a similar issue with a roof collapse at his villa.  He insists the money he makes from visitors is not lining his pocket, but goes solely into the upkeep of his estate, which, he points out, isn't merely his home, but an Italian landmark.  "I'm trying to protect this house, and the richness of our history, our roots, but it's expensive," he says.  
 One of two men accused in a Canadian terror plot appeared to criticize the charges against him during a hearing Wednesday in Toronto, saying they were based on imperfect criminal law, not Islam's holy book.  Chiheb Essegheier, 30, is accused in what authorities say was an al Qaeda-backed plot to target a passenger train.  He waived the reading of the charges against him during the hearing Wednesday, telling Justice of the Peace Susan Hilton that "all of these conclusions were based on the criminal code; it was not the holy book."  "First of all, my comment is the following, because all of those conclusions was taken out based on Criminal Code, and all of us we know that this criminal code is not holy book; it's just written by set of creations, and the creations, they're not perfect, because only the creator is perfect, so if we are basing our judgment ... we cannot rely on the conclusions taken out from these judgments," he told Hilton.  "It doesn't matter in this court," Hilton responded. "You save that for another court, speak to your counsels, take their advice from there."  The suspects planned to target a train crossing from the United States into Canada, according to a U.S. intelligence official and another government official.  It was aimed at the New York-to-Toronto line that runs through Buffalo, another U.S. official said.  Once the explosives went off, two of the officials said, the train would have careered off its tracks, causing major destruction.  Instead, the suspects are behind bars after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced their arrest Monday.  Alleged co-conspirator Raed Jaser is "in a state of shock and disbelief," his lawyer John Norris said after his court appearance. He said his client is a permanent resident in Canada and has lived there for 20 years.  "He is anxious to see the evidence that the (government) says that it has against him," Norris said Tuesday.  Both suspects face charges of conspiring "to murder persons unknown ... for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a terrorist group," court records show.  Authorities have not released much detail about the men, including their nationalities or how long they'd been in Canada, beyond that they were not Canadian citizens.  University of Quebec spokeswoman Julie Martineau said Essegheier has been a doctoral student at the school since 2010.  He was a student at the National Institute of Scientific Research and was conducting research on nanosensors, which are used primarily for medical treatments or to build other nanoproducts, she said.  The suspects watched "trains and railways in the greater Toronto area" and intended to derail a passenger train, said Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Jennifer Strachan.  The Canadian Broadcasting Corp., quoting "highly placed sources," reported that both had been under surveillance for more than a year.  The FBI worked with Canadian authorities during the investigation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.  The terror plot, which a Canadian police official said on condition of anonymity wasn't linked to last week's deadly Boston Marathon bombings, was in its planning stages and not imminent.  Still, the outlines are reminiscent of those found in a document seized during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.  The document indicated that al Qaeda members discussed as early as 2010 a plan to derail trains in the United States by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and in valleys, a law enforcement official told CNN in 2011. No specific rail system was identified, according to the source.  Authorities believe the suspects received "direction and guidance" from elements of al Qaeda in Iran, said James Malizia, assistant commissioner for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  There's no evidence that the Iranian government was involved, he said.  Iran denies that al Qaeda has any presence within its borders.  Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi told the country's state-run IRNA news agency that the allegation is "the most ridiculous thing" he has ever heard.

Author John Updike, regarded as one of the greatest and most prolific writers in modern American letters, died Tuesday, his publicist said. He was 76.  John Updike won many literary awards. His books, such as "The Witches of Eastwick," were also best-sellers.  Updike passed away Tuesday morning after battling lung cancer. He lived in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts.  "He was one of our greatest writers, and he will be sorely missed," said Nicholas Latimer, vice president of publicity at Updike's publisher, Alfred A. Knopf.  Updike was a rarity among American writers: a much-esteemed, prize-winning author whose booksincluding "Rabbit, Run" (1960), "Couples" (1968), "The Witches of Eastwick" (1984) and "Terrorist" (2006)were also best-sellers. Updike won the Pulitzer Prize twice: for "Rabbit Is Rich" (1981) and its successor, "Rabbit at Rest" (1991). iReport: Share your tributes to John Updike  The "Rabbit" series, about an angst-ridden car dealer in a town much like Updike's hometown of Shillington, Pennsylvania, spanned four novels, a novella and four decades. In the bookswhich also included 1971's "Rabbit Redux" and a 2001 novella, "Rabbit Remembered"onetime basketball star Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom negotiates marriage, divorce, wealth and health problems, never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life.  "Rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection, but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood, and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking," wrote Time's Lev Grossman in naming "Rabbit, Run" to Time's "All-Time 100 Novels" list.  Updike was incredibly prolific, penning essays, reviews, short stories, poetry and memoirs. His works frequently appeared in The New Yorker, including a famed 1960 essay about Ted Williams' final game, "Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu."  "No writer was more important to the soul of The New Yorker than John," said David Remnick, the editor of the magazine, in a statement. "Even though his literary career transcended any magazinehe was obviously among the very best writers in the worldhe still loved writing for this weekly magazine, loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young.  "We adored him,"  Remnick continued. "He was, for so long, the spirit of The New Yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him."  The magazine said that Updike had written 862 pieces for it over the years, including 327 book reviews, 170 short stories and 154 poems.  He was well-regarded in his adopted home state of Massachusetts.  "John Updike's place among America's literary greats is forever secure, as is his special place in every Red Sox fan's heart for his magnificent 'Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,' " Sen. John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) said in a statement. "We honor his memory and his contributions, and Massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own."  Updike never won a Nobel Prize, but one of his characters, Henry Bech, received one in "Bech at Bay" (1998).  His works, particularly given their sexual content, could be as divisive as they were poetic. Many critics accused him of misogyny, and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matterand Updike put out his prose by the ream.  "It seems to be easier for John Updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book," the literary critic James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001.  But his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers, the cover of Time magazine (for 1968's "Couples") and a lifetime achievement Bad Sex in Writing award from Great Britain's Literary Review.  He was criticized by Norman Mailer, hailed by fellow author (and Updike obsessive) Nicholson Baker in "U and I" and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a "Simpsons" episode as the ghostwriter of a Krusty the Klown book.  "[I] was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of Springfield," Updike said, noting that the hardest part of his performance was "producing a chuckle."  John Hoyer Updike was born March 18, 1932, in Reading, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Shillington. From an early age he took to reading and writing, and earned a full scholarship to Harvard, where he headed the Harvard Lampoon. Upon graduation, he accepted a one-year fellowship to Oxford University in England. By the time he was 23, he had been offered a position at The New Yorker, which was to become his literary home over the next 50-plus years.  Updike's first novel, "The Poorhouse Fair," came out in 1959. The next year, in "Rabbit, Run," he introduced Angstrom, who was to become one of the most famous characters in American fiction.  When introduced, Rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife, the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life. Over the course of the "Rabbit" books, the character would routinely infuriate his spouse, mistresses and offspring, try to make things right, and never quite succeed.  His attitude didn't help. "Men are all heart and women are all body. I don't know who has the brains. God maybe," the character said in "Rabbit, Run."  "Rabbit, Run" was successful, as were Updike's other '60s books, including "The Centaur" (1963), which featured a teacher much like Updike's father, and the short story collection "The Music School" (1966). But it was "Couples" that made Updike a household name. The book, about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban Massachusetts, became a No. 1 best-seller.  Updike's interests ranged widely. He wrote about an African state in "The Coup" (1978). He discussed the relationship between science and religion in "Roger's Version" (1986). He revisited "Hamlet" in "Gertrude and Claudius" (2000). And he created a group of promiscuous witches in "The Witches of Eastwick" (1984), which became a hit movie in 1987 starring Jack Nicholson as the devil.  Though Updike's work routinely sold well, he was painfully aware of the decline of what's come to be called "literary fiction." In a 2000 interview with Salon, he lamented its difficulties.  "When I was a boy, the best-selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher's shelf. I mean, Steinbeck, Hemingway, some Faulkner. Faulkner actually had, considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are, quite a middle-class readership," he said. "But certainly someone like Steinbeck was a best-seller as well as a Nobel Prize-winning author of high intent. You don't feel that now."  And yet, Updike himself never lost his zest for the written word, and the pleasure brought by jotting, tuning, refiningcreatinga new story, even as the years drifted by.  "An aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that, as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them, will outlast him for a while," he wrote in AARP The Magazine late last year. "The pleasures, for him, of book-making ... remain, and retain creation's giddy bliss. Among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best."  Updike's most recent novel, "The Widows of Eastwick," came out in 2008. A collection of stories, "My Father's Tears and Other Stories," is due out later this year.  
 Luci Baines Johnson was just 16 years old when she approached her father, President Johnson, with what she considered a reasonable request.  Luci Baines Johnson, left, and her older sister, Lynda Bird, pose inside the White House in 1963.  "I asked my father if we could have the Beatles come to play at the White House," she recalled. "I was very excited about it."  His response? A decisive no, "without even any moment of trying to soften the blow," Johnson said in a recent phone interview.  The president thought the move would be viewed as self-serving. His daughter, however, saw it as a chance to honor "a great talent" and strengthen ties between the United States and Great Britainnot to mention a golden opportunity for her and her friends.  "I could see how different sets of folks could have either perspective. And I suspect my father could see that too," she said.  Luci Baines Johnson learned quickly of the scrutiny that came from being a first daughter. Her family moved into the White House in 1963, following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  Johnson was catapulted into the exclusive fraternity of White House families and embraced what she describes as a role she landed simply by chance. That fraternity has most recently expanded to include President Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia.  "I was an eyewitness to history, over and over, during my father's five years in the White House. And I wasn't elected to that option. I had no qualifications that provided me that privilege except an accident of birth," she said.  See famous first kids who grew up in the White House   Johnson speaks fondly of the opportunity she was afforded to dine with kings and queens, meet the movers and shakers of her time, engage with the body of America and hold a front-row seat to history. While most of her memories fall into two categories"the fond personal memories" and "the fond memories of public privilege"there's one in particular that was a combination of both.  "My 17th birthday, I received a handwritten note from my father, the only handwritten note I have, telling me how much he loves me and how much he has delighted in having me as his daughter for all those 17 years," she said.  The note was dated noon, July 2, 1964.  Six hours later, in the East Room of the White House, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination based on race or gender in public places, schools and places of employment.  "Can you imagine ever receiving a more momentous, glorious, exciting, thrilling birthday present that lasted forever and ever than something like that, that would change the world for all time and make it a much more decent place? That took place on my birthday," she said.  Life in the White House, however, came at a cost. Johnson and the first children before and after her will always have to "pay a big price in terms of personal time," she said. More than 45 years after she moved into the White House, she still receives requests for interviews about the time she spent there.  But the public's interest in first daughters is nothing new. Fanny Hayes, for example, who was about the same age as Malia when she moved into the White House in 1877, was followed by the media until the day she died. "She was an American celebrity," said presidential historian Doug Wead.  While the interest in first daughters has stayed steady, the pressure on the children has intensified, said Wead, author of "All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families."  "It's like the Miss America contestit's a real dilemma for the daughter of a president. She's supposed to be gracious. She's mocked and ridiculed if she isn't pretty," he said.  When Chelsea Clinton was just 13 years old, for example, she was ridiculed in a 1993 "Saturday Night Live" sketch that declared her "not a babe." Actor Mike Myers later apologized, and the skit was cut from replays of the show.  Amy Carter, who was 9 when she moved into the White House, was also mocked for her appearance and for her poor manners, after she pulled out a book during a state dinner. Her parents enrolled her in public school, illuminating the already bright spotlight on her. An infamous photograph of her first day at school shows the young girl with her head hanging low, carrying a Snoopy book bag and surrounded by a swarm of paparazzi.  To this date, no other presidential children have attended public school.  But other presidential children have taken on power roles in their fathers' administrations. Anna Roosevelt, for example, was a "super aide" to Franklin D. Roosevelt during his last year in office, Wead said, describing her as a combination of a personal secretary and chief of staff, not to mention popular in the public eye.  And Alice Roosevelt, a fashion icon who was known to have quite the rebellious streak, also played a pivotal role for her father, Theodore Roosevelt. She went on an around-the-world junket for the purposes of American foreign policya move that diverted attention from her father's efforts to bring about a peace treaty in the Russo-Japanese War, Wead said. The president later won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on various peace treaties.  Under the administration that followed, William Taft's daughter became one of the unsung heroes of women's rights, Wead said. Taft credited his daughter, Helen, for helping to change his mind about women's suffrage.  But for all presidential children, Wead said, there remains a lifelong battle of seeking approval from their fathers while struggling to carve their own identities. Many presidential daughters have gone on to author books about their time in White House, in what Wead describes as an attempt to restore their fathers' reputations.  "It's like sitting in front of a big window ... and seeing a billboard with misspelled words on it. It's just irritating," he said. "And the writing of a book, if it doesn't change history, it is a purifying experience for the child."  Susan Ford Bales once told the San Francisco Chronicle that while in the White House, "I kept thinking, I want to be normal. But I can't be normal. .... Everyone was watching. It was like living out loud."  But Ford also cashed in on some of the perks of her high-profile position and took Alice Roosevelt's advice to "have one hell of a good time." Ford roller-skated through the White House, held her prom in the East Room and scored VIP treatment at concertsincluding a backstage pass to see Rod Stewart. (That move ignited the public's interest in her, sparking rumors that she and Stewart were engaged.)  Johnson said that some of the best advice she received while in the White House was to just recognize that she couldn't change things or make the attention go away.  "There are inevitably going to be moments when you feel like the pressures of the goldfish bowl seem unfair or more than you can bear, but so are the opportunities to learn, to understand, to grow, to love, to make friends, to witness," she said.  "I describe it as the best of times and sometimes the worst of times, but whatever the times, it was a time of extraordinary privilege."

As recent high-profile attacks at major companies like Facebook and Apple, major publications like the New York Times and Washington Post and the U.S. government itself have made clear, cyber-crime is a very real and growing concern for everyone.  The latest threat report from security firm McAfee highlights the need for vigilance on mobile devices and a change in how people and companies approach security.  Smartphones and tablets are increasingly hot targets for cyber-criminals, and the volume of mobile threats is growing much faster than it did for PCs. The amount of malware detected by McAfee on the devices in 2012 was 44 times what it was the previous year.  The company estimates that 95% of all mobile malware ever devised has been created in the past year alone, and the vast majority of that is made for the Android operating system.  But McAfee's worldwide chief technology officer, Mike Fey, warns against looking at the the number of threats targeting Android and assuming that other platforms are safer. Criminals are targeting the operating system partially because it is so open, and also because they tend to focus on the platform they think will be around the longest.  What makes these portable devices such juicy targets for criminals is that they are rife with personal and financial information. For example, many phones have banking features baked in, and criminals can use "Trojan horse" viruses to milk them dry using SMS services that charge per text.  Malware isn't even the biggest issue for mobile users at the moment, says Fey. Phone owners should be more concerned about visiting a site that will do something malicious on their behalf.  "A huge amount of mischief on the Internet happens without anything being downloaded," said Fey.  It's much easier to execute these kinds of scams on smartphones than on desktop computers. With small screens and pared-down mobile sites, cyber-criminals can create a legitimate-looking banking site and trick the person into entering personal information needed to access an account, such as an account number, password and mother's maiden name.  Many intrusions begin in this type of simple way, often with a bad link in an e-mail or on a social network or a webpage that directs a person to a compromised or malicious site.  "There's a reason why those old-school attacks keep getting used," said Fey. "They work."  The McAfee report found that the volume of suspicious URLs jumped significantly in late 2012, averaging 4.6 million a month. In addition to mimicking sites to phish for information, the links can download malware onto a mobile device.  That software can send private data like passwords back to the attackers, or it can add the computer to a botneta network of infected computers controlled by cyber-criminals.  The software is downloaded so quickly that most people won't even notice. It's no longer the case that a computer will feel sluggish if there's malware installed, points out Fey. Decent malware won't even be noticeable.  Apple and Facebook traced their recent breaches to similar incidents. Employees visited hacked sites for developers that installed malware on their machines. These hacks, along with Twitter's January breach that resulted in 250,000 user accounts possibly being compromised, were the work of Eastern European gangs searching for intellectual property or other information to resell, according to Bloomberg.  A recent report from security company Mandiant described what it believed to be a powerful computer-hacking operation in Shanghai run by the Chinese military. This alleged high-tech espionage targets U.S. companies in an attempt to steal trade secrets. The issue is so serious that the U.S. government released an extensive report on Wednesday that includes instructions for corporations on how to improve their security.  Regular people will not be immune to the problems plaguing corporations and governments, according to Fey. Once these weapons, such as malware, are out in the world, they spread. Attackers can steal the code written by one government and use it to go after other targets.  While the origins of recent attacks have been grabbing headlines, Fey warns against turning all of our attention to the "bad guys" instead of the systemic security issues on the companies' side.  "It's not about who's attaching you, it's about the fact that you're vulnerable," said Fey. He said putting a face on the cyber-criminals "makes it sound like you can go negotiate with an entity to stop them. That's never been the case with cyberattacks."  The current approach of discovering threats, then fighting them, has to change, according to Fey; he called it "a thousand percent unsustainable."  New threats are popping up constantly, creating a never-ending game of security whack-a-mole.  There are new highly sophisticated attacks that insert themselves below the operating system and can steal all a device's data before wiping it clean. Ransomware is on the rise, in which a criminal steals data or takes control of a computer or mobile device, only releasing their hold when they receive payment. A new attack called Blitzkrieg uses phishing schemes to install a Trojan, which monitors web traffic and scrapes banking information in order to transfer money out of the victims' accounts.  In order to address all these threats, Fey said, the industry needs to rethink security from the ground up, designing more secure products from the start instead of just constantly chasing threats.  "We have to take some of the most complex security issues and simplify them into easy-to-solve problems," he said.  
 Hong Kong In the last two months, eight people in Cambodia have died from bird flu, a rare but deadly disease causing concern among health authorities. Six of the victims have been children.  The H5N1 virus, known to be highly contagious to poultry, typically resembles the flu when contracted by humans. But it kills more than half the people it infects, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Of the nine confirmed H5N1 cases in Cambodia this year, only an 8-month old infant has survived. The infant had received medical attention early, said Dr. Ly Sovann, the Ministry of Health's deputy director for communicable diseases control in Cambodia.  The eight bird flu deaths in the last six weeksconsidering that Cambodia has had 19 reported deaths from the disease in the last 10 yearshas sparked increased surveillance efforts. Health officials are warning people to wash their hands often, to keep children away from poultry and to avoid eating sick poultry.  So far, the nine cases are not believed to be related, although most of them came from the southern region.  Bird flu research resumes, but not in U.S.  The eight H5N1 deaths in Cambodia occurred with a 15-year-old girl and a 35-year-old man on January 21, and a 2-year-old girl and a 9-year-old girl on January 28. In the next month, a 5-year-old died on Feburary 7, a 3-year-old girl died on February 13, a 2-year-old boy died on February 19, followed by a death of a 35-year-old man on Monday.  He came from the Kampong Cham province in central Cambodia and died after developing fever, coughing and difficulty breathing earlier this month.  The patients experienced symptoms such as coughing, fever, difficulty breathing, sleepiness and vomiting.  Bird flu does not usually pass from person-to-person, but the disease is closely monitored because of concerns that the H5N1 virus could mutate allowing to spread more easily among people.  "We conducted investigations and found that all the cases were transmission from the poultry," said Sovann. "There is no evidence of transmission from human to human at this stage."  All nine patients are believed to have been exposed to sick or dead poultry, according to health authroties.  H5N1 typically spreads between birds, but can jump to humans, especially if they're living in close proximity. The greatest risk of exposure to the virus is through the handling and slaughter of infected poultry.  "Home slaughtering and preparation of sick or dead poultry for food is hazardous: this practice must stop," said Dr. H.E. Mam Bunheng, the Cambodian minister of health, in a statement. "Children also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent them from playing with chickens and ducks."  Health teams are carrying out "enhanced surveillance" in the villages and communities where bird flu cases have been reported, according to the World Health Organization. Officials are also telling people with flu-like symptoms who have difficulty breathing to seek medical attention immediately.  The disease is transmitted through the infected bird's saliva, nasal secretions or feces. It can spread in markets or places where eggs and birds are sold in crowded conditions.  The recent cases prompted China to announce temperature checks on people traveling back from Cambodia, according to the country's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.  China had two deaths from bird flu this year. The patients, a 31-year-old man and 21-year-old woman died in mid-February in the southwestern area of the country. Both had close contact with birds, according to Xinhua, the Chinese news agency.  The only other country with a confirmed H5N1 case this year was Egypt, where a 36-year-old woman died in late January.  Mexico slaughters 1.2 million chickens infected with bird flu  
	 'The latest threat report from security firm McAfee highlights the need for vigil'
"Downton Abbey" has called it a season, and the concluding chapter had its fair share of the romance, births, deaths and scheming that make the show "must-see television" every week. That is, for everyone but Maggie Smith, it seems.  But for those of us who have been watching since the very beginning, this season was seven episodes of welcoming new characters and mourning the loss of a few fan favorites. Oh, and did we mention Shirley MacLaine?!  Production will soon begin on Season 4, but until then, here are our top five takeaways from Sunday's finale.  1. The end of Matthew Crawley  The end EVERYONE saw coming. It was reported months ago that main cast member Dan Stevens would be shutting the door on his time at Downton. It wasn't long after that news of a death in the Season 3 ender began circulating. For many, it was just a matter of putting two and two together. But for those who remained unspoiled, the car accident at the end of this episode may have come as quite the shocker. The end had come for heartthrob Matthew Crawley. After this, and the earlier death of Lady Sybil, it appears no life is brought into the world of Downton without the loss of another. Yes, Mary gave birth to her first sona child who will never get to know his father. The family dynamic at our favorite Edwardian country home certainly has changed since the start of the Roaring '20s. We now have a widow, widower, two young children and a teen occupying space at Downton. How will the family come to terms with the loss of Matthew? How will Cousin Isobel deal with the death of her only son? Will Lady Mary find love again? One can only hope the next season explores this hardship instead of jumping a year or two ahead.  2. Romance is in the air  Almost everyone at Downton faced love life developments before last night's credits rolled. Lady Edith appears more interested in following her heart than her mind as she warms up to the advances of her married editor, Gregson. But is Edith willing to risk bringing scandal to Downton as "the other woman"? We'll have to wait for the next season to know for sure. Anna and Bates appear more in love than ever as they share picnics and let their hair down on their Scotland trip with the family. In the presence of the warring MacClares, Robert and Cora drew closer and shared a couple of tender moments. Even Mrs. Patmore and Isobel each found an admirer in this sprawling episodeor so they thought. It's not long before both those flames are put out, but it was a pleasant surprise seeing focus spent on the loves of our favorite supporting players.  3. Tom is still dealing with his upgraded social status  Tom did not join the Crawley clan on the Scotland trip, and decided to spend his time with the staff to keep from feeling alone. There was one employee in particular who caught Branson's attention: new maid Edna. Edna develops an attraction to the widower and proceeds to act on her feelings with a kiss. It doesn't take long for Carson and Hughes to catch onto the pair, and they fire the chambermaid before things can go any further. Tom is still reeling from Sybil's death and is still struggling with his transition from employee to family member. He wants to relate to both sides, but has to accept that he is leading a new life. Will Tom find a new mother for Baby Sybbie? Perhaps, but neither he nor fans may be prepared for that just yet.  4. The staff finally get out of the house for a spot of fun  It was nice to see the staff get some time off from their employers. It's not often we see this bunch out of uniform enjoying a little fun outdoors. The trip to the fair provided a chance for the gang to let loose. We also got a nice resolution to the Thomas-Jimmy conflict that plagued episode six. After Jimmy is jumped by a trio of men, it's Thomas who comes to his rescue! There may be a heart of gold hidden underneath those layers of lies and schemes that initially made Thomas so villainous. It's not long before Jimmy thanks Thomas and the two agree to be friends. Strictly platonic, that is.  5. Cousin Rose is here to stay!  That's right, much to many fans' dismay, we haven't seen the last of Rose. In fact, the rebellious teen will be moving in with the Crawley family as her parents travel to India. We suspect it's only a matter of time before the Dowager Countess grows tired of Rose's antics and has her killed off, but perhaps that's mixing confusion with desire. Either way, the latest lady to enter Downton is sure to stir up trouble, and we all know the Abbey can't run without a little scandal mixed in.  
 ISIS moved closer to seizing Kobani on Sunday as militants entered the southeastern edge of the Syrian city and street-to-street fighting began, a fighter and a media activist inside the city told CNN.  The city's defenders were looking for ways to escape the Kurdish stronghold strategically located near the Turkish border, the fighter said.  "It's the last chance to leave," the fighter said. The fighter and media activist requested their names be withheld for security reasons.  As night fell, the city grew quiet.  Members of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, called YPG, and other groups defending the city were unable to move because ISIS snipers were equipped with night vision equipment, the fighter said.  The fighter said many city defenders close to the Turkish border attempted to cross into Turkey, while other fighters closer to ISIS positions were waiting until the morning to make a move.  The importance of Kobani  ISIS has been trying to seize Kobani for weeks. The city is significant because ISIS wants to claim a swath of land running from its self-declared capital of Raqqa, Syria, on the Euphrates River to the Turkish border, more than 60 miles away.  On Sunday, ISIS fighters overpowered Kurdish forces to take the top and the eastern side of Meshta Nour, the strategic hill overlooking Kobani, said the sources, who both requested their names be withheld for security reasons.  A civilian source inside Kobani said there have been heavy clashes on all fronts around Kobani. He said ISIS forces had been moved back from a small corner of the city they'd held for two days.  The YPG said in a statement that 86 "terrorists" were killed during a 24-hour period and 17 YPG members died.  On Sunday, smoke billowed over Kobani as ISIS sent bombs into the middle of town.  U.S., allies stage airstrikes  Kobani is now tightly surrounded in a crescent from the Aleppo road on the southwestern outskirts of the city all the way to the eastern edge of Kobani, near the Turkish border, the fighter and media activist said.  ISIS is making inroads despite airstrikes by U.S. and allied forces, including Sunday's strikes on the eastern outskirts of the city.  The YPG destroyed an ISIS tank in the east of Kobani near Kane Kordan, a large mound on the eastern of the city, the civilian source said.  ISIS fighters are now about about one kilometer south on the Aleppo road, the civilian source said.  Turkish security force throw teargas  Conflict occurred outside Kobani when Turkish security forces fired tear gas canisters at Kurds gathered near the border to watch the fighting from afar, CNN's Phil Black reported.  Black said the security forces fired the tear gas when the crowds became restive or moved too close to the border. At least three canisters struck a CNN van, he said. Nobody was badly hurt and the crowds dispersed.  Pakistani Talilban supports ISIS  ISIS picked up support when Pakistani Taliban spokesperson Shahidullah Shahid issued a statement backing ISIS.  "The Muslims of the world look to you with great expectation and in this difficult time we your mujahidin brothers are with you and will provide you with fighters and help," the statement said.  Meanwhile, U.S. and allied military forces conducted three airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and six airstrikes in Iraq on Saturday and Sunday, U.S. Central Command reported.  In Syria, one strike northwest of Al Mayadin destroyed an ISIS bulldozer, two tanks and another vehicle, the military said. Two strikes northwest of Ar Raqqah hit a large ISIS unit and destroyed six firing positions.  In Iraq, four strikes northeast of Fallujah struck two mortar teams, a large ISIS unit and two small ISIS units, the military said. Three ISIS Humvees were destroyed with strikes near Hit and Sinjar.  Australians complete first air mission  Australia has completed its first air combat mission over Iraq, the government announced Sunday in a press release.  Two Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft conducted an air interdiction and close air support mission over northern Iraq and were on-call to attack targets if needed, the release said.  The aircraft did not use their munitions and returned to base to disarm, the release said.  CNN's Ingrid Formanek in Turkey and Yousif Basil in Atlanta contributed to this report.

You're wiped out, eating too much, your chest feels funny when you climb stairs, sex isn't working well, you can't wait for a drink and your spouse is looking at you warily. But you just bought health insurance online from a health exchange. Now, before you head for an ER, if only you could find a doctor...  Primary care doctorsthe pediatricians, family doctors and internists who constitute the foundation of our medical systemare also in trouble.  Over quite a few years now, their numbers and accessibility have fallen. So it's important to consider the likely impact on these frontline doctors when the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, goes into full effect. Could Obamacare help turn this trend around?  One thing is for sure. Obamacare has already accomplished something remarkable: No longer can previous illness or risk for future illness prevent an individual from obtaining health insurance.  But as the new health exchanges offer affordable insurance to more and more Americans, there is risk that a flood of new patients may overwhelm the already-besieged primary care work force.  The ACA incentivizes doctors, including specialists, to join and collaborate in "accountable care organizations" that contract with insurers to take responsibility for a defined population of patients. The goals are to contain costs, reward high quality care and help health professionals take care of more patients.  The idea is also to move away from today's "fee schedules" that pay doctors and hospitals far more for cardiac catheterizations or surgeries than for treatments with medications that may be just as effective. Such "perverse incentives" can lead to low quality care and high cost.  But the devil is in the details, and Obamacare doesn't have clear answers to some difficult problems.  Primary care doctors worry about measuring quality of care properly and rewarding different types of practice fairly, especially since the enormous disparities in income among doctors create resentments in the medical community. Some of the challenges ahead include:  How to measure quality  Techniques for measuring quality are improving, but there's a long road ahead before doctors agree on their scientific validity, particularly when quality scores may affect their income. How do you grade care for patients with hypertension, diabetes or high cholesterol levels? Numbers such as blood pressures, sugar or lipid levels tell only part of the story for individuals whose genes, cultural habits, psyches and social circumstances vary widely. Researchers are working hard to develop strong and replicable measures to measure quality, but this remains an enormous challenge.  How to pay for different groups of patients fairly  Every practice cares for a different mix of the healthy and the sick. Those who are ill consume more time and resources from doctors. Unfortunately, we don't yet have good techniques for adjusting compensation fairly for different mixes of patients. Payers don't really know how to compare the work of doctors caring for many sick patients, as opposed to those managing individuals who are generally well.  Income disparity among doctors  While doctors overall make far more money than most Americans, the ACA is unlikely to fix the extraordinary imbalance in incomes between primary care doctors and doctors who are subspecialists, particularly those who perform skilled procedures such as operations or colonoscopies. An equally skilled primary care doctor may spend hours helping a patient address the intertwined effects of diabetes, economic hardship and depression, but for that she or he is still paid far less than the surgeon who fixes a hernia or the dermatologist who removes an unsightly mole. That certainly doesn't raise the likelihood that students who graduate from medical school with enormous debt will choose primary care as a career.  Bureaucratic burdens  In part because of ridiculous bureaucratic requirements for paperwork and documentation, primary care doctors have so little time for their patients that they all too often shunt them off unnecessarily to specialists. Recent data suggest that of all the money paid for outpatient care, 75% goes to specialists and only 25% to primary care doctors, a ratio that's certainly a factor in the high cost of care overall.  Nevertheless, those in primary care, and especially young doctors considering careers in this complex and stimulating field, should take heart. Obamacare is supporting exciting new initiatives and pilot programs and spurring innovations that offer opportunities to make primary care more personal, more humane and more rewarding. Keep an eye out for the following: Growing benefits from electronic health records that over time will provide the foundation for vital improvements to our health care system, including remote access to records when a patient needs care far from home, and better real-time coordination among everyone involved in a patient's care. Communication between doctors and patients that is more transparent, bolsters patient safety and leads to improved clinical outcomes by involving patients (and often their families) more actively in their own care. (My particular obsession is to invite patients to read the notes we write, to share those notes with others and to join us in shaping their care collaboratively).  Opinion: Find out what your doctor really thinks about you New technologies and delivery systems that promote care in the home, such as video visits with doctors or nurses, and automated monitoring of glucose levels, heart rhythms or blood pressures, along with many new tools supporting self-care. Watch out for the evolution of "patient-centered medical homes" where teams of primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, mental health professionals, case workers, family caregivers, community-based patient navigators, volunteers and others who bring additional expertise to patient care work together to increase both the quality and efficiency of care.  The signs are promising for many of these new tools. At times, the path toward a better and more equitable health care system may feel slow and treacherous, but we should be hopeful. Nationally and at my medical school, we're beginning to see more young health professionals turning toward careers in primary care.  I think the tide is turning. I believe that Obamacare is delivering a child whose tentative steps and inevitable stumbles will be followed by strong strides forward.

 In the wake of the important decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to block mining in Alaska's Bristol Bay in order to protect the wild salmon population there, it's a good moment to take stock of the many dangers facing our world's waterwaysand our world's fish. It turns out the wild salmon of Bristol Bay are one of the five least toxic fish to eat around the globe and thankfully will stay that way, thanks to the Obama administration. But what are the other four? And why are the world's fish and water under such threat?  A range of abuses of the environment flow into each other in our world's oceans and lakes and rivers. There's marine pollution in which garbage is intentionally disposed of or carelessly dropped into our waters to such an extent that, for instance, in the north Pacific, there is actually a giant swirling vortex of garbage estimated to be the size of Texas.  Then there's climate change. Our world's oceans have already absorbed 80% of the additional global heat that has been added to our climate system and absorbed 33% of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted into the atmosphere.  Add to that over-fishing. With the world's fish supplies already cut down by environmental hazards, mass fishing technologies like bigger boats and bigger nets have cut the fish population even further, which in turn limits reproduction and natural repopulation.  A stunning three-quarters of the world's fish supply is being harvested faster than the fish can reproduce. And 80% of the world's fish have already been fully exploited or are facing perilous decline.  And then the fish that survive are sick. Water runoff dumps poisons like industrial PCBs, heavy metals, including mercury and lead, agricultural pesticides and sewage system effluents directly into our water. Fish eat or absorb that poison and when you eat the fish, those toxins are passed onto you, often at dangerous levels.  So what's an omnivore to do? Fortunately, there are good fishfish that are healthy to eat and responsibly caught in ways that are good for the health of other fish and our oceans.  According to SeafoodWatch.org, a helpful resource on these issues, healthy fish must have low levels of mercury and provide high levels of Omega-3s (the good oils our bodies can and should be getting from eating fish). Plus healthy fish are caught or farmed responsibly, which prevents endangered fish populationsyes there are manyand ensures that dolphins or other sea creatures aren't harmed by fishing nets.  So what are the best fish to eat? According to SeafoodWatch, in addition to Alaska's wild caught salmon (the salmon now thankfully preserved in Bristol Bay and beyond), you want to go with canned wild Alaska salmon, Atlantic mackerel and freshwater Coho salmon. Also... sardines, the subject of the video at the top of this story. Wild-caught Pacific sardines are plentiful and quick to reproduce and don't eat a lot of toxins during their short lives. And they can taste great, especially if you find larger filets and grill 'em up. Those are the best of the best.  SeafoodWatch also counts as healthy choices sablefish/black cod from Alaska and the Canadian Pacific, and troll- or pole-caught albacore tuna from the United States or British Columbia. And if you can't get these, there are less sustainable and only sorta-toxic options in between, but it's best to avoid the "dirtiest of the dirty" fish, which include imported catfish and shrimp, bluefin tuna and Chilean sea bass.  In general, stick with the fish on the healthy list, and you'll be doing your body and the planet a big favor.  Responsible fish eating won't solve all our ocean and fish problems around the globe. We still have to stop polluting the oceans and address climate change, which is hurting our nation's water. But for starters, one thing you can do when you go out to eat or cook at home is pick fish that are good for you and good for the planet. It's a simple and delicious step in the right direction.

"I don't know if organized criminals have the capability to do something to the Pope. But they are certainly thinking about it."  These words, uttered in a recent interview by an Italian anti-Mafia prosecutor, don't quite justify the alarming worldwide headlines they provoked, but at the same time it would be rash to dismiss them out of hand.  The new Pope represents a serious threat to some established criminal interests at a critical moment in the long history of the Mafias' relationship with Catholicisma past marked by both intimacy and violence.  Read more: Prosecutor says Pope faces mafia threat  Italy's Mafia problem is as old as the Italian state. The three major Mafiasthe Camorra, the 'Ndrangheta, and Cosa Nostraoriginated in the political violence that led up to Italian unification in 1860. But only in 1993 did a Pope explicitly denounce the Mafia. Speaking in Sicily, John Paul II warned mobsters that God's judgement was at hand. Cosa Nostra's own verdict on the Pope's words came two months later, when it planted bombs that seriously damaged two ancient churches in Rome.  Before that epoch-making rupture, mafiosi and priests had rubbed along pretty well. The reasons were political. The Church loathed the new Italian state because its unification had robbed the Pontiff of his earthly kingdom, leaving him only with the Vatican City. So the Church looked elsewhere for pious sources of authority. And Mafia bosses have always been good at dressing up as devout paladins of order.  The local saint's day, when a statue is carried through the streets amid prayers and singing, is the focal point of the calendar in many Italian towns and villages. All too often, the local capo would place himself at the head of the parade. The 'Ndrangheta even used a religious festival as cover for its annual general meeting. Since the 1890s, the bosses from across Calabria have gathered in early September at the Festival of the Madonna of Polsi.  During the Cold War, the Church stood firmly in the anti-communist camp. Mafia bosses had every interest in posing as bulwarks against the red menace because it helped them cosy up to the Christian Democratsthe Catholic political party that held power until 1994. In 1964, the Cardinal Archbishop of Palermo denounced any talk of the Mafia as a Communist plot to besmirch Sicily. In 1982, John Paul II visited Palermo in the middle of an underworld war that saw hundreds killed, and he did not once use the M-word.  Read more: Popular Pope but same old church?  So the Church was, at best, culpably silent about Italy's permanent Mafia emergency. Over that time, mafiosi learned to speak religious language and twist it to their own ends. The evidence is overwhelming: most Italian gangsters are believers.  During the making of a recent documentary for Italian television, I visited many of the fortified bunkers that 'Ndrangheta bosses have built in case they need to go to ground. Not one was without its crucifixes, its statuettes of saints, its paintings of the Virgin Mary.  I accompanied the carabinieri (military police) on a raid on a boss's villa that had been modelled on the house from the final scene of the movie Scarface. Not only was there a large effigy of the Madonna of Polsi outside the front door, but the interior was decorated with various religious trinkets that competed for space with samurai swords and replica machine guns.  Religion offers the Mafias a way to bind their organizations together, and gives them the feeling that they are extorting and killing in the name of a cause more noble than their own greed. The piety of the majority of Mafia affiliates is the ultimate proof of the truism that religion can be used to justify any cause.  So what changed? Why did John Paul II make his famous denunciation of the Mafia in 1993? There are two fundamental reasons. First, the end of the Cold War. And second, in 1992, the clamorous bombing assassinations of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, Italy's two leading antiMafia prosecutors.  Since then, the Vatican has entrenched its stance against the mob. An important symbolic gesture came earlier this year, when Father Pino Puglisi, a Palermo priest murdered by Cosa Nostra in 1993, was beatified.  Read more: Pope's embrace of disfigured man goes viral  Much remains to be done before the Catholic Church in its entirety can be said to have distanced itself from the Mafia. Priests are not always keen to dance to the new tune issuing from St Peter's. Some still preside over the lavish weddings that weld underworld dynasties together. Religious festivals are still subject to Mafia infiltration.  Pope Francis is determined that there will be no turning back. He used the beatification of Father Pino Puglisi as his cue to repeat John Paul II's denunciation of the Mafia from twenty years back. But the new Pope is also taking the battle against crime beyond the realm of words and symbols. The decisive terrain on which that battle will be fought is finance.  The Church is rich. But its finances are also bafflingly complex and utterly lacking in transparency. At the centre of its archipelago of financial institutions sits the Institute for the Works of Religion (or IOR)the Vatican Bank. It handles the money of many religious orders. But it also acts like a little piece of the Caymen Islands on the western side of the Tiber River, which is what makes it attractive to people who want to keep their wealth away from the prying eyes of the law.  The IOR has been tainted with scandal before. In 1982 it was implicated in the fraudulent bankruptcy of the Banco Ambrosiano, whose president, Roberto "God's banker" Calvi, was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London. Although his murder, or suicide, is still unsolved, it seems highly likely that he was laundering Cosa Nostra's heroin profits.  Most observers think that the Church's efforts to reform its finances in the wake of the Calvi scandal were desultory. Little changed. But now Pope Francis has hired external expertise to bring the IOR into line with international standards of transparency and probity. Just a few days ago he was particularly frank in condemning Italians who worship "the goddess bribe", and who give to charity while dodging tax.  Nobody knows how far the rot extends. Many suspect that the Mafias and sundry other shady cabals have for years been concealing money under the noses of bishops and cardinals. If Francis is really determined to carry through his clean-up, then likely as not there are plenty of people who would wish him harm.  So would the Mafia really murder the Pope? It is very unlikely. The Mafias rarely kill without first carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Even a rudimentary projection of the likely consequences of a hit on the head of the Catholic Church would show it to be a catastrophic own goal. A much more probable scenario is that the Church will carry on reforming its finances, but at its habitual leaden-footed pace. Meanwhile, the dirty money will be spirited away.  
 Princeton, New Jersey As he stood before the delegates of the 1964 Republican Convention in San Francisco, California, Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, the party's presidential nominee, said, "I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."  The delegates, who had booed New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller when he called for the party to respect moderation, were thrilled. Many of Goldwater's supporters were determined to push their party toward the right wing of the political spectrum. They felt that their party leaders, including President Eisenhower, had simply offered a watered-down version of the New Deal.  Yet Goldwater soon learned that extremism could quickly become a political vice, particularly to a party seeking to regain control of the White House. The right wing of the Republican Party in the early 1960s inhabited a world that included extremist organizations, such as the John Birch Society, that railed against communism.  The Birchers developed a huge network of local activists, reaching more than 100,000 members. They published pamphlets and books and threw their support behind local candidates. Some mainstream conservative outlets depended on supporters who were in these groups. Many right-wing organizations in the South were opponents of civil rights and advocates of racial segregation.  During the fall campaign of 1964, President Johnson devastated Goldwater and his running mate, William Miller, by painting them as an extremist duo with close ties to military hawks and racist demagogues.  Since Miller, a New York congressman, was known for his close ties to the right, Democrats could charge that Republicans had not balanced their ticket.  The "Daisy" advertisement had Americans look into the eyeball of a young girl as it reflected the image of a nuclear explosion. Another advertisement showed images of the Ku Klux Klan decked out in their garb and carrying burning crosses.  The ads played on statements by the candidates and extremist organizations. The narrator of the KKK ad reminded viewers that Robert Creel, grand dragon of the Alabama KKK, had said: "I like Barry Goldwater. He needs our help."  Democrats certainly had their extremists as well in the 1960s, as all the discussions about Bill Ayers and the Weathermen in the 2008 campaign reminded us. Yet in the 1960s, the Democratic leadership was removed from these elements of the liberal spectrum.  Indeed, radical left-wing activists were primarily revolting against what they saw as the bankrupt leadership of the Democratic Party.  They hated Lyndon Johnson even more than they hated Richard Nixon. Always nervous about being tagged by Republicans in a conservative era as too close to socialism, Democrats in Congress and in the White House since the 1960s have tended to distance themselves from fringe elements of the left.  Now Republicans are facing the danger of being associated with extremism once again. Last week, following the vote on health care, members of Congress have were the targets of death threats and vandalism.  In the final hours of the health care debate, there were reports about how health care opponents uttered racial slurs at Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis, a hero of the civil rights movement, and sexual epithets against Rep. Barney Frank, who is openly gay.  Sarah Palin sent out a statement on Twitter that urged followers, "Don't Retreat, Instead-Reload!" Palin explained later that her use of those words was not about "inciting violence," but rather about inspiring people to get involved in the political process.  Some ugly elements of the Tea Party movement, which have been held in check since the original Washington protest in September, have returned to the  political debate.  In the short-term, the Tea Party movement has helped to revitalize the Republican Party.  Without question, the kind of energy that has been fostered by the activists associated with these groups has helped Republicans mobilize their supporters and can clearly be helpful at bringing out the vote in the midterm elections.  By generating interest in the libertarian and anti-government arguments of conservatism, the movement will help keep conservatives motivated after their loss on health care. It is fair to say that many Americans who support this cause are simply expressing legitimate and deeply held antipathies toward Washington.  But extremism is there, and it has flared in the past few weeks. This kind of rhetoric will not produce long-term gains for the Republican Party. Realizing the threat, Republican leaders have begun to disassociate themselves from these elements of the movement.  There have been a few voices of condemnation, such as House Minority Leader John Boehner who said "violence and threats are unacceptable." Local Tea Party organizers have also stepped forward with words of condemnation.  Leaders from the Florida Tea Party said in a letter to President Obama that they stood in "stark opposition to any person using derogatory characterizations, threats of violence, or disparaging terms toward members of Congress or the president."  These statements are encouraging and strike the right note. Yet Republicans need to follow through by continuing to exert pressure on local organizational leaders to stamp out this kind of activity.  They must also avoid contradictory messages, such as the statement of House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, who accused Democrats of "fanning the flames" by using the incidents as a "political weapon." Cantor had a bullet fired at his campaign office after receiving anti-Semitic threats, but local police described the bullet as random gunfire not directed at his office.  The leadership statements must be unambiguous and firm, leaving no question in voters' minds that this is not what conservatism is about.  When Ronald Reagan ran for the presidency in 1980, he worked hard to weaken the connections that existed between Republicans and the fringes. He learned the lessons of 1964 and sought to remake a Republican Party that could appeal to mainstream America. Reagan realized that if he did not, the perception of extremism would pose a long-term threat to the party's future.  Now Republicans are facing the Goldwater threat once again. At the same time that conservatives have every right to oppose and challenge President Obama's agenda, they must make clear that there are limits and that the kinds of actions that we have seen in recent days are not something that either party will be willing to tolerate in the year ahead.

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday defended Obamacare against "a noisy minority" in Congress and described some Republicans' legislative tactics to defund the landmark program as "deeply distressing" and "bad politics."  "This president is not going to agree to defund health care," Clinton said at a health panel just before President Barack Obama was to make an appearance.  "If they want to vote to shut the government down, that's on their head and their responsibility and if they go even further, which is deeply distressing, and for the first time lead our country into default on our obligations that is not just partisan politics," Clinton said at the Clinton Global Initiative established by her husband, who was also in attendance.  8 answers on Obamacare and the shutdown  A default would go to "the heart of our credibility around the worldnot just our economic leadership but our political and strategic leadership," Clinton said. "So I hope our friends on the other side of the aisleand it's a minority, but it's a noisy minorityunderstands this is not right to do, and this is bad politics to do."  Later in the panel, Obama and former President Bill Clintonboth Democratsdefended the health care reform.  Obama said some Republicans' effort to resist the reformmaking it No. 1 on their agenda"is wrong."  Opponents of the health care law are trying to "scare" Americans about the program, Obama said.  "So what you have had is an unprecedented effort, that you have seen ramp up over the last month or so, in which those who have opposed the idea of universal health care in the first place, and have fought this thing tooth and nail through Congress and through the courts and so forth, arehave been trying to scare and discourage people from getting a good deal," Obama said. "And so some of you may have seen some of the commercials out there that are a little wacky."  Bill Clinton praised the health initiative, saying it will make Americans "healthier" in the next decade.  How long can Hillary wait?  
 Armed militants took over three police camps Saturday in northern Kenya, a siege that prompted a significant response by local and national authorities, a Kenyan agency said.  The attack was centered in the village of Lorokon in Turkana County, which borders Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north and a sliver of Ethiopia to the northeast.  Kenya's National Disaster Operation Centre tweeted that the siege comes on the heels of a border dispute between the Turkana and Pokot peoples.  "(Authorities) are combating the bandits in Turkana, but there is heavy resistance," the agency tweeted Saturday evening.  The Disaster Operation Centre followed up about two hours later by noting Kenya's Ministry of the Interior is coordinating the response, working in conjunction with local police officers and reservists.  Kenyan police were moved to the area "to combat the banditry and to reopen" a key road in the area. Efforts were also under way to work with leaders in both West Pokot and Turkana "to resolve the border dispute in Lorokon," the national agency said.  A curfew was established Saturday night in parts of both these counties.

Three weeks ago, Teleka Patrick disappeared.  The 30-year-old doctor in residency failed to show up for work on December 6 in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The night before, police 100 miles south in Indiana found her car abandoned but not crashed in a ditch off busy I-94.  Investigators searched but came up empty.  "We looked everywhere," Sgt. Rick Strong of the Indiana State Police told CNN.  Now investigators have more potential evidence, about 20 minutes worth.  Videos provide clues  Surveillance and home videos uploaded to YouTube provide clues about Patrick's movement in the weeks, days and hours before she vanished.  In a different context, the YouTube videos might be considered sweet or romantic. They feature Patrick talking, cooing and singing to someone unnamed and apparently unknown.  Patrick's mother told CNN she wasn't aware of any romantic relationship her daughter may have had. But the videos have an intimate feel to them.  "Hi, baby," Patrick says in one. "I am just coming to you to say 'hi' and tell you about my day."  In another video, Patrick shows a table set for two with omelets and pancakes.  "If you were here, this is what would be your plate," she coos.  The two videos were posted in early November. It's not completely clear why they only drew attention now.  A third video to surface comes from a local hotel in Kalamazoo. That's where Patrick went on the night of December 5, just hours before police found her car in that ditch.  At a little past 7:30 p.m., Patrick, dressed all in black, showed up at a Radisson hotel not far from the hospital where she worked.  She spent around 10 minutes talking with employees at the reception desk but ultimately left.  There's no audio on the video, and it's not clear why Patrick failed to book a room.  But at 7:48 p.m., she strode across the hotel's tiled floors, out the door and onto a hotel shuttle bus.  Those images provide the last known picture of Patrick.  Friends, family shocked  Patrick's disappearance has, from the beginning, drawn shock from many corners.  Her family says Patrick, who had just moved to Michigan, bought a plane ticket to come visit them for the holidays in Florida.  Her colleagues called her "part of our family of medical professionals."  And CNN's audience posted by the droves on iReport asking for coverage in the hopes that more information and coverage would propel the case forward.  The young doctor was described in comments as "wonderful," "beautiful" and "talented."  The newly discovered videos add to the swirl of questions surrounding this case.  Investigators have said they have no evidence of foul play, but they also don't have conclusive evidence that Patrick's movements on December 5 were voluntary.  Police brought out dogs to track Patrick's scent. They led investigators the 30 or so feet out of the ditch where Patrick's car rested to the highway. There, the trace went cold.  "We have scoured, searched and looked at everything we could possibly look atall the exits, all the businesses, all the hotels," Strong said. "We posted fliers; we talked to neighbors (who live near the highway). We did a full-blown, on-the-ground search in the wooded area north of where the car was."  Carl Clatterback, a private investigator hired by Patrick's family, told CNN that investigators are looking into the videos. A central question: Who is Patrick talking to in the videos and does that person know anything about what happened to her?  CNN's Tiffany Campbell contributed to this report.  
 The airline industry's latest tactic to increase revenuecharging premiums for window and aisle seatsis making it hard for groups to fly together, say passenger advocates.  George Hobica, founder of travel site AirfareWatchdog, said his organization had received a spate of complaints from Americans who had struck problems being seated together on flights. Complainants included a woman who had been unable to sit next to her husband, who had a medical condition.  He said the problems were arising as airlines set aside more desirable window and aisle seats for passengers who pay a premium, leaving those who do not pay with center-row seats, separated from other members of their party unless they have paid the surcharge.  "The airlines are basically trying to squeeze out more fees in the face of higher costs, and it is inconveniencing a lot of passengers," said Hobica.  The charges for window or aisle seats in the front half of the plane, costing as much as $29 each way on U.S. domestic flights and $59 on international flights, are the latest of a raft of passenger fees introduced in recent years as the airline industry looks to generate new streams of revenue.  See also: In-flight phone calls to become standard  The issue has arisen in the United States, where Delta, American Airlines, and low-cost carriers US Airways, Frontier, Spirit and Allegiant have implemented charges for "preferred seating." Delta spokeswoman Katie Hulme said the move reflected the fact that some seats were more desirable than others, and that it gave passengers greater choice and flexibility in where they were seated.  "Offering preferred seats for sale to all Delta passengers means that we are offering different seat selection options to enable more passengers to travel in their seat of choice," she said.  See also: Airline seat squeeze: It's not you  The notion of paying extra to reserve more desirable seating is catching on more widely across the industry. Across the Atlantic, low-cost Ryanair rolled out reservations for certain seats across all its routes in January, while its rival Easyjet has also been experimenting with the practice.  The implementation of end-of-row seat fees is part of a broader airline trend to charge for amenities previously included in the standard fare, such as movies, water, pillows and blankets.  In response to soaring fuel prices four years ago, airlines also began introducing charges for checked baggage, generating huge sums. But last year the revenue from checked bags for U.S. airlines fell for the first time, suggesting passengers were trying to avoid fees by packing light when they traveled.  Two U.S. airlines, Spirit and Allegiant, also charge passengers for carry-on baggage.  Hobica said part of the airlines' rationale was "to cater to the people that have paid the most for their seats."  See also: Seat-review sites put fliers in prime position  Kate Hanni, of passenger rights organization FlyersRights, said the aisle and window surcharges made air travel an even more daunting prospect for families.  "Families have already been having a hard time, so this is the icing on the cake," she said. "Can you imagine getting on a plane and not being seated next to your three-year-old?"  While gate staff would typically try to seat families together, removing aisle and window seats as options was making this impossible, said Hanni.  "The predictability of air travel has really gone away. This is one more layer where people can't predict what's going to happenit's a crap shoot," she said.  "They're holding the aisle and window seats out for higher pricesand trust me, this is just a revenue grab."  Hobica said while the new price structure was causing problems, he could understand the logic behind it. "When you buy a ticket to a Broadway show, you do pay more for better seating," he said. "If passengers were willing to pay higher fares at the beginning," he said, the problems could be avoided.  Hulme said that the number of rows in which window and aisle seats were set aside as "preferred seating" varied from aircraft to aircraft, but did not extend through the entire plane. Many of those who traveled in groups were leisure travelers who tended to book their fares in advance, and should encounter few difficulties being seated together, she said.

MADRID, Spain The world may soon know for sure where Spanish poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca rests after fascists executed him in 1936 during Spain's Civil War.  A team from the Andalucia Geophysics Institut at work in the Federico Garcia Lorca Park, Spain.  Officials in southern Spain Friday cleared the last legal hurdle to permit exhuming a mass grave site in a village near Granada where Lorca and some other Civil War victims are thought to be buried, CNN partner station CNN+ reported.  The area has been fenced off for weeks as scientists conducted preparatory work. Next Monday (October 19) they are due to erect a large tent over the site so that exhumation can be conducted confidentially, said Andalusia regional government justice councilor Begona Alvarez, CNN+ reported from Granada.  The potential exhumation of Lorca is part of a broader effort in Spain that already has resulted in various mass graves being dug up and could lead to thousands of other Spaniards still thought to be in mass graves.  Many were killed by right-wing forces loyal to General Francisco Franco, who won the three-year long Civil War, which began in 1936. Franco went on to rule Spain with an iron fist until his death in 1975.  For years, Lorca descendants have argued that Lorcawhose poems and plays are widely studied at universities, including his "Poet in New York"should not be exhumed, mainly so that he would not be seen as more important than the many other Civil War victims thought to be in nearby mass graves.  In a statement earlier this month, Lorca descendants noted the complexity of the issue, because relatives of some others thought to be in the gravesite have requested their removal, identification, and permission to bury their remains in hometown cemeteries.  In their October 2 statement, six Lorca descendants reiterated their request that Lorca's presumed remains not be disturbed. But they also reserved the right to have them identified in the future, and they asked authorities to designate the current mass grave site as a legally defined resting place.  It is already a park, in the village of Alfacar, because that's where it's long been thought that Lorca, captured by Franco loyalists early in the Civil War, was shot dead, according to historians who interviewed witnesses and local villagers.  Relatives of a bullfighter, Francisco Galadi, a tax inspector, Fermin Roldan and a restaurant owner, Miguel Cobo, have asked authorities to identify their remains, officials said.  But in the case of teacher Dioscoro Galindo, also executed and thought to be in the mass grave, two of his nieces are at odds over whether to exhume him or not, so officials will not act until that family reaches a common position, CNN+ reported.  Irish author Ian Gibson, who is a leading scholar on Lorca, told CNN last year, "Lorca is the most famous victim of the Civil War. I think Lorca can be a symbol for reconciliation of the Civil War."  Spanish parliament in 2007, led by the Socialist government, passed a law condemning Franco's dictatorship and calling on town halls to fund initiatives to unearth mass graves.  It also sought to honor Roman Catholic clergy and others executed by the losing side in the war, the forces loyal to the leftist Republican government.  Since then, some prominent statutes of Franco have been removed from public view, but others remain, along with numerous streets in Spain named for Franco or his top generals.  More recently, there have been efforts to try to exhume presumed Franco victims from a mass grave at his large mausoleum site, the Valley of the Fallen, just outside of Madrid, where Franco himself is buried.  
 A statement purportedly released by a violent Mexican drug cartel promises a one-month extension to a truce it called for in December.  The Familia Michoacana cartel, which takes its name from the central-coastal state where it operates, signed the statement, which was circulated by e-mail on Sunday and published in its entirety on a blog dedicated to covering the drug wars.  Mexican authorities were not immediately available to comment on the authenticity of the communication.  The cartel accuses the federal police of committing abuses in the region and blaming them. The authorities have attacked the cartel and any person caught in its path, be it civilians, women or children, the cartel alleges. It also wishes the residents of Michoacan a happy new year.  The Familia Michoacana "separates itself from any criminal act that occurred in the month of December 2010 that the federal authorities want to make us responsible for," the statement says.  A similar letter circulated last month offered a truce for the month of December, though that didn't mean the the month was without violence. The Mexican government continued its operations against the cartel, killing one of its leaders, Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, after two days of armed confrontations.  Five federal police officers and three civilians, including two minors, were killed in the operation, a national security spokesman said at the time. Three members of La Familia Michoacana were killed and three others captured. Authorities described a scene of heavy gunfire where cartel members set trucks and buses on fire on highways to block police from arriving.  Another cartel leader, Francisco Lopez Villanueva, alias "El Bigote," was captured at the end of the month.  The truce will be extended another month "to continue demonstrating to the authorities, federal government and above all the Michoacan residents that the Familia Michoacana is not guilty of all of the criminal acts that the authorities and federal government make public through the media," the statement says.

A nice glass of wine, a puff on a cigar and a few clubs.  It sounds like a decent night outexcept these clubs are golf clubs.  When Miguel Angel Jimenez became the oldest ever winner on the European Tour following his triumph at the Hong Kong Open in November, he celebrated in the only way he knew howwith a big, fat cigar.  At 49, Jimenez, who replaced Des Smyth as the oldest winner on the European Tour at the age of 48 and 318 days, is man with a hinterland which stretches well beyond sport.  While the rest of the world rushes around at breakneck speed, Jimenez often sits, looks out onto the Mediterranean and contemplates the meaning of lifea subject he's had a lot of time to think about since breaking his leg in a ski accident last December.  "You have to do whatever you want in your life when you are alive," Jimenez told CNN's Living Golf on location in his hometown of Malaga.  "I love to ski, I love to drink, I love to smoke, I love to compete and I love to have time with my friends.  "I don't want to stop any of those things. I'm sorry, but I'm honest.  "Freedom is so nice, to do what you're doing in your life, to do what you want in your lifethat's genuine. It doesn't matter what."  If sport these days is characterized by a winner takes all mentality summed up by legendary NFL coach Vince Lombardi's famous remark"Show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser"then Jimenez's approach is the very antithesis to that philosophy.  "I do what I like in my life and I'm not going to change that. If a major is coming then it will be 'wow', but if the major is not coming, I'm still going to do what I like with my life."  A wry smile appears on his face as he waves his hand towards the camera and adds: "Bye, bye major."  But don't let Jimenez's "pleasure pursuit principle" disguise the ambition which still burns fiercely within his heartthe passion and determination to compete with the latest generation of stars remains as strong as ever.  "I spend many days a week working at the gym and if I don't at the age of 49 then I've no chance of competing with the younger ones," he said.  "Of course, I really enjoy having my glass of wine, having nice food and just to have a cigar with nice company and I enjoy my life.  "You know somebody told me a long time ago that this life we're going to spend more time dead than alive. So, when you're alive, live."  However, as he wrings every last ounce of pleasure out of life you won't find Jimenez telling the world about it on social media networks.  While Tiger Woods tweets to over 3.2 million followers and Rory McIlroy converses with his 1.2 million fans, the Spaniard prefers the old-fashioned method of talking to people.  "But sometimes people forget that you need to enjoy it, we need to enjoy friends, we need to enjoy family and we need to enjoy the things which happen around ourselves," said the Spaniard.  "People identify with a lot of modern things such as computers and social networking. I feel that people have lost communication between people.  "Now there is a lot of communication by information, but I prefer to touch the people, to talk to the people."  Jimenez made his professional debut 30 years ago. During that time the clubs have got bigger and heavieras have the pay checks and the relentless media attention which comes with life on the Tour.  "Golf has always been professional, but now it's getting more so," he added.  "People are more into that and are more like horses when they wear blinkersthey don't see sideways.  "You have to be yourself and if you're like that then it's fine, you have to respect those things, no?"  Jimenez makes no judgments on how others choose lead their lives, but he is insistence that his laid back and carefree attitude remains at the center of his equilibrium.  "The most important thing is, and I've always said the same thing, you have to enjoy what you do in your life," he said.  "I do a little bit of this, a little bit of that and my life is going forward.  "That is what I recommend to people. Enjoy yourself, enjoy your life and do whatever you want to do in life.  "But don't come to play golf if you want to do something else and don't do something else if you want to do golf.  "You have to make a compromise with yourself about what you want to do."  The affable Jimenez makes his comeback at Thursday's Spanish Open at the Parador de El Saler course in Valencia, providing the Spaniard with an opportunity to test out a body which has been put through months of rehabilitation.  "It's made me more determined," he said.  "I love the game and these three months of not competing, I'm missing some important venues.  "I love to compete. It's the only thing I know how to do properly in my life.  "It doesn't matter whether you win or not, but you're doing what you like in your life and I stopped doing things.  "I've stopped competing with the young guys. I've stopped competing in the tournaments. I miss all these things and that's what I want to do."  Jimenez's 19 tour wins remain a source of great pride of satisfaction as does his success with the European Ryder Cup teammost recently as assistant captain at Medinah.  While the next few days should give an indication of how his body is holding up, Jimenez is undecided as to how long he will continue playing at the very highest level.  "I've seen four kinds of generations and I've played with them. To me I think it's a privilege to be part of the history with them.  "I haven't won a major, but I don't regret anything. I feel satisfied to be part of all this, I feel so happy with that.  "I'm on the way back, I don't know for how long. To me I will keep competitive or in competition with the young people for as long as I can play well and win a tournament.  "But if I don't play well and just finish winning it's time to go."  
 The Tanzanian island of Zanzibar began three official days of mourning Sunday, a day after 200 people died when a ferry jammed with passengers and tons of cargo capsized amid strong waves.  In addition to Tanzania, South Africa was sending divers and navy forces to help with recovery efforts, said Mohamed Aboud, the state minister of Zanzibar.  British officials have also sent helicopters to help with the search efforts.  "Right now, we are focusing on getting the bodies for the relatives, but you never know, God is God ... we might find people alive," he said.  Rescuers saved 579 people, including 20 children, Aboud said.  "A lot of children are going back to Zanzibar for school, so there were a lot on the ferry," said Ismail Katumba, a resident of Dar es Salaam. "It was so chaotic. It was so crowded."  The minister said the ferry carries a maximum capacity of about 600 people and was traveling between the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba.  But additional passengers, who were apparently not registered, had also made their way onboard, he said.  It capsized in predawn hours local time, sending passengers scrambling for any available objects to avoid getting swallowed by the dark waves, witnesses said.  Some jumped atop mattresses floating from the cargo.  Fisherman, local hotels and residents joined rescue crews to help in the search, authorities said.  Rescue crews took bodies to a nearby tent.  "You could hear people screaming loud and crying as bodies surfaced, mostly children," said Katumba, who lost a friend in the accident. "What you do is you just go over and start looking at the bodies to identify them."  Most of the rescued were transported to local hospitals for treatment, and some have been discharged.  President Ali Mohamed Shein of Zanzibar, who ordered the three days of mourning, also called for flags to fly at half staff.  Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete also said the nation would mark three days of mourning starting Sunday.  The government has buried dozens of unidentified victims, the minister said, and will maintain records for those searching for loved ones.  Pemba and Zanzibar, the two main islands on the Zanzibar archipelago, are popular among tourists for their pristine sandy beaches on the Indian Ocean.  Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania.  CNN's Jim Clancy, Nicole Saidi, Samira Said and journalist Richard Mgamba contributed to this report

Legend has it that when Napoleon's second-in-command asked his boss if he preferred a courageous general or a brilliant general he replied: "What I want is a lucky general."  Napoleon knew what others have notedon a rapidly changing battlefield, there are the things you know you know, the things you know you don't know, and the things you don't know you don't know. It's in this last category that fortunes are so often made or broken.  And so it is in our careers. The big events that matter most are often those that we can least predict. You take a course in college that inspires you to change your major. You get a new job after a friend of a friend refers you to a company you'd never heard of before. You propose a process innovation that occurs to you in the shower while thinking about building a tree house for your daughter.  Serendipity is the ability to take a chance occurrencea surprising idea, person or eventand make creative use of it. Yet serendipity can be exceedingly difficult to pull off in the midst of our busy work lives.  Why? Because we are psychologically wired to find the things that match our expectations and discount what doesn't. For most of us, our education and work environments only reinforce this behavior. We are tunnel-visioned. Yet the benefits of having a robust peripheral vision are overwhelming. Besides being responsible for so much of our innovation, peripheral vision is how we discover new opportunities and adapt to a rapidly changing world.  Find the people that matter  In business we are often at the mercy of chance to locate the people that we should be working with. There was no matchmaking service that brought together Lennon and McCartney, Jobs and Wozniak, or Ben and Jerry. Each of these people put themselves in motionthey escaped their isolated environments or routines long enough to bump into others. Circumstance brought these personalities together, but to achieve success they had to connect, see something in each other and ultimately take the initiative in pursuing the partnership.  How many collaborators, new hires and customer prospects do we miss because we aren't looking for them when they appear in our lives? If the answer is "more than a few," it's a good time to develop your skill of motion.  Get out of the cubicle, and work for a few hours in the lobby, cafe or cafeteria where visitors are coming in and out all day. You might also attend local meetups or conferences, but rather than targeting other people based on where they work or their job title, avoid looking at nametags altogether. The people who seem least likely to be able to help you (e.g. that crazy guy in the tie-dye t-shirt) might just be the most helpful of all.  See also: Is workplace boredom 'the new stress?'  Use surprise events  When 29-year old Howard Schultz was sent to Milan on a business trip his bosses gave him a very focused goalbuy wholesale beans for the coffee-bean shop he worked for. Yet he found something that deeply surprised him. On every corner of the city there were espresso bars that both served amazing coffee drinks and acted as social meeting places.  He had never seen anything like it before, and he suddenly knew in his bones that this concept could be huge in America. He pitched his bosses on the idea, but they rejected him out of hand. They had no interest in becoming a "restaurant" business. Instead he pursued the idea on his own, ultimately creating the global phenomenon known as Starbucks.  Schultz was able to see beyond the task he'd been assigned and imagined a future where the coffee-bar phenomenon had transformed the entire industry. Like Schultz, we must foster our peripheral vision to rise above our to-do lists and be ready when a surprise event occurs. Dedicating time to non work-related interests helps us distance ourselves from our primary tasks. This distance allows us to make the connections across domains that lead to insights and innovations.  See also: To realize your potential, 'dare to be different'  Solve problems based on unexpected sources  In 1979 Sir James Dyson was obsessed with the idea of building a better vacuum cleaner, but it wasn't until he stumbled on an industrial cyclone at the local sawmill that he came up with an idea for how to solve the technical problem.  Having an overriding purpose affects how we see the world. Dyson was committed to improving on the vacuum design, and this gave him eyes to see the solution embedded in the cyclone machine. Another engineer without this obsession never would have connected the cyclone to a consumer vacuum. By developing a strong perspective we increase the likelihood we'll run into the very things that will be most helpful to us, wherever they emerge from.  Put simply, we can learn to harness serendipity as a rigorous business practice. The most successful entrepreneurs and business generally do, allowing chance to intervene in their routinized work lives, recognizing the most promising opportunities, and taking action on them, even if they challenge their best laid plans. Or, perhaps, precisely because they challenge them.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thor Muller.  
 (Mental Floss)When it comes to the following tourist destinations, the trick will be getting there before the wrecking ball does.  Limestone pinnacles do not make Nauru a pinnacle of success in the tourism business.  1. Nauru  This tiny island in the South Pacific may soon be completely uninhabitable, and it's all because the locals forgot to follow the Boy Scout motto: Be prepared.  Since the turn of the 20th century, Nauru has been one of the world's prime sources for phosphate, a mineral compound formed over time from bird excrement, and an important ingredient in fertilizer.  Phosphate mining quickly made Nauru rich, and at one point, the island even boasted the world's second-highest per capita GDP. But, as it turns out, basing your entire economy on dung can have its drawbacks.  For one thing, phosphate is a limited resource. By 2000, many believed the island's supply had dried up. In fact, all mining ceased until the government managed to hunt down the last few traces of the mineral in 2006.  But the phosphate will soon be gone, leaving Nauru without a profitable export and without decent, farmable land. That's because phosphate runs in veins throughout the limestone and coral foundation of the island. To collect it, miners have to rip up the ground, leaving pillars and pits of less-valuable land behind.  About four-fifths of the island is now ravaged to the point that no crops can grow and no one can inhabit it. Worse, the ruined landscape collects heat, which ends up creating a pattern of warm air that prevents rain clouds from forming.  Currently, Nauru imports almost all its food and water, and there don't seem to be any industries poised to replace mining once the phosphate is gone.  2. The Dead Sea  The Dead Sea is famous for being the lowest point on Earth (an ear-popping 1,400 feet below sea level) and for being so salty that humans naturally float on top of it.  But in recent years, it's also become famous for the tremendous rate at which it's evaporating. Currently, the Sea recedes about 3 feet each year, leaving ever-growing plains of salty, puckered, sinkhole-prone dirt in its wake.  To really understand the phenomenon, tourists need only visit the Ein Gedi Spa. When it opened 20 years ago, you could step out the back door and be within a few feet of the salty water. But today, the Sea has receded so much that the trek to its shore amounts to a 1-mile hike.  The Dead Sea's imminent demise is also due to its neighbors' need for water. For the past several decades, Israelis, Palestinians, and Jordanians have been siphoning off more and more of the River Jordanthe Dead Sea's primary water source. Growing populations and increased agriculture now require so much hydration that the Jordan is barely a trickle of its former self.  Several solutions have been suggested, but the most promising is a canal that would funnel water from the Red Sea to the Middle East. The only problem is that the plan relies on Israel, Palestine, and Jordan engaging in long-term friendly relationssomething that may not happen in time to save the treasured landmark.  3. Mexico City  We've all felt that "sinking" feeling in the pit of our stomachs before, but imagine having it under the soles of your shoesall the time. That's part of life in Mexico City, which is built on the site of a former lake.  In fact, the city was originally built on the lake, via a series of Aztec-designed aquatic platforms. Nifty as that was, the Spanish conquerors who tore through the land in the 16th century preferred a more traditional approach to urbanization, so they drained the lake and built a European-style city in the empty basin. Almost immediately, this proved to be a poor idea. Foundations sank into the soft clay and left many buildings tilting at odd angles.  That alone might have made Mexico City just a little eccentriccharming, even. But as its population ballooned during the 20th century, the government had to search for new sources of water. Officials ended up pumping much of the city's supply out of the underground aquifer that had once fed the lake, which amounted to yet another bad idea.  As the aquifer emptied, the soft clay above sank faster and deeper. In the past century, Mexico City has sunk more than 30 feet. Even worse, there's no clear, practical plan today for how to stop the droop and still provide water for the area's 22 million people.  We suggest you run for the border with a camera and click some pics while you still can.  4. Amish Country  Don't get us wrong; in 20 years, there will still be Amish people, and there will still be places known as "Amish Country." But, chances are, both will be very different from their traditional versions.  The Amish, who originally emigrated from Europe in the 18th century, are most closely associated with farming and a technology-free lifestyle. And while the community has valued its isolation since the 1970s, those cultural norms have been shifting.  The key culprit? The ever-skyrocketing price of land. Amish families typically have an average of seven children, which translates to a fast-growing populationa population that's running out of room to expand. Because rural regions have become more popular with average Americans, many places that were farmland 20 years ago are now subdivisions, factories, and office complexes (not to mention a fair share of Amish Country tourist condos). Basically, the Amish need more land, but that land is now scarcer and more expensive.  So what's a separatist religious community to do? In many cases, the answer has been "become less separatist." Today, a majority of Amish don't rely on farming as their sole source of income. Many have side businesses, often connected with the tourism industry, and some Amish have even taken jobs in non-Amish owned factories, making the old life increasingly difficult to maintain.  5. Freetown Christiania  The area now known as Freetown Christiania was originally a military base meant to defend one of the main waterways into the Danish capital of Copenhagen. But in 1971, it was captured by an invasion force nobody in the Danish military expectedhippies.  At the time, the base wasn't being used, so it was pretty easy for a gaggle of unarmed characters to take over. Beyond simply staging a short-term sit-in, the group hunkered down for the long haul and declared the abandoned base its own autonomous country.  With little resistance from Denmark's tolerant government, the residents of Christiania spent the next several years building a society where all property is collectively owned, all decisions are made by painstaking group consensus, and all marijuana is openly grown and sold.  Through the years, the hippies became entrepreneurs as wellfounding businesses, opening cafes and music venues, and even inventing and marketing a transport bicycle perfect for moving large loads through Christiania's car-free streets.  Despite its status as one of Copenhagen's top tourist attractions, Christiania's days may be numbered. Since 2004, the newly elected conservative government has been cracking down on the hippie enclavefirst by staging a major drug bust and, more recently, by instituting a redevelopment plan for the land (which is still, technically, federal property).  One major change tentatively approved by Christiania residents in April 2007 would turn the Citizen's Council into a regular public housing association and greatly increase rents. According to the Copenhagen Post, adult Christianians previously paid about $45 a month into a common fund to live there. Now, they'll have to pay the government closer to $800 a month. In addition, the plan gives the government the authority to tear down some hippie-built homes and replace them with (gasp!) condos.

	 "Thor Muller: We're all in the middle of a crisis. But we can"
Engines rev up Sunday for the start of the 2013 NASCAR season with the 55th running of the Daytona 500, stock car racing's biggest event. But for one driver, the race is about more than a possible trip to victory lane. Michael Waltrip is racing for Sandy Hook.  The events of December 14 left most of America stunned and clutching their children a little tighter. The loss of 20 children and six employees at the Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school united people in grief across the globe, many of whom had an immediate desire to help.  NASCAR President Mike Helton was among those. He knew that his stock car racing family had to act. Two-time Daytona winner Waltrip said Helton called him up and said, "I've got something I think we should do for the Daytona 500."  Helton, Waltrip and Swan Racingthe team Waltrip will drive for in Sunday's racehad a private meeting with Newtown officials, community leaders, first responders and victims' families in early February. At a February 14 event in Daytona Beach, Florida, it was announced that Waltrip's car number 30 would be changed to 26 and his colors would be green and white to honor those lost.  There will also be a message on the car, "Text Newtown to 80888," for fans to make a $10 donation to the Sandy Hook School Support Fund, which was established by the United Way of Western Connecticut and Newtown Savings Bank. NASCAR says 100% of the funds raised will go directly to help meet the needs of the Newtown community.  Those needs are two-fold, according to Waltrip. First, he said he hopes having a personal connection to the race will give the townspeople a boost, even if momentarily. A city official "told me that after that meeting she'd seen smiles on some people's faces that she hadn't seen since the devastating events of December 14. So on Sunday for a little bit of time at least, I think the town can escape reality and enjoy one of the greatest sporting events in the world with something to root for," Waltrip said.  "And secondly who knows what kind of therapy and recovery the children and schoolteachers and the people of the town will need going forward. So it's going to be a lot of money for counseling and helping people through that day and who knows what all the money could be used fora memorial, a new school. ... We just want to make sure that there's always money there to help people in need."  Waltrip also owns a racing team, Michael Waltrip Racing, and all three of his drivers entered in Sunday's raceClint Bowyer in No. 15, Mark Martin in No. 55 and Martin Truex Jr. in No. 56will have decals on their cars to support the cause. "We're ready to go racing, ready to put some smiles on faces and raise money," Waltrip said, who also is tweeting information about the campaign drive.  Donations have already started coming in, Waltrip said. NASCAR Chairman and CEO Brian France and his wife, Amy, pledged a personal donation of $50,000, and the NASCAR Foundation has matched that donation, according to Waltrip.  "Looking out at a room of smiling faces amidst the aftermath of a horrible tragedy was very powerful," France said. "It hit me that the NASCAR industry and our passionate fan base have an unbelievable opportunity to rally around this cause and make a huge difference."  Waltrip is counting on fans when he climbs into his car Sunday afternoon, and he said he has faith his extended family will come through for the people of Newtown.  "I think you see it all the time and that's the reason why we do it because they (fans) respond, they support. They want to help worthy causes as well so we rely on that 75 million people in our fan base to step up when we have a great cause. And that's what makes it so special that the fans really appreciate what we do and they really want to be a part of it."  He added, "Driving the No. 26 Sandy Hook School Support Fund Toyota is like nothing I have ever been part of in my NASCAR career. It will be an emotional week knowing that we have the potential to do so much good for the Newtown community. I'm racing for a reason."

 Intended or not, the central image on the Facebook page of Jacob "Jake" Roberts, the Oregon shopping mall gunman, is haunting.  A "Follow Your Dreams" slogan painted on a wall is stamped "Cancelled" in reda work by famed street artist Banksy.  Describing himself, Roberts made an attempt at humor.  "Hey what's up guys my names Jake and I'm an alcoholic... Lol just kidding," Roberts wrote in the first line of his introduction, which included grammatical errors. "If you were to ask someone that knows me they would probably say that I am a pretty funny person that takes sarcasm to the max.  Read more: Oregon mall shooting victims remembered  "I'm the conductor of my choo choo train," he continued. "I may be young but I have lived one crazy life so far."  Authorities have released a photograph of Roberts, 22, who wore a hockey-like face mask as he shot at holiday shoppers Tuesday at the Clackamas Town Center in Happy Valley, Oregon, near Portland. He killed two people and then himself.  The photograph of Jacob Tyler Roberts depicts a thin chin beard and gauge earrings embedded in both lobes. Black, wavy hair frames a half-smile.  One of his Facebook friends, Brittany Curry, 21, told CNN she dated Roberts for five months last year. They met through mutual friends in the Portland area, she said.  "I am in shock. I don't know what to feel," Curry said in a telephone interview. "He was really a good guy. He was really happy. He put everybody before himself."  Roberts owned one gun, Curry said, but she didn't want to elaborate.  His Facebook page lists "shooting" as one of his 10 interests, along with camping, sleeping, rafting, BMX, sushi and spending money.  Read more: Details, but no answers, in Oregon mall shooting  Roberts told Curry that his mother died at childbirth and he never met his father, she said. He left his maternal aunt's home at age 14, Curry said.  "He raised himself," Curry said. "He was doing it all on his own."  A friend from high school, Jordan Salazar, said she understood that Roberts' parents were not present in his life. He was a skateboarder back then, she said.  "In high school Jake was a nice guy, outgoing," Salazar told CNN.  "I saw him a few times in the last year. He seemed normal" and a "good guy," she added.  Roberts valued his friends, Curry said.  Roberts wrote on his Facebook page: "My friends are my family and I don't think that will ever change. I have done a lot for myself in the past year some good and some bad but I still press on.  "I like hanging out with my friends and having a good time maybe get a little drunk every now and then. I like to think of myself as a bit of an adrenaline junkie... Yup that's right I'm a junkie lol. But I'm just looking to meet new people and see the world," Roberts typed.  When they were dating, Roberts was living in an apartment across from the Clackamas Town Center mall, Curry said.  Roberts wanted to be a firefighter and was taking classes at Clackamas Community College, Curry said.  "It was always his dream," Curry said.  In the meantime, he had been working as a cook at Big Bertha's gyro eatery in Portland for more than two years, Curry said.  About that job, Roberts commented on Facebook: "Right now I work at the most badass gyro shop in town. I am one of the few people that can say I love my job and actually mean it."

	 'Michael Waltrip is racing for Sandy Hook. The events of December 14 left most of America stunned'
Washington When Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, pronounced this week that "17 angry old white men will wake up and realize they've just bought the country," after the elections, he echoed the distaste many Americans feel at the secrecy surrounding the flood of money pouring into campaigns.  Political experts estimate $6 billion will be spent during the 2012 presidential elections  a large chunk of it via anonymous donors thanks to a Supreme Court ruling which allows unlimited corporate campaign donations. That's enough money to give 6/7ths of the world's population $1 each. Politicos and even comedians have made much ado about the influence of anonymous super rich donors and well heeled super PACs, groups that can raise money from a number of sources and spend unlimited amounts independent of and in support of political campaigns.  Democrats on Capitol Hill bemoaned failed efforts this week at forcing out of the shadows political campaign donors who give more than $10,000 to independent groups. Republicans called Democratic efforts a disingenuous attempt to silence critics by going "after the microphone instead, by trying to scare off the funders," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, long an advocate of campaign donations as a form of free speech.  Senate Republicans block DISCLOSE Act for second straight day  "We are determined to prove that transparency is not a radical concept," Sen. Tom Udall, D-New Mexico, said of the bill to force groups to reveal big donors' identities. "Our bill is as simple and straightforward as it getsif you are making large donations to influence an election, the voters in that election should know who you are. The American people are blessed with common sense. They know that when someone will not admit to something, it is usually because there is something to hide."  It's an issue that's chock-ful of sermonizing and spin.  "Every election we have a lot of hand-wringing... but this issue has been with us a long time," said Michael Toner, a former Federal Election Commission chairman and a veteran campaign finance attorney.  The fact is the Supreme Court has found that this practice qualifies as free speech.  The fact is lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have puntedrepeatedlyon forcing big donors to disclose their identities. Lawmakers such as McConnell once supported transparency for these types of donations but later vociferously advocated anonymity to protect donors from harassment.  The fact is both major political parties and conservative and liberal groups alike have benefited for decades from money donated from the shadows.  "Yes, there are some pretty rich people who support super PACs because they have some strong ideas. The super PACS are not the evil so many people portray them to be," said Joel Gora, a Brooklyn Law School professor who worked on Buckley v. Valeo, the landmark 1970s Supreme Court case that determined spending money to influence elections is a form of free speech.  Pro-Obama super PAC raises $6.1 million in June  "Just because some people can speak more than other people, the solution is not to prevent them to speaking," Gora said. "It's to help...level up free speech for everybody."  Still, something about it, for many folks, just feels, well, wrong.  A poll conducted in April of roughly 1,000 likely voters by the the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that "one in four Americans  26%  say they are less likely to vote because big donors to super PACs have so much more influence over elected officials than average Americans."  Pro-Romney super PAC brings in $20 million in June  For some voters, big dollars means big trouble for the electoral process.  "Of course that kind of money spells trouble! If nothing else, it leaves the suspicion that the office is for sale to the highest bidder," Phil Clouser said on CNN Politics' Facebook page. "Campaign spending should be limited to whatever the office will pay for that term."  Others feel the bluster over anonymous donors is a red herring.  President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney "will each spend a lot on advertising as is usually done. This election is much more important to conservatives so they are making a lot of contributions to Romney," Judi Purcell said on CNN Politics' Facebook page. "Obama has gone to a lot of fundraisers so he has a lot of money too. That's the way is it and those who don't like it don't have to like it."  Why Democrats need labor unions  
 A California transit authority has agreed to pay damages to five men who were detained with Oscar Grant, the victim of a high-profile fatal police shooting in 2009.  The Bay Area Rapid Transport (BART) settled a federal civil rights lawsuit out of court for a sum of $175,000, spokeswoman Alicia Trost told CNN.  "This settlement closes the case for a considerably smaller amount compared to what would have been a long and costly trial if allowed to move forward," she said.  Grant's killing sparked public furor, when cell phone video went viral showing former transit police officer Johannes Mehserle shooting him in the back, while another officer knelt over him.  Grant was unarmed.  His death became the subject of the award winning movie "Fruitvale Station," named after the BART station, where he was shot.  Mehserle testified at his 2010 trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun. He was sentenced to two years in prison after his involuntary manslaughter conviction but was released after serving 11 months.  Activists felt the former law officer deserved the tougher conviction of second degree murder, and violent protests erupted after Mehserle's sentence was handed down. At least 150 people were arrested by the police, after crowds threw rocks and bottles and tore down fences.  BART has implemented dozens of recommendations made by the Nation Organization of Black Law Enforcement (NOBLE) since Grant's killing, Trost said.

Lance Armstrong's fall from grace has left one of the cyclist's former sponsors not only "sad"but also without one of its biggest marketing tools.  Premier sports eyewear firm Oakley was one of several companiesincluding Nike, Trek and Anheuser-Buschto end lucrative deals with the American when he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after refusing to answer charges of systematic drug use.  Oakley said the 41-year-old had been a "symbol of possibility" when he signed up, having inspired millions when he returned to competition after recovering from testicular cancer and then won cycling's blue riband event from 1999-2005.  He also raised hundreds of millions of dollars for charity through his Livestrong foundation before a report by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency this year left his legacy in tatters.  British Armstrong effigy causes outrage  "The Lance story is a sad one, with our emotional connection with that athlete," Oakley chief executive Colin Baden told CNN.  "We have been very consistent in how we view cheating and we've always stuck with this over the 16 years I've been with the brand, so that if the governing body rules that an athlete has broken the rules, we can't be a sponsor.  "I don't think we'll change any of our strategic views of who we want to promote the brand, but how that person behaves is critical to having a positive relationship."  Many people who once backed Armstrong, following years of allegations about his potentially being a drug user, have now expressed their anger at his apparent duplicity but Baden said there was no point in recriminations.  "For me personally, it's an emotional response. I've never found anger to lead to anything constructive in lifeit's just a disappointment," Baden said.  "I can be angry, but it won't change the situation, so I'm just left with the grief of what was a great story."  Baden said there had been no question of Oakley dropping Armstrong until he was officially stripped of his titles.  "We've had athletes fall in the category before and still followed the same rule. Once the recognized governing body rules against them, we follow that governing body's recommendations," he said.  "I feel like we're not responding to emotion, we're not responding to the story of the daywe're following the law."  Cycling's governing body has told Armstrong to return a reported $5 million in prize money he won at the Tour, though it will not reallocate his victories.  Texas company SCA Promotions is also seeking the return of $12 million it paid Armstrong, but Baden said Oakley would not be following suit.  The company, which has been endorsed by the likes of basketball legend Michael Jordan, tennis star Andre Agassi and now golf's rising star Rory McIlroy, will have to plug the gap left by the fall of one of its most marketable names.  "I like to think of us as a premier sports performance company and we do really extreme product developmentand sometimes the products we develop are unique and it requires somebody in what we call 'the front row' to explain to the masses that this is the best," Baden said.  "So any athlete that we're targeting to have a relationship with has to be perceived as the best. There's a reason he's choosing our productsit's not because we pay him to do it, it's because it pays to do it."  
 Basel Imagine a world where computing becomes invisible, like your thoughts. A world where the interface between our senses, our minds and brains, and a digital device that emulates human traits or which augments our own capabilities becomes seamless, and the border between "it" and "us" becomes opaque.  Imagine instant access to the world's data and content, without typing or without even searchingthink GoogleNow x100, projected onto your iris. The power of IBM's Watson at the disposal of every doctor, with a blink of an eye or a simple voice command. Anticipatory services that know what you need before you do. Constant reads of my body's status via my wristwatch.  Convenient. Incredible. Empowering. Beautiful. Addictive. Indispensable. Scary. Here soon.  Vast progress and vast curses  "Nothing vast enters the lives of mortals without a curse" Greek tragedian Sophocles once said. And plenty of curses are sure to emerge when it's about wearables, which are powered by big data, the cloud, artificial intelligence, not to forget good old-fashioned capitalism.  It is the danger of exponential unintended consequences we must start to consider, because we probably don't have the choice to "just say no"wearable computing is as certain as mobile phones.  In his 1964 book "Understanding Media," Marshall McLuhan famously called media "the extensions of man." If we can define wearables as "media" then, following mobile devices, wearables are the next logical step in this rapid evolution.  Beyond this, wearables are very likely to be followed by some kind of direct connectivity of our brains and neural systems with computers (think brain computer interfaces) and implants. You get the picture.  We can see so much moreand we are seen even more  One of the key challenges with wearables may be similar to what we are already facing in digital media and entertainment.  Powerful, smart, internet-connected TVs are ushering in an era when we can see pretty much anything we want on enormous super-HD screens, be it TV programs, movies and videos, photos, Skype conversations, tweets, games or telepresence events.  But few of us realize that in return our "TVs" (think: visual super-computers) can now also "sense," see and hear us using their built-in video cameras, microphones, data-sucking software and face-recognition apps.  Indeed, these TVs will truly know who we are and what we doand naturally, therein lies their tremendous value to those that can reach us through them. This is about data not just about contentwe are the ones being watched while we are watching content at ever lower cost.  Similar (yet much more wicked) issues are certain to arise with the boom in wearable devices. On the one hand, yes, we can be infinitely better and faster in gauging and understanding ourselves and the world around us using smart watches, fitness bands or smart meters.  A nicely designed smart-watch that reminds me of my next appointment, alerts me of urgent developments in my stock portfolio, tells me that I should start exercising more or even predicts how likely me and my date are to hit it off... all of this may seem quite useful, at least to some of us.  At the same time, the flip side of this amazing newand seemingly freeconvenience is that my smart devices, virtual agents and active AI apps will also get to know me better than any human ever could as far as my raw data is concerned.  And these will be technologies that are also self-learning. Data flows in both directions, and increasingly a Faustian bargain is struck than would scare the wits out of George Orwell: trade your privacy for convenience; jump into that amazing data and information worm-hole; achieve super-powers!  Watch the first episode of The Future Show with Gerd Leonhard on 'Privacy Failure' here  Google Glass and the nude beach problem  To me, wearable computing devices such as Google Glass are facing what I call "the nude beach problem." If everyone around me is using Google Glass I may feel like an odd-ball by not "being naked" as well.  Conversely, if I am the only that's nude (i.e. wearing Google Glass) and everyone else is fully dressed, I would probably not be very welcome. This may help to explain the chilly reception that Google Glass users have received.  We urgently need some new social contracts herebut unfortunately Google has rarely paid much attention to those thorny side-effects of their amazing inventions.  This is why I believe the key opportunities for most wearable computing devices is in business or professional situations where it doesn't really matter if only a few people use it, such as with doctors, firefighters or the check-in staff at the airline counter.  In all these cases the clear purpose of technology is to better serve us, rather than for us to better serve the technology and those that dish it up.  This will emerge as a key distinction because making humans as readable as USB drives, exploiting massive privacy failurewhether by design or by unintended consequenceor proposing the complete eradication of anonymity cannot possibly be in the interest of any business or government except for those that seek totalitarian dominance.  This is why those that work on wearables need to ask that all-important question: will these devices and services add real, lasting, human value to their users, or will they just be fancy digital mouse traps, addiction-generators or extensions-of-man that seek to eventually "be man"?

The Czech Republic's practice of surgically castrating convicted sex offenders is "invasive, irreversible and mutilating" and should stop immediately, the Council of Europe's Anti-Torture Committee said in a report made public Thursday.  The central European country castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to April 2008, when investigators from the Council of Europe, a human-rights forum, visited the Czech Republic.  The Council of Europe condemned the practice as "degrading."  The procedure is being performed even on first-time, non-violent offenders, such as exhibitionists, its investigation revealed.  Prisoners have to request castration under Czech law, but many fear they will be jailed for life if they do not, the investigation found.  "In practically all the cases, these patients indicated that their application was at least partially instigated by fear of long-term detention," the report said.  "Some patients claimed that the treating sexologist had explicitly told them that surgical castration was the only available option to them and that refusal would mean lifelong detention."  And it warned that some "significantly" mentally retarded people had been castrated.  "In at least five cases, legally incapacitated offenders were surgically castrated," the report said. "In all of these instances, the court-appointed guardian had signed the consent form; in two cases, the guardians were mayors."  The investigators found only two convicts who had spontaneously volunteered for castration, while others they interviewed said mental health staff specializing in sexuality had recommended it.  "The other patients interviewed indicated that the treating sexologist had suggested surgical castration, in several cases within a week of the patient's admission to hospital," the report said.  "Some of the sexologists interviewed by the delegation themselves affirmed that for certain patients there was no alternative treatment to surgical castration."  The Czech Republic defends the practice as voluntary, saying castration aims permanently to reduce testosterone levels in order to diminish the offender's sexual urges.  The process, officially called "therapeutic testicular pulpectomies ... are performed upon a written request of an adult man," the Czech government responded. It said the operation had to be approved by a committee of experts.  "Prior to the performance of such intervention, the patient must express his consent with its performance. Castration is considered with respect to men who cannot manage their sexual instincts and are sexually aggressive," the Czech government said, saying the Council of Europe had not proven its case sufficiently for the country to abandon castration.  It argues the procedure is effective in reducing repeat offenses.  But the Council of Europe questioned the statistics on repeat offenses and said even if they were correct, castration was not an appropriate way to reduce recidivism.  "The committee's delegation came across three cases in which sex offenders had committed serious sex-related crimes, including serial rape and attempted murder, after they had been surgically castrated," the human-rights group said.  "Surgical castration is no longer a generally accepted medical intervention in the treatment of sex-offenders," the report said.  It said candidates for castration often received information about the procedure which was too technical to understandor no information at all.  "Several patients who had undergone surgical castration told the delegation that they would never have applied for surgical castration had they been properly informed," the report warned.  It condemned the practice as "an irreversible intervention that always leads to infertility and, in the long run, a significantly increased risk of osteoporosis," also warning of possible depression and changes in appearance.  It said it was impossible to determine how many people had been castrated in keeping with a 1966 law.  The Council of Europe delegation visited the Czech Republic from March 25 to April 2, 2008. It issued its report and the Czech response on July 23, 2008. It made them public on Thursday at the request of the Czech government, it said.  
 Los Angeles Justin Bieber dragged his date on stage with him to accept the American Music Awards artist of the year honor Sunday night.  It was his mom.  "I want to thank you for just always believing in me," the 18-year-old singer said, looking into the eyes of his mother, Pattie Mallette.  Bieber was the biggest winner at the 40th annual American Music Awards, winning artist of the year, favorite pop/rock artist and favorite pop/rock album.  Carly Rae Jepsen, who won new artist of the year, introduced Bieber as the "current generation's biggest superstar."  Bieber used one of his acceptance speeches to address "all the haters who thought that, you know, that maybe I was just here for one or two years."  "I feel like I'm going to be here for a very long time," he said.  Missing from the three-hour show in Los Angeles' Nokia Theater was its originator Dick Clark, who was remembered in a musical tribute performed by Stevie Wonder. Clark, known as "America's oldest teenager" died April 18 at the age of 82.  "This show, on its 40th anniversary, still reflects Dick's original vision," host Ryan Seacrest, a Clark protg, told the audience.  "Bring the top artists on the planet together on an equal stage and then let the music speak for itself."  It was, perhaps, that inspiration that produced one of the show's most energetic moments: South Korean rapper Psy's collaboration with MC Hammer in a dance medley to a mash-up of Psy's online viral hit "Gangnam Style" and Hammer's 1991 sensation "Too Legit to Quit."  "That was so awesome," Psy told CNN backstage after the show. "We experienced miracle tonight."  Hammer, who triggered a dance craze in the early 1990s, said he and Psy are "kindred spirits" and they may work together again. "He's got the whole world dancing," he said, comparing Psy to James Brown, Michael Jackson and himself.  Nicki Minaj, who performed twice, walked away with two honors, including favorite rap/hip hop artist and favorite rap/hip hop album.  "Man, I been did dat," Minaj said as she accepted the artist award, referencing her win in the same category last year. "Man, I been popped out."  Carrie Underwood's "Blown Away" was chosen favorite country album. All four albums Underwood has released have won the honor.  "I couldn't love my life anymore than I do right now," she said.  Luke Bryan, who won favorite country male artist, used his first AMA acceptance speech to thank his sons "Tater Bug and Bobo."  Taylor Swift won favorite country music female artist, her 11th AMA trophy.  Electronic dance music, known as EDM, was added as a category this year. The first award was bestowed on David Guetta.  Other winners included Katy Perry for favorite pop/rock female artist; Maroon 5 for favorite pop/rock band, duo or group; Lady Antebellum for favorite country music band, duo or group; Usher for favorite soul/R&B male artist; Beyonce for favorite soul/R&B female artist; Rihanna for favorite soul/R&B album; Linkin Park for favorite alternative rock artist; Adele for favorite adult contemporary artist; Shakira for favorite latin music artist; and tobyMac for favorite contemporary inspirational artist.  Among the 18 performances, one of the more noteworthy was Pink's delivery of "Try," a song about domestic abuse, as an acrobatic ballet.  CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.

How can it be that we are firmly into the 21st century and reading claims that birth control pills can cause prostate cancer and abort babies? Or, my personal favorite, that a woman can be considered pregnant before her egg unites with a sperm?  Such falsehoods are being touted not by yahoos but by educated conservatives who, in growing numbers, choose to ignore what science tells them.  According to a paper in a recent American Sociological Review, conservatives with at least a bachelor's degree have, over the last several decades, lost their faith in science to an amazing degree. Although the paper doesn't cite advances in contraception specifically, they are clearly one victim of this disaffection.  Our country's top health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, counts contraception as one of the 10 greatest health achievements of the 20th century. Yet recently: A state legislator from New Hampshire, opposed to insurance companies being required to pay for birth control, called attention to a report suggesting that birth control pills cause prostate cancer. (Certain drugs in those pills become waste and eventually pass into the environment, according to the report, exposing men to carcinogens.)  The representative based her statement on findings that originally appeared in the British Medical Journal, findings that one author of the study later characterized as only a hypothesis, and were seriously questioned in a subsequent BMJ article. Some members of Congress, in their attempt to derail legislation requiring insurers, including the insurers of some religious organizations, to cover birth control, falsely argued that Plan B, the "morning after" pill taken after sex in order to avoid pregnancy, causes abortions.  It does not, nor do other methods of contraception, James N. Martin, Jr., president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, pointed out in a letter to the editor in USA Today. "The definition of contraception is to prevent pregnancy, which occurs at implantation," he wrote.  The morning-after pill is often confused with another drug, RU-486, which, he said, does induce abortion and is therefore not considered contraception. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law a bill prohibiting abortions that occur 20 weeks after a woman's last period begins. (This is in contrast to starting the 20-week count about two weeks later, when fertilization likely occurs.) As Amanda Marcotte notes in RH Reality Check, Arizona conservatives, in effect, said that women could be pregnant before egg and sperm unite.  Apparently they were dozing off during ninth-grade biology.  Not all political conservatives are Flat Earthers, of course. But there are proportionately more of them than there used to be, according to the Review article. For that piece, Gordon Gauchat, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, analyzed information from the General Social Survey, conducted every year since 1972 by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago.  He found that in 1974, the year Republican Gerald Ford became president, 48% of conservatives trusted science, a higher proportion, interestingly, than found among liberals or moderates.  By 2010, however, that number had fallen to 34%, while the degree of trust among moderates and liberals remained stable. Of particular note: Confidence dropped among conservatives who held bachelor's degrees, not those who only finished high school.  Gauchat theorized that because educated conservatives are more politically engaged than other voting blocs, they are more likely to seek information that conforms to their ideology. As the Los Angeles Times, writing about Gauchat's work, pointed out, some of them have big money to spend spreading their ideas.  "Right-wing think tanks, funded by corporate interests to undermine the scientific consensus on such expensive-to-fix phenomena as climate change, have proliferated, as have conservative cable-TV networks, blogs and radio talk shows," the Times noted. "These outlets are talking to a well-educated audience. And they're presenting a very one-sided view of scientific issues."  Gauchat also wrote about the influence of the religious right, "which rejects scientific contradictions of religious teachings on such issues as evolution and stem-cell research, and the growing use of science to inform public policy in such areas as environmental protection."  "Conservatives, ever wary of government interference with the free market, started to resent the scientists. ... Rather than debate remedies, they have turned on science itself. ... (They) really have their own subculture, complete with ontological claims about what the world is about."  Here's what the world is really about when it comes to using birth control: Women, notably millennials, the largest generation ever, are pursuing higher education, jobs and careers, having sex and bearing children, all according to a timetable that works best for them, their partners and their babies.  They couldn't do this if birth control wasn't accessible, affordable and safe. Demonizing it amounts to telling these women to throw out their briefcases and take up their vacuum cleaners. Conservative opposition to contraception has a last-gasp ring to it, and most Americans know that.  One indication is a poll recently published by the Public Religion Research Institute, a think tank supported by a broad spectrum of scientists and religious experts. The poll showed a majority of Americans, including a majority of Catholics, believe that most employers should be required to provide their employees with health care plans that cover contraception at no cost.  Another sign of change is the perceptible ease with which young men talk about and support contraception, including methods being developed for them.  Nick Halzack, a 23-year-old policy intern working in Washington, says he looks forward to the day when male birth control, in various testing stages around the country, goes on the market.  "My generation has always had contraception," he says. "It was a part of our sex education and is a part of our relationships. We are just beginning to get engaged in the politics, and the fight against it is a losing battle."  The opinions used in this commentary are solely those of Laura Sessions Stepp.  
 Rescuers have saved 110 people from a ship that capsized in the waters between Australia and Indonesia and are searching for the many missing, an Australian official said Friday.  The boat, that was carrying about 200 people, flipped over Thursday, authorities said, triggering the massive rescue effort.  A 13-year-old boy was one of the many rescued, Australia Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  The others that were rescued were all adults, Clare said. Authorities believe all the passengers in the ship were male, according to Clare.  The survivors were being transported to Christmas Island.  "Over the course of 36 hours from the time the boat capsized, my advice is that people can survive out there if they've got either life jackets or they are able to hold onto debris, as a lot of people did through the course of yesterday," Clare said. "So the window is still there where we hold out the prospect of finding more people alive."  On Thursday, authorities said the vessel was 110 nautical miles northwest of Christmas Island. Indonesia has sent two warships to assist Australian rescue efforts.  And Clare said four more ships would be in the area Friday to help the ships and aircraft that are already searching.  Christmas Island has been the scene of another recent boat capsizing.  At least 28 people died in December 2010 when a boat carrying asylum seekers crashed into cliffs near the coast of the island.  Most of the people on the boat were from Iran and Iraq, a rescue worker said at the time.

A mother and her young son were at a mall, when she considered buying him a sandwich. She knew her husband would beat her later for spending the $7, but her son was hungry. She swallowed her fear and bought the sandwich.  I met a college professor with a PhD who told me that her husband took her paycheck every month and that she had to wear long sleeves in the summer to hide the bruises on her arms.  When a person tells you these very personal, gut-wrenching stories, you can't help but be moved to act. Still, many people hear these stories and they ask, "Why does she stay?" I've learned that getting away is never easy. There are children to consider. Emotional ties are hard to break. Oftentimes women simply don't have the money because money is a weapon of choice for many domestic violence perpetrators.  The National Network to End Domestic Violence reports that financial abuse almost always accompanies physical abuse and can be the primary obstacle to women breaking free from bondage. It works like this: A man (women are the victims in 85% of cases) sets up a credit card in the woman's name and doesn't pay the bills, ruining the woman's credit. The man forces the woman to put her paycheck into a bank account and won't give her access. He hides all financial documents and won't share passwords for websites.  So, the woman often has no money, poor credit, and a limited understanding of her financial situation. Even if she is desperate to leave an abusive partner and has the courage to move to a local domestic violence shelter, she has no money for transportation, food or clothing.  So, the right question isn't: "Why does she stay?" The right question is: "How can we help her get safe and secure?"  Evidence shows that arming victims with the right tools and information can help. Victims need to protect and reclaim their financial resources, rebuild their credit and gain a complete understanding of their financial picture.  According to a long-term study by The Center for Violence Against Women and Children at Rutgers University, abused women who participated in a financial education curriculum developed by The Allstate Foundation and the National Network to End Domestic Violence were twice as likely to take the financial steps necessary to rebuild their lives.  The sheer scope of domestic violence overall in this country almost defies belief. Data from the Centers for Disease Control shows that one in four women will be a victim of domestic abuse in their lifetime. The CDC also reports that 2 million women are injured in the U.S. every year and that domestic abuse leads to 8 million lost days of work annually. Polling by the Allstate Foundation has shown that almost three quarters of us know a victim, even though few of us realize it.  The U.S. Department of Justice has stated that approximately 1,300 die annually from domestic violence. The United States Conference of Mayors argues that it is the No. 1 cause of homelessness for women, and the violence scars millions of children each year who witness it. Yet, few want to talk about it because it is a dark and ugly subject.  The NFL has given us all an opportunity to have deeper conversations about domestic violence. But it shouldn't take a high-profile incident in the news for us to rise up and take a stand against domestic violence. We must seize the opportunity to bring domestic violence and financial abuse out of the shadows and help women trapped in abusive relationships find the path to safety.  Business needs to take domestic violence very seriously. We need more businesses to step up and play an active role in protecting women. Wherever possible, businesses should take into account extenuating circumstances such as domestic violence when considering credit histories and ratings.  Companies should make sure employee benefit plans provide a helping hand when needed. Managers should be trained on how best to identify and support employees who are victims of abuse at home.  In addition, all of us can rise up, including role models in sports and entertainment, academia, educators and concerned citizens. Only by pulling back the curtain and getting involved can we ensure that victims can escape to a safer and brighter future.  Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.  
 Erik Prince, the chairman and CEO of Blackwater USA, appeared Tuesday before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.  Erik Prince, CEO and chairman of Blackwater USA, is sworn in Tuesday at a congressional hearing.  The committee convened amid an FBI investigation into a September 16 shootout involving Blackwater personnel that resulted in the deaths of Iraqi civilians.  Following is a transcript of Prince's opening statement:  Chairman [Henry] Waxman, [D-California], Congressman [Thomas] Davis, [R-Virginia], members of the committee, my name is Eric Prince, and I am the chairman and CEO of the Prince Group and Blackwater USA.  Blackwater's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to America's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect Americans in harm's way overseas.  Under the direction and oversight of the United States government, Blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the United States.  Words alone cannot express the respect I have for these brave men and women who defendwho volunteer to defend U.S. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions. I am proud to be there to represent them today.  After almost five years in active service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, I founded Blackwater in 1997. I wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues. Ten years later, Blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the United States military and law enforcement agencies every day.  After 9/11, when the U.S. began its stabilization efforts in Afghanistan and then Iraq, the United States government called upon Blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas. Blackwater responded immediately. We are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country.  Blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans, many of whom have recent military deployments. No individual ever protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured. There is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men.  At the same time, 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for Blackwater and its affiliates. Numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed. The entire Blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families.  The areas of Iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging. Blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within Iraq. We're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 American military personnel and thousands of innocent Iraqis.  Any incident where Americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep American officials and dignitaries safe, including visiting members of Congress.  In doing so, more American service members are available to fight the enemy.  Blackwater shares the committee's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting U.S. operations.  The company's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes, treaties and regulations of the United States. Blackwater looks forward to working with Congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented.  The worldwide personnel protection services contract, which has been provided to this committee, was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance, including the hiring, vetting guidelines, background checks, screening, training standards, rules of force and conduct standards.  In Iraq, Blackwater reports to the embassy's regional security officer, or RSO. All Blackwater movements and operations are directed by the RSO. In conjunction with internal company procedures and controls, the RSO ensures that Blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions, as well as any applicable laws and regulations.  We have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in Iraq as part of our nation's total force. Blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions.  My understanding of the September 16 incident is that the Department of State and the FBI are conducting a full investigation, but those results are not yet available. We at Blackwater welcome the FBI review announced yesterday, and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions.  I just want to put some other things in perspective.  A recent report from the Department of State stated that in 2007 Blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone, areas outside the Green Zone in Iraq, and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged, or less than 3 percent of all movements.  In 2006, Blackwater conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the Red Zone. Weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions.  To the extent there is any loss of innocent life, ever, let me be clear that I consider that tragic. Every life, whether American or Iraqi, is precious. I stress to the committee and to the American public, however, that I believe we acted appropriately at all times.  I am prepared to answer your questions. E-mail to a friend

Tiger Woods is no longer officially considered one of golf's top 50 players, ending a streak that extended back 15 years.  According to the official World Golf Ranking, the 35-year-old Woods entered the weekend as the sport's 50th best player. But he lost that standing when Louis Oosthuizen finished tied for fifth at this weekend's Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland, earning him a place in the standings and ousting Woods.  The rankings are endorsed by Professional Golf Association tours in the United States, Europe, Australia, Asia and elsewhere, according to the World Golf Ranking website. An updated ranking comes out every Monday.  The last time Woods was not among the top 50 was on October 13, 1996. Since then, he won 14 major championshipsa distinction used for the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA championshipand, for much of the next 778 weeks, ranked as the game's best player.  In recent years, Woods has been plagued by the fallout surrounding his infidelity and divorce from his wife as well as numerous injuries. His last tournament win was the Australian Masters in November 2009.  His next competition will be this week at the Frys.com Open in Corde Valley, California. Despite his recent slump, American team captain Fred Couples chose Woods as one of his wild card picks for next month's Presidents Cup in Australia.  CNN's Jason Durand contributed to this report.  
  Esra'a al Shafei, a recent university graduate in Bahrain, is young, Muslim and frustrated.  Young Muslims, pictured here in Afghanistan, are increasingly using technology to engage the world.  The 23-year-old says the complexity of who she is as a Muslim is being distorted by extremists and the media coverage of them.  Channeling her frustration, she started Mideastyouth.com, a Web site she describes as a place for young people in the region to "show a different side of our religion" and discuss topics big and small, taboo and not.  She represents a generation of Muslims who are using technology to express themselves, connect with others, challenge traditional power structures and create an identity in an era when Islamic extremists often grab the headlines.  "I think the word that clearly defines the younger generation and also separates them from their parents is 'globalized,'" said Reza Aslan, the author of two books on Islam, including the recently published "How to Win a Cosmic War: God, Globalization and the End of the War on Terror."  Access to technology lags in countries with large Muslim populations compared with Europe and the United States. Access also varies between those countries depending on a variety of factors such as governmental control and economic development.  But the numbers of people using the Web and cell phones are growingand quickly. "The percentage increases of Internet users in places like Iran, Pakistan and Egypt are astronomical during the past five years," Aslan said.  A recent study by Forrester Research predicted growth rates for Web usage would continue to soar in the region during the next five years.  A battle over interpretation  Al Shafei, who spoke to CNN by phone from Bahrain, said her Islamic identity was partly shaped by a childhood that included Christian classmates and American and British teachers.  She also grew up in a country that was relatively progressive enough to appoint a female Jewish ambassador recently. "Islam is much more relaxed here," she said. "But it doesn't mean we're not good Muslims."  She discovered blogs, and the more she read, the more she grew frustrated with the nature of the dialogue. "No one was talking to each other," she said.  The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006 was the turning point for her. "I was really annoyed by how the Western and Arab media were covering it," she said. "Both sides were sticking to the extremes."  She said she started her Web site that year to provide the worldand mediaa different perspective on Islam. "We're not as simplistic as the media would often make of us," she said.  Al Shafei said the Web site's discussion subjects range from the political to the taboo, including homosexuality, premarital sex and atheism. The anonymity provided by the Web helps foster such discussion, she said.  She is, however, careful to avoid talking about some topics, which could get her in trouble. "I always remind myself that I have my limitations," she said. "There are various issues that I am unable to tackle for security reasons."  Al Shafei said she hopes that Web sites such as hers could help fight extremist Islamic groups by defeating their arguments through cultural and religious dialogue. But she concedes there's catching up to do.  "We have to move faster" because extremist groups are more widespread in traditional media such as newspapers and radio stations, which are still consumed by more people than new media such as Web sites, she said.  The extremists' lure  Some extremists are adept at using technology and new media as well. The killings of journalist Daniel Pearl, U.S. businessman Nicholas Berg and Eugene Armstrong, an American contractor working in Iraq, were all recorded and later broadcast on the Web.  It's long been a concern that the Web is being used by extremist groups such as al Qaeda to recruit young Muslims to their cause. However, Bruce Etling, who co-authored recent studies of the Arabic and Persian blogospheres at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society, said he found little evidence of such activity.  "In the Arabic blogosphere we found no specific clusters related to extremism, and when it was discussed, it tended to be in negative terms," he said. "It was a counter-narrative we were surprised to find."  There are several possible reasons why, he explained. It's difficult for extremist groups to maintain a static presence on the Webthey constantly have to move to avoid being found.  Additionally, popular sites such as Facebook have strict terms of usage, which make it difficult for extremist groupsand their sympathizersto build a following.  Aslan, who is also the executive editor of the social-networking Web site Mecca.com, said that research has consistently shown that the Internet is not an effective recruiting tool for extremists. He said extremist groups use the Web more as a marketing and communication tool.  "Nobody, absolutely nobody, straps a bomb on their body because they were recruited from the Internet," he said. "It takes an enormous amount of personal face-to-face contact and time in order to recruit a young person into the cause of jihad."  The Web and the streets  Observers say that like other young people around the world, Muslims mostly use technology such as cell phones and the Web for social and recreational reasons, not political.  Jared Cohen traveled through the Middle East from 2004 through 2006 for his book, "Children of Jihad: A Young American's Travels Among the Youth of the Middle East." He joined the U.S. State Department in September, 2006.  He said his travels showed him that the same tools young Muslims are using to socialize also are helping them organize.  While at an underground party in Iran a few years ago, he asked the Iranians how they heard about the gathering. They told him that if he were to go to the marketplace during the day and turn on his Bluetooth, he could receive random messages with details on where to go and at what time.  Western-style parties and music are prohibited in Iran, so young people hold them secretly to evade security.  Cohen said the partygoers were dismissive when asked if they were afraid of the security forces finding out. "No one over 30 knows what Bluetooth does," the young Iranians told him.  That knowledge and tech savviness played a significant role in the recent protests after the disputed Iranian election. Protesters used Twitter, cell phones and other social-networking tools to organize and spread word of what was happening on the streets.  The impact on Islam: A new identity?  The post-election fallout in Iran is one example that portends a broader generational and hierarchical struggle in the Muslim community, some experts say.  There are a lot of young Muslims. By some estimates, about 60 percent of Muslims in the Middle East are under the age of 30.  "What the printing press is to Christianity in the 16th century, that's what the Internet is doing to Islam now," Aslan said. "It has opened up the monopoly over the interpretation of Islam that used to solely belong to the religious class."  Some clerical authorities, well aware of the challenges posed to their influence by the powers of the Web, are becoming more tech savvy and are building a digital presence, Aslan says.  But their interpretations and authority increasingly have competition from sites created by young Muslims such as al Shafei and online communities found on Facebook and Twitter.  However, emerging technology also could be a force that helps forge a new, more global Islamic identity. Syrian Muslims can now talk to Muslims in Pakistan, Indonesia, the U.S. or Europe.  "During the 20th century, the parents of this generation were struggling to define for themselves some conception of a pan-Arab or pan-Muslim unity," Aslan said. "But that was elusive because there are so many things geopolitically that separate the Muslim world.  "With the Internet, those boundaries, those borders are irrelevant."

The first thing you notice about New York's Ellis Island hospital is its sheer scale. Twenty-two buildings are perched proudly on the island's south side, their original vocations ranging from maternity ward, to psychiatric unit, to the contagious disease wing.  The Ellis Island hospital complex, used between 1902 and 1930, was where immigrants were checked before being allowed onshore. Here, within view of the Statue of Liberty, babies were born, people died, and a constant stream of patients with new illnesses arrived.  It was the biggest public health initiative the U.S. had ever attempted and now, it is open to the public for the first time in 60 years.  The hospital's record is impressive. No epidemic on the U.S. mainland was ever attributed to an immigrant that came through its checking system.  "There were fears of epidemics" the museum historian Barry Moreno told me. Cholera had broken out in New York in the 1890s, and "there were fears of smallpox...and typhus. But there was no epidemic that ever stemmed from here." The hospital, he added, "played a very big role in screening immigrants."  The second thing that hits you is the hospital complex's authenticity. It looks like the dust has settled on a fire drill, from which no one returned.  Single stools are left overturned. Buckets are left on top of closets, and bed frames lie rusty but intact in corners.  The complex has survived extreme elements. Two years ago hurricane Sandy crippled the north side of the Island, closing the immigration museum there for a year. But the hospital stood firm, testament to a time when buildings were built "very sturdily," Moreno says.  One of the volunteer tour guides at the hospital, Tony Mrozinski, takes me into the morgue, where raked concrete benches tower over the area where autopsy tables once stood. "People always ask me," he says, "when the concrete was restored. I tell them: 'it wasn't.'"  The third thing you notice is what makes this place so addictive to the curious visitor. It's the blend of adversity and opportunity. Patients were subject to suffering and humiliation, but they received top-class treatment and the opportunity of a new life.  Ellis Island has been described as an island of hope, an island of tearsand the two fit in the same breath. This is not only a halfway house between origin and destination, but between captivity and free will, sickness and health.  As part of its opening, the hospital French artist JR has created an installation inside its brick maze. JR has taken original photographs of the patients and doctors that walked its corridors, enlarging them to life-size and pasting them on the crumbling walls, windows and doors.  Janis Calella, president of the government-funded Save Ellis Island group, says the use of historic photographs and their placement through the hospital "evoke some sort of an emotion," making it easier to support the work.  Permanent exhibitions are not permitted by the National Parks Service, which runs Ellis Island, and the images can be peeled off if required. However, there are no plans to do so, Calella says. The exhibition "will last here for as long as it lasts." she says.  
 WASHINGTON A third of military children surveyed who have a parent deployed in a war zone are at "high risk" for psychological problems, according to a new study by military doctors and researchers.  The study concludes there's a greater chance of family problems upon a military parent's return.  The study, published in the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, surveyed military spouses of deployed Army soldiers with school-age children, aged 5 to 12. The questionnaire appraised the strain on the family of dealing with a parent deployed to the war zone.  Results found that stress levels were high for children and spouses of deployed troops but also that support networks from military to religious helped mitigate the problems.  The number of children found to be high-risk is more than 2 times the national level and higher than historical military samples.  The authors surveyed 101 families in what they said was the first such evaluation since September 11, 2001, and the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Overall, there are more than 2 million U.S. military children, many of whom have parents who have deployed multiple timesdeployments that, for the first time since the Vietnam War, can occur as little as 12 months after returning from a previous deployment.  The study focused on families of active-duty soldiers living on base at Fort Lewis, Washington, and is just a "small snapshot," said one of the authors, Col. Beth Ellen Davis. She is the chief of Developmental Services at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington.  Davis said that more studies would have to be done to understand the impact on military children in other circumstances, like those with parents in other services, living off-base or in the National Guard, but that the results point to a problem nobody could deny.  "Children struggle when their parents deploy. I don't think anyone will struggle with that," Davis said.  The survey quantified what Davis had seen anecdotally in her work at the hospital.  "My perception in the school-age range and pre-school-age range was that how the at-home parent is doing is most predictive of how the child is coping," Davis said.  Almost half of the spouses surveyed were found to have a high level of stress, which the authors say has a significant impact on their child's ability to cope.  Parents surveyed said their children experienced a number of symptoms including "internalizing symptoms" like anxiety, frequent crying and worrying.  Interestingly, it is the return from deployment that is most stressful, according to three-quarters of those surveyed.  "On reunification, there is excitement, anticipation and relief, occasionally followed by emotional conflict as the service member reintegrates back into the family," wrote the surveyors.  Effects of deployment on families can be seen beyond the Fort Lewis survey.  At Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, Gia Ellis' husband is deployed to Afghanistan for the second time. The mother of two said the return home is as stressful as the deployment itself.  "Trying to relinquish some of the responsibilities that we've had to take on and give it back to them," Ellis said last month. She was not a participant in the stress survey. "Letting go is very difficult. Very difficult to share the responsibility with your spouse and, 'Oh, yeah, you're in this family? I forgot.' "  Ellis said that this deployment has been easier on her in part because she is living on the base and has access to a support network of wives and staff.  The strain on families during the reintegration has parallels to families with spouses who travel a lot for business, said Frederic Medway, distinguished professor emeritus of psychology at  the University of South Carolina.  Medway, who has studied the effects of family integration in military and non-military families, agreed with the new study's conclusion that there is a greater chance of family problems when the spouse comes back.  "That is when the husband and wife actually fight and talk about stuff," Medway said. "The service member comes back and doesn't feel a part of it and returns with his own baggage."  Much work still needs to be done to assess how these psychological effects play out over time, Medway said. His studies on families of the first Gulf War found that reintegration problems played out in a period lasting around six months to year.  Medway said that it is hard to compare studies from different wars but that duration does point to a key problem in the current conflicts, since many troops are redeploying after a year, meaning the family never really gets a chance to settle back down.  One surprising result of the new study was what factors were predictors of high-risk impact. Parents with a college education were less likely to have children at risk, and younger parents fared worse. Those with college education who were also employed had significantly less stress, which the study authors suggested could be a result of having access to additional support networks, adult interactions and income to relieve stress.  Length of deployment, military rank and children's age did not have an impact.  Medway said that one reason for the effect of education could be that those in lower social classes tend to deal with more mental health and marital issues in general.  "How far is the rubber band going to stretch?" Medway asked. Pre-existing problems are compounded by deployment.  Davis, co-author of the Fort Lewis-based survey, said that what the study revealed was that those feeling the brunt of the stress were younger families, which are the bulk of enlisted soldiers.  "What comes with enlistment is usually junior-ranking high-school graduates getting by enough to support a family but often times not (to) support child care outside the home," Davis explained. That demographic has higher stress because they lack support networks.  Davis said the study highlights the need to understand the impact of deployment on these at risk groups and make sure they have the support they need and "not assuming that everyone has the same needs."  She noted that there are resources for families and that more effort is being made to reach out to those who most need help "whether they ask for it or not."

WASHINGTON After touring the wreckage Tuesday of two Metro transit trains that crashed the day before, killing nine, Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty said it was a sight that "no one should have to see."  Investigators work Tuesday at the site of a Metro train crash in Washington.  Officials said that all the wreckage has been cleared and that no other bodies have been found in what was the worst subway train accident in the history of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.  Three bodies discovered Tuesday were lodged behind the driver's compartment of the rear train, an official said at the scene.  The driver of that train, who was among the dead, was Jeanice McMillan, 42, of Springfield, Virginia, Metro spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said. McMillan had worked at Metro since January 2007.  McMillan's aunt, Venice Foster, said her niece loved her job and "was just a joy to be around."  Retired Maj. Gen. David F. Wherley Jr., former commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, and his wife, Ann, also were killed in the collision. Both were 62.  Names of the other casualties were released by authorities Tuesday afternoon: Mary Doolittle, 59; Lavanda King, 23; Veronica Dubose, 26; Cameron Williams, 36; and Dennis Hawkins, 64, all of Washington; and Ana Fernandez, 40, of Hyattsville, Maryland.  Watch what officials know about the crash   The Metro's board approved a $250,000 hardship fund to assist the victims' families with funerals and other immediate expenses.  According to Fenty, at least three bodies were trapped in a "very compressed area." It wasn't clear whether those were the bodies found behind the operator's station.  "It just brings home what an awful tragedy this was," the mayor said.  The crash occurred along the Red Line just before 5 p.m. Monday on an above-ground track in the District of Columbia near Takoma Park, Maryland.  See location of crash   Both cars were on the same track, traveling in the same direction: southward from the Fort Totten Metrorail station to the Shady Grove station. The train in front had stopped behind another train undergoing service and awaited directions to move ahead.  "We don't know at this point whether the operator could see the train in front of her in time to stop," said Deborah Hersman, who is leading the investigation for the National Transportation Safety Board.  The weather at the time of the crash was good, she said.  See pictures of crash site   "I did have the opportunity to walk the track with our investigators. I can tell you it is a scene of real devastation," Hersman said.  Jamie Jiao was sitting in the front car of the second train. He said he suffered injuries to his feet and back.  "I see the train in front a split second before we crashed. That's all. You don't have time to react or do anything," he told CNN's Jeanne Meserve.  He said that after impact, "You just hear really loud noises, as if there was an explosion. I could see things falling apart, tearing apart."  A pole fell on top of him, but he was able to throw it off. The car broke open, and he crawled outside, where he waited for firefighters. He said he didn't notice whether the driver tried to brake before hitting the other train.  Many of the passengers in his car were injured, he said.  "I'm lucky to be alive," Jiao said. "My injuries aren't too bad." iReport.com: Were you there? Share your photos, video  Hersman said there was a telescoping effect when the second car slammed into the first and landed atop it.  "The first car [of the second train] overrode the rear car [of the front train], and much of the survivable space on that first car of the striking train was compromised," she said.  One of the factors the NTSB will examine is the crash-worthiness of the cars.  "The safety board has long been on record making recommendations about survivability when accidents do happen to make sure that operators and passengers are protected as much as possible," Hersman said, but those haven't been implemented. She didn't elaborate.  The safety board has called since 2006 for the transit authority to modernize its fleet of transit cars. The agency has sought more safety features and higher technology, such as data boxes on each car that can provide valuable information in case of a crash, Hersman said.  Citing the most recent federal data, she said the average age of the cars in the fleet was 19.3 years old.  The lead train in the crash contained 5000-Series and 3000-Series cars, which are newer and have better technology than the cars in the rear train, with 1000-Series cars.  Watch woman say she, fellow passengers "went flying"   The Metro board is "aggressively seeking" to replace 300 1000-Series cars purchased between 1974 and 1978, said Jim Graham, chairman of Metro's board of directors.  There should be nine data recorders aboard the first train, which will aid the investigation a great deal if they aren't damaged, Hersman said. The recorders provide data on such things as speed, braking and emergency applications. She said there were no recorders on the rear train.  "We've recommended for years that WMATA either retrofit those cars or phase them out of the fleet. They have not been able to do that. And our recommendation was not addressed, so it has been closed in an unacceptable status," she said.  "If there are changes we can make to those cars, we will do so," said John Catoe Jr., general manager of the transit authority.  Fenty said 76 people were injured, and two remained in critical condition Tuesday. The condition of another critical patient was upgraded. Two of the injured were emergency responders, Washington Fire Chief Dennis Rubin said.  Watch injured passengers limp from the scene   All trains were to operate in manual, instead of automatic, mode Tuesday, Catoe said at the briefing. He called the move "an extra safety precaution" until there is more information on the crash.  The rear train was operating on "automatic" mode, which is routine during rush hour, and preliminary evidence shows that the driver may have employed the brakes, Hersman said.  Hersman addressed reports that the trains may have been two months past due on brake inspections, saying, "We are very interested in looking at those records, and we're interested in looking at all of the records."  She said cell phone and texting records would also be reviewed, which is standard.  "We've investigated a number of accidents where there were distractions," she said, adding that it's unknown whether cell phone use was a factor in this crash.  Nine safety board teams will examine aspects such as train operations and communications, signals, tracks, crash-worthiness of equipment, maintenance and survivabilityease of fleeing the trains after the crash and other survivability factors, Hersman said.  The transit authority gave Red Line riders several options for commuting Tuesday morning and was providing free shuttle buses to drive people around the accident scene.  The only other time in Metrorail's 33-year history that there were customer fatalities was in January 1982, when three people died as a result of a derailment between the Federal Triangle and Smithsonian Metrorail stations.  In 2004, two trains collided at the Woodley Park/Zoo-Adams Morgan Metrorail station. There were minor injuries.  
 The family of New York bus monitor Karen Kleinwho has gained sympathy worldwide after a video of seventh-graders brutally taunting her while on the job went viral this weekis asking for the harassment of the children to stop.  "Between all of us, we don't feel that's right by any means," Klein's daughter, Amanda Romig, told CNN on Friday. "We would like people to stop harassing the family and the kids. That's another form of bullying."  The video recorded by a fellow student sparked a storm of criticism against the boys, who attend middle school in the Rochester suburb of Greece.  The father of 13-year-old Wesley, one of the four boys involved in the incident, told CNN his son is "pretty depressed" and "somewhat in shock" by the level of attention the video has received and the vitriol directed at the students.  "I think the lesson's learned," he told Anderson Cooper. "This whole thing that we've been through is going to scar our family for life. This is life-changing. ... I don't see this ever happening again."  The family has received "numerous death threats," the father said, as well as people coming to their house and banging on the door after their phone number and address were posted on the Internet.  "It's gotten to the point where we don't want to leave the house," he said, describing the atmosphere as "very tense."  Greece police Capt. Steve Chatterton also called for the harassment to stop, even while acknowledging that police, too, "felt everyone's pain" in watching the video.  "There's not going to be a whole lot of remorse for the children," he said Thursday. "And people aren't going to feel real sorry for them. But they've received death threats. We've received 911 calls to their home saying someone was holding them hostage. That's not funny, that's a crime, that's a form of bullying."  Meanwhile, Klein continues to adjust to the attention and emotions spurred by the video's posting. Supporters worldwide have donated more than $575,000 online so far through the international crowd-funding site, Indiegogo.com. The site launched the effort to send Klein on vacation after the video surfaced. And Southwest Airlines announced this week that it would send her and nine others on an all-expense-paid trip to Disneyland.  Klein told CNN she's thinking about quitting her job and doing volunteer work after some supporters suggested the donations were enough for retirement.  "I thought, 'That's not a bad idea!' " she said.  She's also weighing donating some of the money to organizations benefiting autism and Down syndrome causes, said Romig, her daughter. Klein wants to raise awareness because of family members with autism and Down syndrome, who might also be victims of bullying, Romig said.  As for her own bullies, Wesley's father visited her on Thursday to express his apologies and his mother wrote a note "to say how sorry she was and how sick it made her to see that her son was involved in this," according to Romig.  "I think he was sincere," Klein said of the father's visit, but expressed doubt over the apologies she's gotten so far from some of the boys. "I don't really think they're sorry. Sorry they got caught, yes, that would be more like it."  Klein said one boy wanted to come to her home to speak with her, "But I said no, because I wasn't ready to look at his face."  But she added that may change after she's able to get away on the trip provided by Southwest: She's taking her two daughters and six grandchildren to Disneyland.  CNN's Maggie Leung and David Puente contributed to this report.

Much of the world has been stunned by the huge increase of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean this year, increasing the number of deaths at sea by a factor of 30 compared to the same time last year. Almost all the deaths have occurred in the perilous central Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy.  The flows of migrants across the Mediterranean are unlikely to stopItalian authorities estimate that up to 200,000 migrants in Libya are waiting to cross, following 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived in Italy last year. These flows reflect a significant increase in the number of refugees and internally displaced people across the world, with a total estimate of 51.2 million people.  The latest sinking has triggered some action in the European Union, which has unveiled a new ten-point action plan. The plan includes both deterrent mechanisms, such as efforts to capture and destroy vessels being used by smugglers and a rapid return system, but also an expansion of search-and-rescue programs and a proposed new voluntary resettlement scheme, though it is reported that this may only provide 5,000 spaces.  But some EU critics called for much tougher action to deter asylum seekers from making the risky journey. In a column published in the UK's Sun newspaper just hours before the sinking, Katie Hopkins declared: "It's time to get Australian. Bring on the gunships, force migrants back to their shores and burn the boats."  Since then, Australia's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, has also suggested that Europe adopt a tougher approach, saying, "The only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the people smuggling trade. The only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats... That's why it is so urgent that the countries of Europe adopt very strong policies that will end the people smuggling trade across the Mediterranean."  So what would it mean if the EU did "get Australian" in its approach to asylum seekers? And could Australia's current policy be used as a global solution, or at least one for asylum seekers trying to cross the Mediterranean?  There were dramatic changes in Australia's immigration policy in 2013, in the final months of the Labor government, led by Kevin Rudd, which have been followed up and taken further by the current Liberal National coalition government, led by Abbott.  In 2013, with bipartisan support of those two major parties, mainland Australia was legally "excised" from the migration zone. It was done so that anyone arriving without a visa by boat would not be processed in Australia.  All people who seek to enter Australia by sea, under the Asylum Legacy Act, are no longer entitled to enter or stay in Australia while their refugee claims are processed. Instead, they can be transported to detention facilities in Papua New Guinea or Nauru. Alternatively, under a recent agreement, they can also agree to move to Cambodia.  Beyond this, the Abbott government has also returned some boats to Indonesia without processing asylum seeker claims and, in two instances, to Sri Lanka following a very brief teleconference interview with the asylum seekers on board. That process was widely condemned by human rights advocates, given ongoing human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.  That shift in policy under successive Labor and now the Liberal National governments in Australia has been chiefly designed as a deterrent: or, to use Tony Abbott's slogan, to "stop the boats". So has it worked?  First, the numbers. If your sole criteria for success is the number of boats arriving in Australia each year, then "no advantage" (meaning no asylum in Australia) and "stop the boats" (including the turning back of boats in international waters) has worked. In 2013, the Australian government reported that 300 boats with approximately 20,000 people on board arrived; in 2014, there were 0.  The current government has argued that its objective was to end the people smuggling tradeand this required secrecy concerning the extent of its operations and turn-backs. So we do not know how many boats tried to enter Australian waters with asylum seekers.  It also appears that no asylum seekers drowned in Australian waters during the 2013-2014 period. Abbott explained the tactic of secrecy and turn-back in the following statement: "We are in a fierce contest with these people smugglers. And if we were at war, we wouldn't be giving out information that is of use to the enemy just because we might have an idle curiosity about it ourselves."  If we accept that these responses have worked, the question for Australia's government is whether it is sustainable, and whether it alleviating the flow of asylum seekers in the larger Asia Pacific region. In sum, if this policy had to end due to its financial cost, has this policy been a "solution"?  The later years of the Howard administration saw both policy and budget departures from 2001's "Pacific Solution," which first introduced the excision zones and temporary protection visas as deterrents to asylum seekers.  The Rudd government abandoned temporary protection visas altogether but retained the excision zones; this occurred in a period of heightened regional instability, leading to an increase of asylum seekers under the Rudd era. The earlier Howard years of deterrence did not provide long-term solutions regarding the regional flow of asylum seekers.  At present, in the greater South-East Asian region, we may see potential regional pressures finding a way to Australian shores. The drowning of asylum seekers who sought passage via people smugglers appear to have increased, in particular, in the Bay of Bengal. At the same time, the number of asylum seekers attempting to flee within the Asia Pacific region has increased; they are just not making it to Australia yet.  On cost alone, it is hard to see Australia's approach to asylum seekers working or being affordable in Europe. For Australia, these short-term solutions have been extraordinarily expensive.  A 2014 report by the Guardian estimated that the Australian government may have spent as much as A$10 billion ($7.72 billion) on its detention policies since mid-2007-- and that each person in offshore detention costs the government as much as A$440,000 ($343,000). For comparison, we estimate that a similar model to respond to the 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived last year in Italy would cost A$75 billion ($58.5 billion).  The Australian government's ability to "stop the boats"or at least keep asylum seekers offshoredepends on a number of factors, including tolerance from Indonesia, significant spending devoted to asylum deterrence and weathering international condemnation for violating the human rights of asylum seekers.  The consequences of a policy of no asylum and no refuge in Australia for those who arrived by boat from July 2013 has been asylum seekers placed in situations where they are vulnerable to abuse, as we saw with the death of an Iranian refugee in the Regional Processing Center on Manus Island and sexual and physical assault of asylum seekers held at the Regional Processing Center in Nauru.  The Australian government's interception of asylum seekers attempting to reach Australia by boat, and then their relocation to Nauru or Papua New Guinea (or perhaps Cambodia), does not remove or absolve the human rights obligations that Australia has to these populations.  The operation to stop and return the boats, called "Operation Sovereign Borders" has been politically tumultuous for Australia's relationship with Indonesia. Returning boats to international waters potentially violates Australia's obligation to international maritime law; push-backs to Indonesian waters violates Indonesia's sovereignty and has placed people at great risk.  In 2013 and 2014, the Australian government sought the Sri Lankan government's assistance to intercept those attempting to flee, and receive those who had already fled the country, at a time when that government was under investigation by the UN Human Rights Council for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  As the situation in Europe illustrates, just because people are not making it to your shoreline to seek asylum does not mean people stop attempting asylum.  In the short term, the "stop the boats" approach appears to be working for the Australian government. It is questionable whether this policy is financially or politically sustainable in the long term. It certainly has not ended people smuggling or people's attempts to seek asylum in the wider Asia-Pacific region.  Nando Sigona argues that the recent tragedy in Italy is not just about how to manage search and rescue operations, but requires consistent and long-term engagement with the root causes of refugee flows. This is a message that both the European Union and Australia should heed.  Italy is a good example of the failure of trying to stop asylum seekers with deterrence. The Italian government ended its Mare Nostrum search and rescue program last autumn, which was effective but was also costing the Italian government 9.5 million per month. It was replaced by a much smaller European Union-run program, Operation Triton, which has a smaller patrol area and a budget of less than a third that of Mare Nostrum.  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, has noted that this new program is totally inadequate and "more geared to border control and policing the seas than to saving lives".  In Italy, both Mare Nostrum and Operation Triton were stemming an inevitable tide given the political instability in North Africa. The migrants currently in Libya are in a perilous limbo, with a growing civil war having displaced more than 400,000 Libyans and with Human Rights Watch noting that the conflict and collapse of government authority has "eliminated any semblance of law and order from large parts of Libya."  Second, such policies have significant legal implications. The Australian High Court has ruled that these policies are legal as long as they take place outside of Australia's migration zone, an area that today includes all of Australian territory for the purposes of boat arrivals.  By contrast, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2012 that efforts by the Italian government to return migrants intercepted at sea to Libya violated its legal obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights because the migrants "were under the continuous and exclusive de jure and de facto control of the Italian authorities."  This suggests that similar practices to Australia's would be illegal under the European Convention.  Copyright 2015 The Conversation. Some rights reserved.  
 (The Frisky)Kate Gosselin has had some tough blows this year and Hugh Hefner has dealt her another one.  When asked if there was any possibility that Momzilla would grace the glossy covers of Playboy, Hef said, "No! No!" And the original playboy added insult to injury by suggesting he doesn't even know why she's on "Dancing with the Stars."  He explained, "I don't think she's a celebrity." She is the second Gosselin rejected from the porno business. It must hurt to hear that no one wants to check out your goody basket.  The Frisky: 10 famous female cheaters  Don't worry, Kate, you're not the only celebrity to fall short of Hef's stringent standards. You're not even the only celebrity on "DWTS" to be rejected! Here are some others who were told to "keep it on."  Audrina Patridge  Remember when Audrina Patridge "accidentally" leaked some topless photos and was "so embarrassed?" It turned out that she hired a photographer to do the photo shoot when she was 19 years old, to submit to Playboy, but they didn't want to publish the pics. I can't really imagine a better fit for the magazine. Maybe they just didn't dig the schoolgirl-in-her-parents-pool set-up?  The Frisky - 10 reality stars with shady pasts  Kelly Osbourne  Way back in 2006, Kelly Osbourne expressed interest in taking it off for Playboy but said some of her body parts "would need some airbrushing." In response, Hugh Hefner said, "I can't see it happening somehow; we don't airbrush to that extent." Jeez, Hef, grow some tact! I wonder if Hef is bummed now that Kelly is thinner, tan, and more Playboy's speed?  Bridget Marquardt  Bridget Marquardt might have been one of the "Girls Next Door," but apparently, she couldn't get in the door at Playboy. After a couple of failed test shoots, she was rejected from being a Playmate, but the Hef welcomed her into his brothel of babes. It seems like a much better deal to get the riches and fame without getting naked. So much for being the dumb one!  The Frisky: Hairstyles that must die on 12 famous men  Britney Spears  Britney Spears wasn't exactly rejected, but she was put on the cooler until she stopped acting so nutty. Playboy reps said, "Hef has said that he is more than happy to feature Britney in the magazine once she can put herself back on the road to recovery." Really? You're asking her to get her act together and then pose naked? Isn't it supposed to be the other way around?  The Frisky: 12 bizarro celebrity look-alikes  The "royal" housewife  When "Real Housewives of New York City" reality star and former model Kelly Bensimon announced she was doing Playboy, Countess LuAnn de Lesseps was all, "No one asked me!" But she has since changed her tune. She says, "I think my 15-year-old would have a heart attack if I were to do Playboy. It's not something I really want to do." It's generally a good idea to feign disinterest in things that totally aren't going to happen. I've already emailed John Mayer to tell him I won't date him. He's probably really sad."  Russian lesbian pop stars TATU  Remember that awesome Russian lesbian singing duo, TATU? They did that song "All the Things She Said" and that cover of "How Soon is Now"? Well, they were really excited to pose for Playboy when they both turned 18, but German and American editions of the magazine said they weren't interested! They did get a blurb in the music section of Playboy, but had to keep their clothes on, which, judging from their music videos, was really hard for them.  The Frisky: 10 celebrities who were bullied  "The Partridge Family" mom  Shirley Jones, who played the mom on "The Partridge Family," might be 75 years old, but that didn't stop her from posing for some sexy test shots, featuring legs and cleave. But Hefner rejected the pictures, apparently because he "expected more nudity" from the actress. I think at 75, if the biggest insult Hugh Hefner can give you is that he wants to see more of you naked, you've totally won.  TM &  2010 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved

Los Angeles The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office is reopening its investigation into the death of movie star Natalie Wood, who drowned in 1981 while boating off Catalina Island near the California coast, authorities said Thursday.  Homicide investigators are taking a new look at one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries after they were contacted by people who claimed they had "additional information" about the drowning, the sheriff's department said in a statement.  Authorities didn't provide further details late Thursday and said a news conference on the matter will be held Friday at 11 a.m. (2 p.m. ET).  Last year, the actress' sister, Lana Wood, and the captain of the yacht on which Wood sailed with her husband, actor Robert Wagner, had asked the sheriff's office to reopen the case.  On Thursday, L.A. County Sheriff's Deputy Benjamin Grubb couldn't say whether the sister and the yacht captain have prompted the renewed investigation.  "I don't know if that's related, but that's what the press conference is about tomorrow," Grubb told CNN.  Natalie Wood once said in a televised interview that her greatest fear was of dark seawater. On November 29, 1981, she drowned in the Pacific Ocean off the isthmus of Catalina Island.  Wood's body was found floating in the water about a mile away from the yacht.  According to police reports, Wood was found wearing a long nightgown, socks, and a down jacket.  The autopsy report shows Wood had two dozen bruises on her body, including a facial abrasion on her left cheek, and bruises on her arms.  "My sister was not a swimmer and did not know how to swim, and she would never go to another boat or to shore dressed in a nightgown and socks," said Lana Wood.  Although the county coroner's office ruled that Wood's death was an accident, others say the case hasn't made sense.  In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and husband on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning. She told CNN last year she does not suspect foul play.  "I just want the truth to come out, the real story," she said last year.  Dennis Davern, the former captain of the yacht Splendour broke his long silence with a detailed account in "Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour," a book he wrote with his friend Marti Rulli. It was published in September 2009.  Davern has said he believes Wood's death was a direct result of the fight with Wagner.  Lana Wood and Davern couldn't be reached immediately for comment Thursday.  Wagner's publicist Alan Nierob issued a statement saying the actor's family "fully support the efforts of the LA County Sheriff's Dept. and trust they will evaluate whether any new information relating to the death of Natalie Wood Wagner is valid, and that it comes from a credible source or sources other than those simply trying to profit from the 30 year anniversary of her tragic death."  Nierob said no one from the sheriff's department has contacted Wagner or anyone in his family about the case.  In a lengthy interview with CNN in 2010, Davern said he now believes the investigation of Wood's death was incompetent and suggested there was a cover-up. He said he regrets misleading investigators by keeping quiet at Wagner's request.  Wood and Wagner married in 1957, divorced in 1962, then remarried in 1972. They often sailed their yacht off the coast of California and they invited Wood's "Brainstorm" co-star, Christopher Walken, to join them on a sail on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981.  Walken and Wood had been filming "Brainstorm" at the time and the Hollywood rumor mill was abuzz with speculation that Wagner was jealous over Walken, but authorities have said Walken witnessed only the events leading up to an argument between the couple.  Walken couldn't be reached immediately for comment Thursday.  Wagner admitted his jealousy in his book "Pieces of My Heart," also published in September 2009. He acknowledged that there had been a fight with Wood, writing that he smashed a wine bottle on a table.  After Wagner argued with Walken and broke the wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN last year. Walken also retired to a guest room, Davern added, and Wagner followed his wife to their room. A few minutes later, Davern said, he could hear the couple fighting.  Embarrassed, Davern said he turned up the volume on his stereo. At one point, Davern recalled, he glanced out of the pilot house window and saw both Wagner and Wood on the yacht's aft deck. "They'd moved their fight outside ... you could tell from their animated gestures they were still arguing," he said.  A short time later, Wagner, appearing to be distraught, told Davern he couldn't find Wood. Davern searched the boat but couldn't find her. He noticed the rubber dinghy also was missing.  Wagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said. He suggested his wife had probably gone off in a temper.  Wagner's story, as told in his book, differs from Davern's. He maintains that after the argument with Walken, Wood went to her room and prepared for bed while he and Walken sat on the deck, cooling off.  Wagner writes that he went to check on Wood, but she wasn't there. He maintains that he and Davern searched the boat and noticed the dinghy was missing. Wagner wrote that he assumed his wife had gone ashore on her own.  He radioed the restaurant on shore where they'd had dinner and called the harbor master to see if anyone had seen Wood.  The dinghy was found about a mile away from the yacht, and a mile from where Wood's body was found.  Wood's first starring role was as a child in "Miracle on 34th Street" in 1947, and she played alongside some of Hollywood's top leading menJames Dean in "Rebel Without a Cause" and Warren Beatty in "Splendor in the Grass." She was nominated for Oscars in both of those films, as well as for "Love With the Proper Stranger" (1963), according to IMDb. One of her more memorable roles was as Maria in "West Side Story."  Wagner's striking good looks landed him roles in dozens of films in the 1950s and '60s before he hit it big in television. He starred in two popular series, "It Takes a Thief" (1968-70) and "Hart to Hart" (1979-84), and more recently as Number Two in the "Austin Powers" spy spoofs.

 Barcelona midfielder Alexander Hleb has turned down a move to Inter Milan in favor of returning to Bundesliga club Stuttgart on loan for the season.  Alexander Hleb is presented to the media after completing his loan move to former club Stuttgart.  Hleb had been expected to be part of the swap deal that saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto'o switch clubs earlier this week.  But the 28-year-old Belarus international has opted against joining Cameroon striker Eto'o at the San Siro due to the limited prospects of regular football under Jose Mourinho, and instead decided to return to Germany.  Hleb left Stuttgart four years ago to move to English Premier League side Arsenal, where he spent three seasonsincluding reaching the Champions League final in 2006, which the Gunners lost to Barcelona.  Top 20 summer transfer targets  Hleb eventually ended up moving to the Nou Camp last summer, but struggled to claim a place in the side and was omitted from the 18-man squad that beat Manchester United in this year's Champions League final.  Hleb told Stuttgart's official Web site he had moved to Markus Babbel's side because of their prospects for the coming season.  "I have opted for Stuttgart because the team has great potential and I am convinced that we can achieve a lot together," the 28-year-old said.  Stuttgart general manager Horst Heldt added: "We have signed a world class player with Alexander Hleb. He will increase the quality of our squad even further."  Stuttgart had seen moves for both Real Madrid's Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Vagner Love of CSKA Moscow break down in recent weeks.

Japan's space agency announced this week that the country would put an unmanned rover on the surface of the moon by 2018, joining an elite club of nations who have explored Earth's satellite.  The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), divulged the plan to an expert panel, including members of the cabinet and the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry on Monday.  "This is an initial step and a lot of procedures are still ahead before the plan is formally approved," a JAXA spokesperson told reporters.  If it is approved, the agency will reportedly use its Epsilon solid-fuel rocket technology to carry and deploy a SLIM probethe acronym stands for "Smart Lander for Investigating Moon"on the surface of the celestial body.  Japanese media estimates that the mission will cost in the region of 10 billion to 15 billion ($83.4 million - $125 million). JAXA spokesperson Chihito Onda confirmed to CNN that this estimate is realistic.  The mission is expected to be used to perfect soft-landing technologies, which could be utilized in future, manned expeditions to the moon, or even Mars. The lander will use face recognition software found in digital cameras, which will be repurposed to enable the craft to recognize craters on the surface, Onda said.  The move could be seen as Japan's attempt to play catchup to its Asian neighbors China and India, which have both notched significant extraterrestrial victories in recent yearsChina's Yutu lunar rover outlasted expectations and India successfully put a probe into orbit around Mars the first time of asking.  In 2008 Japan put its SELENE craftknown in Japan as Kaguya, after a Japanese moon princess from a 10th century folk taleinto orbit around the moon to gather data about its surface. The data gathered by the orbiter will also be used to calculate a suitable landing site for the rover.  JAXA has also put a probe on an asteroid, which returned to Earth in 2010.  Along with China, the United States and the former Soviet Union are the only other nations to have so far landed craft on the surface of the moon.  CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report.  
 Washington Even as he charges into his re-election battle, President Barack Obama has a festering weakness on a flank that, by all accounts, ought to be rock solid: the one held by African-American Democrats. Their support for his programs, belief in his leadership and enthusiasm for another term is softening just as he needs it most.  In the past few weeks, the president has been chastised by the Congressional Black Caucus for avoiding troubled inner-city districts, peppered with tough questions on BET, and suffered plummeting poll numbers among black voters.  That last item is critical. During the 2008 election, their turnout was massive and their support almost unanimous. Now, however, a Washington Post/ABC News poll finds that black voters with a "strongly favorable" view of Obama dropped from 86% to 58% in just five months.  "Patience is running out," says Reginald Daniel, a professor of sociology at the University of California Santa Barbara. Daniel has written extensively about race and politics. "People are disappointed because I think their expectations were way too high to begin with."  Many political analysts sum up those "expectations run amok" this way: White voters heralded the election of a black president as a sign that long-standing racial gaps were closing, and they expected Obama to play a post-racial role; a president for everyone, who just happened to be black.  Meanwhile, many African-American voters just as clearly saw his election as a great leap forward and hoped the presence of a black president in the Oval Office would bring a new level of understanding, acknowledgment, and relief for their community's problems.  "Finding a middle ground is almost an impossibility," Daniels says. "It's just the worst position to be in."  The driving problem, however, is neither black nor whiteit is green. Joblessness, bad for everyone, is much worse in African-American communities, where unemployment is pushing 17%, the worst since the 1980s. That is what triggered the revolt in the CBC and those stinging questions during that TV interview.  The president is pushing back, pointing out that his initiatives, such as health care reform and the recent jobs bill, especially help lower-income families, many of whom are black. On BET, he quickly dismissed talk about a dearth of specific programs for minorities.  "What people are saying all across the country is we are hurting and we've been hurting for a long time," the president said. "The question is: How can we make sure the economy is working for every single person?"  He also insisted that even if black leaders are grousing, it's not really about him or his policies. "There's always going to be somebody who is critical of the president of the United States." And at a CBC fundraising dinner he raised eyebrows by telling members to quit complaining and start "marching" with him for change.  But if the reaction of Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, is any gauge, he'll have to do a lot more selling. She summed up his comments in a word: "Curious."  To be sure, most African-Americans still support Obama. Political analysts do not expect a massive shift of their votes to the Republicans; and even the president's most adamant black critics often follow their barbs with a quick salve, saying African-American voters ultimately will not oppose him.  Still, the danger for the White House is not that black citizens will vote against Obama, but that they won't vote at all.  A lackluster turnout in just a few key states could tip the electoral balance against him. What's more, every moment he spends making sure black Democrats come to the polls increases his risk of alienating white voters, and is time lost winning over independents, whom he also must have.  Politically, it is hard for a candidate to tiptoe through such a black-and-white minefield. For a president, it is even tougher.

Silas Redd, who last year racked up five consecutive 100-yard games as tailback for Penn State's Nittany Lions, is leaving the troubled team to head west.  "We welcome Silas Redd to the Trojan Family," said the University of Southern California's athletic director, Pat Haden, in a statement on Tuesday. "He is an outstanding student and athlete."  The 5-foot, 10-inch, 200-pound junior from Norwalk, Connecticut, gained 1,241 rushing yards in his sophomore season, the 10th-highest total in Penn State history.  His departure could heighten a fear of attrition that was already hanging over Penn State's football program in the wake of a child sex abuse scandal and as the NCAA has limited the number of scholarships it can offer while allowing current players to transfer.  Sandusky voice mails released; abuse victim to sue  The Harrisburg Patriot News had reported that Redd was only one of a handful of players who were planning to leave.  His transfer was announced on the same day that Penn State's football team returned for a preseason workout as it heads into its first season in decades without head coach Joe Paterno, who died in January during the sex abuse scandal.  Fans, many dressed in the school's royal blue and white and holding signs of support, greeted athletes arriving for the 7 a.m. workout with chants of "For the team!" and "PSU!"  Do sanctions alter history books on legacy?  "It's a crucial time for Penn State Football," a university sports radio broadcast called "The Goon Show" posted days before on its website in its call to Tuesday's rally. "It's up to you to show the players why they should stay at PSU."  The fans, who belted out support for Bill O'Brien, Penn State's new head football coach, numbered in the hundreds, CNN affiliate broadcaster WGAL said.  Such morale boosters could prove key to the team, which saw NCAA sanctions wipe out more than a decade's worth of wins after the scandal involving former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse against 10 boys.  iReport: Penn State team returns to cheers  Vestiges of Paterno, including his bronze statute in front of Beaver Stadium, vanished amid the scandal.  The NCAA slapped the school with a four-year postseason ban and imposed a $60 million sanction after investigators blamed top university leaders, including Paterno, for showing "total and consistent disregard" for victims while a sexual predator lurked on campus.  Paterno's official record dropped from 409 wins to 298, while the NCAA also struck down six bowl wins and two conference championships.  "We're not giving up on them," said Don Smith, a longtime fan. "What happened was unfortunate, but we're going to come back. Penn State is going to come back stronger than ever."  Penn State's training camp officially kicks off on August 6. So does USC's.

 New York The man accused of attempting to set off a car bomb in Times Square considered other targets in and around New York before the failed attack, an investigator said.  Faisal Shahzad, 30, pondered attacks on Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Terminal, the World Financial Center and Connecticut helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky, going so far as to case some of the targets, a senior counterterrorism official with oversight of the investigation said Tuesday.  Dressed in a gray sweatsuit, free of handcuffs, Shahzad appeared before a federal magistrate on Tuesday afternoon to hear the charges against him. As he walked into courtroom, Shahzad gave a slight smile to his public defender, Julia Gatto. At the end of the hearing, Gatto requested that Shahzad be served halal foodprepared according to Islamic dietary lawswhile jailed.  Gatto did not object to the government's request that he remain in federal custody. He did not enter a plea, and Magistrate Judge James Francis set his next hearing for June 1.  Shahzad faces five counts in connection with the attempted bombing in Times Square on May 1. He could face life in prison if convicted.  The Pakistani-born naturalized U.S. citizen has been in federal custody since his arrest two days after the bomb attempt. During that time, he "has provided valuable intelligence from which further investigative action has been taken," the U.S. attorney's office said.  After 15 days of questioning, Shahzad invoked his right to an attorney at Tuesday's hearing, a federal law enforcement official said.  According to court documents, Shahzad has admitted to law enforcement that he attempted to detonate the bomb and that he recently received bomb-making training in the Waziristan region of Pakistan.  Attorney General Eric Holder has said Shahzad was working with the Pakistani Taliban.  E-mails obtained by CNN indicate he was looking for a way to strike back against "foreign infidel forces" he believed were oppressing the Muslim world. In one, sent to a large group of recipients in February 2006, Shahzad wrote, "Everyone knows how the Muslim country bows down to pressure from the west. Everyone knows the kind of humiliation we are faced with around the globe."  At the time, he had been in the United States for about six years, had earned his MBA and was working as a financial analyst in Connecticut.  CIA Director Leon Panetta and National Security Adviser James Jones are traveling to Pakistan to meet with officials there about the status of the Times Square investigation, a U.S. official said Tuesday. They also plan to discuss efforts to prevent future terrorist attacks in their meetings there, the official added.  The U.S. government wants to see continued Pakistani cooperation in determining what role the Pakistani Taliban may have played in assisting Shahzad. Washington also wants an aggressive push by Pakistani authorities to take action against al Qaeda-linked groups in the largely ungoverned tribal areas along its border with Afghanistan.  CNN National Correspondent Susan Candiotti and National Security Analyst Frances Townsend contributed to this report.

A man known as "Carlos the Jackal" stood trial in Paris on Monday, accused of fatal bombings in France during the 1980s.  The 62-year-old, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, was once among the world's most wanted fugitives.  He is on trial for his alleged role in the attacks on two trains, a train station and a newspaper office in France in 1982 and 1983. The bombings killed 11 and injured more than 100.  The Venezuelan-born revolutionary has been serving a life sentence in France since 1997, when he was convicted for the shooting deaths of two French secret agents and an informant in 1975.  Ramirez, who was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, first made headlines in 1975 when he led an attack on an OPEC meeting in Vienna that took at least 60 hostage, including 11 oil ministers. He was nicknamed "Carlos the Jackal" by the press, a reference to the principal character and assassin in Frederick Forsyth's novel "The Day of the Jackal."  After two decades on the run, Ramirez was captured in 1994 in Sudan and taken to Paris in a sack.  Entering court dressed casually in jeans and a navy jacket Monday, Ramirez smiled when asked to identify his profession.  "I am a professional revolutionary," he replied.  Ramirez regularly raised his fist in the air to those sitting in the back of the courtroom who had come to support him.  Francis Szpiner, lawyer for some civil parties in the case, said he was not put off by Ramirez's theatrics.  "I am concerned that 17 years later, we can see that he hasn't learned or forgotten a thing.  He has not changed a bit, so I expect a difficult trial and the victims will simply have to listen to him with patience and perseverance," Szpiner said.  Ramirez's lawyer and wife, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre told reporters outside the courtroom that her client was in a "fighting mood" and that she was ready to prove his innocence.  "Let's be concrete. Ilich Ramirez Sanchez is not implicated by any evidence," she said, adding that "a lie is being prepared for these victims who in turn will never know who was behind the attacks."  A seven-judge terrorism panel will rule after a six week trial.  
 Kabul, Afghanistan An investigation into an attack that killed eight U.S. troops in eastern Afghanistan last year said the combat outpost was an "attractive target" because protection improvements hadn't been made and intelligence assets had been diverted.  These were main points in the findings released Friday by the U.S. military into the probe of the October 3 attack on Combat Outpost Keating in the Kamdesh district of Nuristan province.  The attack killed eight U.S. service members and wounded 22 others.  Based on the recommendations in the investigation, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top coalition military commander in Afghanistan, "took appropriate action regarding Army personnel involved."  The report also praised soldiers of B Troop, 3rd Squadron, 61st Calvary for repelling the assault by a force of 300 militants.  Commanders must regularly assess "the value and vulnerabilities" of combat outposts, said the report, which "made several recommendations to improve coalition tactics."  The base had been scheduled to be closed before the attack occurred, and "needed force protection improvements (which) were not made" because of the imminent closure.  "Critical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets which had been supporting COP Keating had been diverted to assist ongoing intense combat operations in other areas," the report said. It also said "intelligence assessments had become desensitized to reports of massing enemy formations by previous reports that had proved false."  All of these factors "resulted in an attractive target for enemy fighters."  The military says militants had been planning the attack for days, hiding mortars, rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains.  The assault started around dawn as bullets and rockets peppered the remote outpost October 3 and lasted for 12 hours, pinning down the exhausted troops.  One soldier said afterward the insurgency was so fierce that the troops couldn't get to their weapons to fire back. They called in air support to help thwart the militants.  "They were under heavy enemy contact," Sgt. Jayson Souter said.  Four servicemenSouter, a fellow soldier, an Apache helicopter pilot and a gunnertalked to a military reporter about their roles during the Keating attack in an interview posted by the Department of Defense on Facebook and NATO's International Security Assistance Force YouTube Channel.  Chief Warrant Officer Ross Lewallen, an Apache pilot, said a few aircraft were damaged in what was a "time-consuming endeavor" governed by tough terrain. He said the morning battle was "significant," but later troops were able to identify targets and eliminate larger weapons.  "One of the primary reasons for the fight taking so long is that it is an extreme terrain," he said in the interview.  The report said the troops killed 150 enemy fighters and "found that the soldiers and junior leaders fought heroically in repelling an enemy force five times their size.  "Members of B Troop upheld the highest standards of warrior ethics and professionalism and distinguished themselves with conspicuous gallantry, courage, and bravery under the heavy enemy fire that surrounded them."

The search for a plane that was carrying a software company president and members of his family when it disappeared from radar over Idaho was set to resume Wednesday morning after would-be rescuers were forced to suspend their efforts because of nightfall, authorities said.  Search and rescue teams detected a weak signal from an emergency locator transmitter that allowed authorities to narrow the search to the area south of Johnson Creek, near Yellow Pine, where the plane is believed to have gone down.  "We've done a ping on the cell phones, and we've narrowed it down to a 4- or 5-square-mile area that we're searching right now," Valley County Sheriff's Office Lt. Dan Smith told CNN affiliate KGO.  Dale Smith had left Baker City, Oregon, with his son, his son's wife, his daughter and her fiance, said Rand Kriech. He and Smith founded SerialTek, a San Jose, California, company that develops hardware and software data storage tools.  Smith's wife and another daughter were in Cascade, Idaho, on Tuesday awaiting news about the search, Kriech said.  The Smiths were in Dale Smith's single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza en route to Butte, Montana. About 3 p.m. Sunday, as they were flying over central Idaho at an altitude of 9,000 feet, the 51-year-old executive reported engine trouble and asked controllers in Salt Lake City for the coordinates of the Johnson Creek Air Strip, the sheriff's spokesman said.  They never made it.  Snow hampered search efforts, carried out Monday by helicopters from the Idaho Army National Guard.  Three more planes were expected to join the search on Wednesday, according to Robert Feeley, a spokesman for the Idaho Bureau of Homeland Security.  About 40 search and rescue teams, some using ATVs and snowmobiles, combed the area Tuesday and were expected to resume their efforts at first light on Wednesday, authorities said.  Repeated attempts to fly into the area of the last known contact, about a mile east of the Johnson Creek Air Strip, were unsuccessful Monday because of poor weather, the Valley County Sheriff's Office said.  "If there is anyone who is able to survive a difficult situation, that would be Dale," San Jose Mormon Bishop Jed Dyreng told KGO of his fellow churchgoer. "When there was Hurricane Katrina, Dale was the first one to get in his plane, grab a bunch of members of his church and go out and help."  "We are a little bit worried," said the bishop's wife, Ann Dyreng, who flew with Smith to Utah in October. "He's an engineer brain, and he's very meticulous about doing all that. He's meticulous in all things he does."  Smith co-founded SerialTek in 2007, serving as president and chief technologist. It employs 25 people, said Kriech, who described Smith as a religious man who had done humanitarian work with the group Medecins sans Frontieres.  "He's an engineer's engineer," Kriech said Tuesday. "If anyone can get out of this situation, it's Dale. Hopefully, he laid the plane down safely. That's what we are hoping and praying for this morning. He's a good man, and we're hoping to see him back here."  CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.  
 One of three convicted killers who escaped from an Arizona prison was captured Sunday in Rifle, Colorado, and authorities are on the lookout for a silver Volkswagen Jetta the remaining escapees may be driving, according to corrections officials.  Daniel Renwick, 36, was spotted driving a brown Chevy Blazer by a Rifle police officer who gave chase, Arizona Department of Corrections Director Charles Ryan told CNN Radio. Gunshots were exchanged, and Renwick was ultimately taken into custody.  Renwick, who broke out of the Arizona State Prison-Kingman Friday night along with two others, was serving 22 years for second-degree murder. He is being held in Colorado, awaiting questioning by the U.S. Marshals Service.  Ryan said the remaining escapees, identified as Tracy Province and John McCluskey, are believed to be driving a 2002 silver Jetta purchased Saturday in west Phoenix.  "If anyone sees this silver, 4-door Jetta, we recommend they call 911," Ryan said.  The men, who have been described as armed and dangerous, were discovered missing after the 9:45 p.m. count Friday at the privately-operated Kingman facility. The escapees cut a hole in the fence, authorities said. A helicopter and dogs began a search.  "Precisely how they escaped is under investigation," Ryan said, noting some "operational security problems" at the prison.  "Those are being evaluated and investigated as we speak," he added.  Province and McCluskey are believed to be with a female accomplice who was on the visitation list for one of the inmates.  After their escape, the inmates and the accomplice abducted two truck drivers on Interstate 40 outside of Kingman and hijacked their 18-wheeler, according to the Mohave County Sheriff's Department in Kingman. They released them and the rig five hours later in Flagstaff, about 135 miles to the east.  Province, 42, was serving a life sentence for murder and armed robbery. McCluskey, 45, was serving 15 years for second-degree murder and other charges.  The suspected accomplice was identified as 43-year-old Casslyn Mae Welch, who is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 135 pounds with brown hair and green eyes.

The World Health Organization wants you to stop eating so much sugar. Seriously.  In draft guidelines proposed this week, WHO is encouraging people to consume less than 5% of their total daily calories from sugars. The organization's current guidelines, published in 2002, recommend eating less than 10% of your total daily calories from sugars.  Most Americans still consume much more.  Our sweet tooth increased 39% between 1950 and 2000, according to the USDA. The average American now consumes about three pounds of sugar each week.  "There is increasing concern that consumption of free sugars, particularly in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages, may result in ... an increase in total caloric intake, leading to an unhealthy diet, weight gain and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases," WHO said in a statement.  Of particular concern, WHO said, is the role sugar plays in causing dental diseases worldwide.  For an adult at a normal body mass index, or BMI, eating 5% would be around 25 grams of sugaror six teaspoons. That's less than is typically found in a single can of regular soda, which contains about 40 grams of sugar.  Real or fake sugar: Does it matter?  To find the amount of calories from sugar in a product, multiply the grams by 4. For example, a product containing 15 grams of sugar has 60 calories from sugar per serving, according to the American Heart Association. If you eat 2,000 calories a day, that's 3%.  WHO's proposed guidelines apply to sugars added to foods by manufacturers, as well as those found naturally in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit concentrates. They do not apply to those found in fresh produce.  "Much of the sugars consumed today are 'hidden' in processed foods that are not usually seen as sweets," the WHO website states.  Did you know sugar is often added to your frozen pizza? How about your bread, soup, yogurt and mayonnaise? As consumers became more concerned about the amount of fat in their food, manufacturers went out of their way to make low-fat itemsoften substituting sugar to preserve the taste.  Choosing foods with fewer added sugars at the grocery story may soon get a little easier. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed several changes to the nutrition labels you see on packaged foods and beverages.  The proposed labels would also note how much added sugar is in a product. Right now, it's hard to know what is naturally occurring sugar and what has been added by the manufacturer.  The WHO guidelines will be open for public comment until March 31. Then WHO will finalize and publish its recommendations.  
 Rescue teams continued scouring waters off Mexico's coast Thursday, searching for seven Americans on a fishing expedition missing since a boat capsized over the weekend.  None of the missing had been spotted by Thursday afternoon, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Levi Read told CNN. But he said officials believe they could have survived, helped by warm water temperatures and calm seas.  "Conditions are probably about as good as we can expect," he said.  One American was killed when the boat with more than 40 people aboard sunk early Sunday in the Sea of Cortez, near Isla San Luis, Mexico, authorities said.  Sixteen of 19 Americans that have been rescued returned to the United States Thursday, the government of Mexico's Baja California state said. Three rescued Americans remained in Mexico as the search continued, the government said.  Relatives of the seven missing Americans are seeking donations to help continue rescue efforts after Mexican and U.S. teams end the official search.  The search has been extended indefinitely, Mexican officials said Thursday. It had originally been scheduled to stop around 2 a.m. Thursday, 96 hours after the boat capsized.  The situation has drawn attention from officials in California, the home state of many of the missing. On Wednesday a group of California lawmakers urged federal officials to encourage Mexican authorities to keep searching.  "With the warm weather conditions, we believe the missing family members may be able to survive for additional days at sea or on one of the many islands in the region," the lawmakers wrote in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Robert Papp.  Family spokesman Frederick Hanwhose 52-year-old father-in-law, Donald Lee, is among the missingsaid he was holding out hope.  "If we know there are still people out there who are going to make the effort to search for them, then we maintain the hope that they're going to be found," he said Wednesday.  Han said relatives have urged U.S. authorities to play a greater role, and have been getting the word out about the situation online at findourfathers.blogspot.com. Family members also launched a Facebook page "Find Our Fathers" and a PayPal account for donations to help with the search and rescue efforts.  U.S. and Mexican teams are part of the search, as the boat was carrying citizens of both nations.  A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 Hercules aircraft searched a 300-square-mile area near Isla San Luis Thursday. The plane will search the area again Friday, the Coast Guard said.  The Coast Guard said in a statement Thursday that it had searched 1,400 square miles of ocean and land since the Mexican Navy requested assistance in the operation.  U.S. authorities identified the American tourist who died as Leslie Yee.  In addition to Lee, the missing also include Albert Mein, Russell Bautista, Mark Dorland, Brian Wong, Gene J. Leong and Shawn Chaddock.  U.S. and Mexican authorities said there were 43 people on the boat when it sank. The U.S. Coast Guard originally said 44 people were onboard, but changed their number after learning that one person listed on the manifest had never boarded the boat.  CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.

Editor's note: Rudy Ruiz founded RedBrownandBlue.com, a site featuring multicultural political commentary, hosts a nationally syndicated Spanish-language radio show; and wrote a guide to success for immigrants ("Adelante!" published by Random House). He is co-founder and president of Interlex, an advocacy marketing agency based in San Antonio, Texas.  Rudy Ruiz says people hold on to their views despite the evidence for fear of being labeled a flip-flopper.  SAN ANTONIO, Texas As people shout over each other and tune out diverging views in town hall meetings, the health care debate is proving to be symptomatic of a major ailment threatening our nation:  A contagious culture of closed-mindedness threatens to suffocate our progress as a society.  Why has it become so difficult to even consider changing our minds about important issues?  Here's my diagnosis.  Increasingly, the willingness to change one's position on political issues has been misread as a mark of weakness rather than a product of attentive listening and careful deliberation.  During the 2004 Presidential campaign, the successful branding of John Kerry as a flip-flopper doomed his bid. Fear of "flip-flopper syndrome" is apparently catching like the flu, because today politicians are not alone in their determination to adhere to partisan positions despite the changing needs of our nation.  Nearly everyone's so reluctant to appear wishy-washy that they stand firm even when the evidence is against their views.  Three factors exacerbate this paralysis by lack of analysis: labels, lifestyles and listening.  First, the labels ascribed to many potential policy tools render sensible options taboo, loading what could be rational, economic or social measures with moral baggage. This narrows our choices, hemming in policy makers.  Any proposal including the words "government-run" elicits cries of "socialism" and "communism." Any argument invoking the words "God" or "moral" sparks accusations of "right-wing extremism," "fascism," or "Bible-thumping." Instead of listening to each other's ideas, we spot the warning label and run the other way.  Second, our lifestyles favor knee-jerk reactions. The way we think, work and live in the Digital Age demands we quickly categorize information without investing time into rich interaction, research and understanding.  We're hesitant to ask questions because we don't have time to listen to the long, complicated answers that might follow. And we lack the time to fact-check competing claims. In our haste, it's easier to echo our party's position than drill down, questioning whether party leaders are motivated by our best interests or the best interests of their biggest contributors.  Third, we tend to listen only to like-minded opinions as media fragmentation encourages us to filter out varying perspectives. If you're a liberal, you avoid FOX News. If you're a conservative you revile MSNBC. The dynamic is even more pronounced online, where a niche media source can be found for any outlook.  This silences the opportunity for meaningful dialogue and deliberation that might lead to reformulating positions, forging sustainable compromises, and developing consensus crucial to moving our nation forward on complex issues.  So how can we overcome this challenge, starting with the health care debate? How do we open our minds to the possibility that we could actually learn from somebody else? Here's my prescription.  For starters, we should eschew the notion that changing our minds is a character flaw. To the contrary, experts believe it's a manifestation of higher intelligence. Renowned psychologist Stuart Sutherland wrote in "Irrationality," his seminal 1992 book: "The willingness to change one's mind in the light of new evidence is a sign of rationality not weakness."  To further free our minds, we should aggressively treat the three Ls:  Let's lose the labels: from "flip-flopper" to "commie," from "fear-monger" to "right-wing nut job." Trash the diatribe; mull the ideas.  Let's engage in some constructive lifestyle management, slowing down to ponderand make independent decisionsas enlightened people. We cannot allow the technological evolution to rob us of the intellectual strides of the American Revolution.  We must value the art of listening, reflection, comparative analysis, and civil discourse if we're to make the most of our democracy. In the process, we should signal to leaders that we're willing to expand our horizons beyond party lines. Maybe they'll get in front of our parade, collaborating for a change.  Let's request a second opinion and listen to each other. Switch channels. Visit different Web sites. Read a newspaper, while we can still find one. How about stepping into a town hall with an open mind, prepared to converse with people hailing from diverse circumstances? A range of perspectives enriches our viewpoint, empowering us to craft nuanced responses to complex situations.  Ultimately, we must stop thinking that the only thing to think is what we've thought all along. As we learn more about multifaceted matters, our positions should evolve accordingly. Let's accept that it's OK to change your minds.  In the end, opening our minds can only enhance the prognosis for our most cherished patient: America.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rudy Ruiz.  
 Ashton Carter, the former second-in-command at the Pentagon, appears to be the top choice to replace outgoing Secretary Chuck Hagel.  Barring any last minute complications, Ash Carter will be President Barack Obama's choice as the new Secretary of Defense, several U.S. administration officials told CNN.  An administration official had said that Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, a former General Counsel at the Pentagon, was also still on the list of possibilities, but on Tuesday morning, sources said Johnson was no longer being considered. The prospect of an additional confirmation hearing for Johnson's replacement if he were to move to the Pentagon as the Senate switches to Republican control would have been problematic for the White House.  Related: Was Hagel doomed from the start?  Hagel announced his resignation last week, but has said he will stay on until his successor is confirmed by the Senate.  Carter, who served as Deputy Defense Secretary under both Leon Panetta and Hagel, would bring a wide range of experience to a department confronting multiple crises in the Middle East and preparing to enter a new phase in Afghanistan as the NATO combat mission ends.  Carter's ability to hit the ground running from his past experience at the Pentagon, in addition to the respect many senior military leaders have for him are seen as major benefits to winning confirmation should Obama nominate him.  "His career has sort of prepared him perfectly for this kind of a moment," says Michael O'Hanlon, a defense industry analyst at the Brookings Institution.  In addition to a broad understanding of the Pentagon bureaucracy, Carter is seen as a master of managing large budgets, a premium in the present era of continued belt tightening on Capitol Hill, as well as an expert on weapons acquisitions.  Related: White House struggles to find Hagel successor  He also has a firm grasp on understanding the trends and technology of warfare in the future.  "On paper and in terms of his resume and preparation you probably couldn't do much better," O'Hanlon said.  But Carter does lack certain experience shared by Hagel, Panetta had and many other secretaries - first--hand military experience. Carter has extensive experience at the Pentagon and in academia, but he was never actually in the military.  "You can always find things that you would have loved in a hundred year life span to have seen everyone do before they take this job, but realistically he has accomplished about as much as you could ask," O'Hanlon said.  Whoever is ultimately selected may not have much opportunity to make a mark at the Pentagon. They'll likely have less than two years likely on the job after confirmation. The next defense secretary will confront the specter of another possible round of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration to navigate with Congress, along with a White House known by some for micromanaging foreign and defense policy.  While Carter was always seen likely on Obama's short-list of candidates, his name gained prominence following the withdrawals from consideration by former Pentagon official Michele Flournoy and Sen. Jack Reed that they not be considered for the post.  Carter, who does not have a background as a political operative, is believed to be open to returning to the Pentagon, and would likely generate a smooth confirmation process officials tell CNN.  He was previously a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School, and was recently listed as a senior executive at the Markle Foundation.

As Android devices get more popular (today comScore reports Android phones comprise 40% of the U.S. smartphone market), they're becoming a more attractive target for cybercriminals. If you use an Android smartphone, you are now 2.5 times more likely to encounter malware (malicious software) than you were six months ago.  This isn't just about apps. This year, 30% of Android users are likely to encounter a Web-based threat such as phishing scams, "drive by downloads" and browser exploits.  This is according to a new threat report from Lookout Mobile Security. Obviously, Lookout is selling mobile-security tools. However, individual and collective mobile security risks are real.  Whether you opt to pay for mobile security, use a free service or manage it yourself, you should be aware of the risks and use basic mobile safety skills.  Cybercriminals aren't simply targeting Android devices more often, they're also getting sneakier about it.  Specifically, Lookout notes that attackers are using new techniques to distribute malware to phones. These include "malvertising" (ads served up through legitimate apps that lead you to a fake Android market and trick you into downloading malware, like GGtracker) and "upgrade attacks" (where the initially downloaded app is clean, but later upgrades deploy malware).  How can mobile malware harm you? First of all, cybercriminals can rack up charges to your phone bill through "carrier billing," a payment option that wireless carriers are increasingly pushingand which Google is starting to make possible for Android market app purchases. Malware also can sign you up for "premium SMS" text messaging services.  Furthermore, mobile malware and spyware can pull sensitive data from your phonesuch as your credit card numbers, online banking or e-mail account login credentials or your contacts list.  Infected phones also can become part of a "botnet," which means your phone could be used without your knowledge as part of a larger attack scheme. This can also drive up your data traffic, which can push you toward your data plan's cap faster.  Why is Android a bigger mobile security concern? It's an open platform, which presents significant pros and cons.  On the bright side, Android's openness has made it easier for vendors to offer cheaper smartphones (especially without costly two-year contracts) to a much broader consumer market. On the downside, Android's openness also makes it especially susceptible to malware.  Users of Apple and BlackBerry mobile devices are not immune to mobile security threats. But the closed nature of those platforms does make it harder for cybercriminals to infiltrate those devices with malware.  However, threats such as e-mail phishing attempts and PDF exploits can put any mobile user at riskeven on the iPhone. (Apple recently patched its latest PDF vulnerability, but future iOS risks are always a possibility.)  Learn more about mobile security risks  John Hering, co-founder and CEO of Lookout, explains that a credulous user mindset has been a key factor in mobile security risks.  "We've observed that most mobile users are far more trusting about how they download and install software on their phone, compared to their computer," he said. "But fortunately that's starting to change. Android users especially are starting to get more discerning."  However, the way people tend to use smartphones can also put them at risk. Hering noted that mobile users tend to be in distracting environments, so they generally provide only short bursts of divided attention to their phones.  Kevin Mahaffey, Lookout's CTO and co-founder, explained that spotting malware on mobile devices is a bigger technical challenge than on computers.  "Personal computers have lots of powerboth energy and processing capacityso it's easy to run security analyses in that environment. If it were even possible to run the same types of analytics on a mobile phone, that would destroy battery and take two decades to build," Mahaffey said.  "So we had to consider, what if we could change the way malware detection is done? Instead of doing it on individual devices operating out in the world, what if we put it all on a big server and treat it as a data mining problem?"  This concept formed the genesis of Lookout's Mobile Threat Network, which provides mobile device security through an online platform that aggregates and constantly scans anonymized data gathered from over 700,000 mobile apps.  One advantage of this approach is speed. Also, users don't have to remember to update Lookout security software; the system constantly updates itself.  Mahaffey notes that if your phone is running an older version of the Android operating system, you face greater mobile security risks.  On Android phones, OS updates get deployed via a variety of manufacturers and wireless carriers. Because of this complexity, on many phones system updates lag behindsometimes far behindthe latest "flavor" of Android (currently 2.3 "Gingerbread" for phones).  Unless you've rooted your Android phone to gain complete control over it, it's up to the carrier and manufacturer, not you, when your phone will get a system update.  In contrast, iPhone system updates get deployed by a single source: Apple. So at any given time most iPhones in use probably have a fairly up-to-date version of iOS (unless it's a much older device, such as the iPhone 3G).  Complicating this picture, to keep costs down some Android phone manufacturers skimp on processing power and other device capabilities. So some cheaper phones simply are not able to run the latest version of Android well, or at all.  This is why some brand new but cheaper models come with vastly outdated flavors of Androidlike the Huawei Ascend, currently sold by MetroPCS for $99 on a $50/month no-contract plan, which comes with Android 2.1 ("Eclair," released back in January 2010).  What red flags should mobile users watch for? According to Hering and Mahaffey, strange text messages coming from unknown sources are a common clue that you may have been subscribed unwittingly to a premium SMS service. You should contact your carrier immediately to report these.  Also, check your phone bill online periodicallyprobably more often than once a month.  Malware can cause a lot of surreptitious activity on your phone, so battery performance might be a clue. "If your battery suddenly starts draining really fast, consider that it might be malware," Mahaffey said.  Hering also recommends healthy skepticism.  "Scrutinize permissions for Android apps before you download them. Does that game or utility really need permission to send premium SMS messages? Probably not," he said.  The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.  
 The voice is what you end up missing the most.  If you've ever had a friend who has meant the world to you, and the friend has died, you'll find yourself half hoping to hear the voice even years after the friend has gone. I have a feeling that there are more than a few of you reading these words today who know exactly what I mean.  So it can hit you like a small miracle when, against all odds, the voice of your friend returns.  Jack Roth was my best friend from the time we were 5 years old. He died in 2004 at the age of 57; a man who was not a smoker, he nonetheless was cut down by lung cancer.  For all those years, from the time we were boys, we never stopped talking to each other, about big things and small. There is not a week that goes by when I don't want to talk with him again.  On the cusp of every new summer for the last five years, Jack's wife, his daughter and we who were his friends have held a charity race in his memory through the streets of the central Ohio town where we grew up: the streets he loved. We did it again this year, on a warm and gorgeous Sunday.  But there was an additional kind of warmth this year because, in a pair of ways none of us could have predicted, Jack's voice was there with us again.  A fellow named Gary Bender discovered an audiotape. When we were all 12 years old, Gary, it seemed, was a member of the audio/visual club at our junior high school. He ran the public address system at assemblies.  It turns out that he recorded reel-to-reel tapes during the presentations. Now living in California, he was going through some old boxes recently and found a tape on which boys and girls were being nominated for class offices.  Jack had not been nominated. But he placed into nomination for president a boy named Gary Herwald. And now, almost six years after Jack's death, here was Jack's voice in a way I barely remembered it. Nervous, proud, high-pitched, the voice of a 12-year-old standing on a wooden stage:  "Mr. Stolzenberg, members of the faculty, and the student body ... As you know, I represent Gary Allen Herwald ... Gary has fine leadership abilities ... Gary is kind to all people he encounters, whether it is on the playground, classroom, or athletic field. ..."  The last time I heard Jack's voice, he was dying. The voice was so weak, struggling for air, filled with sadness that he was leaving his wife and daughter behind. So to hear the voice of Jack when life was new, for him and for all of us ... well, I listened to that tape over and over again. My oldest friend, rediscovered.  And then I found another version of his voice. Unbeknownst to me, Jack, even in his final months, was writing letters of gratitude to those who had treated him thoughtfully. One of the people to whom he wrote was a man named Gary Zimmerman (I knowa lot of Garys in this tale), who lives in New York.  I had never met Gary Zimmerman, but he sent me a copy of the letter Jack had written to him on October 16, 2004, barely two months before he died. It was pure Jack, full of care:  "Oh, Gary. That's so kind of you. I just can't tell you what it means to my family and me to know of your feelings for us. Although my life continues to become more difficult and it's harder to see a future that resembles anything like normalcy, I pray that someday we will once again find peace and good health. God bless you for your prayers. ..."  Thus it was with those newly found voices in my earthe spoken voice of Jack at 12, trying so hard to do a good job at the nominating assembly, the written voice of Jack at 57, using some of his dwindling energy to send his thanks to a man who had been nice to his family and himthat I arrived in Ohio for this year's race in his honor.  Gary Herwaldthat same Gary Herwald who, half a century ago, Jack had nominated for class presidenthad come to town, too, to run in Jack's race. He picked me up and we rode over to the starting line together.  When Jack and I were young, there were five of us who were best friends. We called ourselves ABCDJAllen, Bob, Chuck, Dan, Jack. In the town where we lived, there is a community plaza upon which residents and former residents are invited to purchase bricks with their names carved into the surface.  Before Jack died, he purchased a brick. But he didn't have his name carved into it. Instead he had those five initials inscribed: ABCDJ. He told me he did it just so there was "something to show that we were once here."  On race day, I walked to where the brick is. I think I can just about find it with my eyes closed.  I looked down at it, and for a moment I did in fact close my eyes and heard again his voice when he was young, his voice when he was dying.  If you are lucky, and I know that some of you are, you can do the same thing as you think about your own best friends who now are gone. In the ways that matter, their voices are always present; they have a way of finding you just when you need them the most. Like friendship itself, the voices never die.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.

Severe storms hammered North Carolina on Sunday evening, but no fatalities had been reported as of Monday morning, and injuries were minor, officials said.  Residents reported as many as eight tornadoes touching downoverturning mobile homes, ripping out trees and plunging neighborhoods into darkness.  Survey crews were meeting with local officials throughout the state to get a clearer picture of the storm damage, said Ernie Seneca, spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Crime Control and Public Safety.  There were reports of damaged houses and downed trees, but injuries were limited, he said.  "It looks like people heeded the warning to seek shelter when the storm came," he said.  "It really did sound like a train. It was pure noise," said William Schlaeppi, who lives on a farm in High Point, North Carolina, where the National Weather Service reported damage to at least 20 homes. "I literally watched my fields disappear in front of me under a wall of watercircular, spinning water."  A broad band of severe thunderstorms Sunday brought heavy rain and hail, and prompted tornado warnings from Florida to Virginia, the weather service said.  A tornado touched down in Oakland Park, Florida, just north of Fort Lauderdale, between 8 and 8:30 a.m. Monday, said Tyrone Mosley, a weather service specialist. There was debris but no immediate report of injuries, he said.  In North Carolina, at least eight unconfirmed tornadoes were spotted along the Interstate 85 corridor between Charlotte and Greensboro on Sunday evening.  Metal roofing was ripped off an industrial building in Belmont, west of Charlotte, littering nearby trees with clumps of yellow insulation.  News14: Spencer residents survey damage after storm  Multiple mobile homes were overturned in Linwood, outside of Lexington, and at least three people were reported injured.  And what looked like a huge funnel cloud loomed over High Point, near Greensboro.  "It's been a very active evening for most of central North Carolina," said Julia Jarema, spokeswoman for the state's Division of Emergency Management.  The storms caused power outages throughout the state, but because of the multiple bands of storms, "things are changing so rapidly, we haven't been able to confirm numbers," Jarema said Sunday night.  Is severe weather happening near you? Send photos, video  Local law enforcement reported another tornado north of Greensboro, the weather service said.  The storm also produced 70-mph winds and hail as large as baseballs.  Late Sunday, High Point emergency management officials were going house to house to check for injuries.  Schlaeppi said he spent much of the night in his darkened house, going out with his neighbors to clear downed trees whenever the rain let up.  CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras contributed to this report.  
 Washington Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in an interview released Wednesday that he was "a bit arrogant" when he launched his ultimately failed bid for president in 2011, but that after spending nearly two years "in preparation" for another, he feels "substantially more prepared to run."  Perry told The Washington Post that he may have drawn undue confidence because of his experience as governor of an expansive and economically influential state.  During a sit-down at the Republican Governors' Association meeting in Florida, he said that experience made him feel he could "step into that role of candidate and stand up in front of the American people."  "I was mistaken," Perry admitted.  The Republican governor entered the 2012 presidential race to high expectations and great fanfare in late 2011, quickly rising to the top of the polls before plummeting to the bottom after a series of gaffes and missteps derailed his bid.  Perhaps the most infamoushis declaration of "oops" when he forgot the final federal agency he'd nix if he became presidentcontinues to dog him as he contemplates another bid. Perry acknowledged the fact that his 2012 failures will shadow his political future, but he said he believes Americans would give him another chance if he decides to run again.  "It's never going to go away," he said of his failed bid. "It's always there, just as Bill Clinton's 1988 [long-winded Democratic] convention speech is always there. It's always part of your past. I'm a big believer that Americans ... are interested in how do you perform after you've been knocked down."  But he was satisfied with how his 14-year tenure as governor of Texas had turned out, as Texas continues to boast a strong economy, he said. Perry also expressed pride in Texas' transformation from "an intellectual and cultural backwater to a place that is very much on everyone's radar screen on where would be a good place for us to either relocate or expand."  The governor said that experience would be part of his main pitch as he runs again, something he said Americans won't find in "another relatively young, inexperienced United States senator or a congressman for that matter."  Perry, if he does run, will likely face a wide array of challengers for the GOP nomination, many of them members of the U.S. House or Senate.  And he said he'd perform much better in a second presidential campaign after spending "the last 22 months in preparation."  "I'm comfortable I'm substantially more prepared to run for the presidency," he said. "I know the challenges. And so, again, I'm not ready to pull the trigger and say I'm in, but I'm comfortable that the process I've put in place here is a proper, timely and thoughtful process."  "The decision [about running] may be no, but it will not be a no because I'm not prepared," he added.  Those preparations have included multiple trips abroad and chats with policy experts, including former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. And he's become a more outspoken critic of President Barack Obama on immigration in recent months, framing his own experience governing a border state as a competent alternative to Obama's handling of the nation's immigration problems.  On Wednesday, he told the Post that the President's expected executive order delaying deportations of thousands of illegal immigrants is "unconstitutional" and "unlawful."  "It is bad public policy, and the American people are not for it," Perry added, calling on Congress to send various immigration reform measures to Obama's desk to put him on record explaining his opposition to any such reforms.  But he framed himself as a pragmatist against the more conservative voices in the GOP calling for the President's impeachment over the executive order.  "No," he said, asked about whether impeachment should be on the table for the GOP in the party's response. "I think the American people want to see government work. ... I don't think the vast majority of people see impeachment as government working. That is a last ditch effort to stick a finger in the eye of the President."

COPENHAGEN, Denamrk Actress Connie Nielsen hit the big time when she starred in "Gladiator" as Lucilla, sister of the deranged Emperor Commodus. Since then she has appeared in hit movies including "One Hour Photo" and "The Hunted".  Connie Nielsen has always refused to play the Hollywood fame game.  But Nielsen has refused to play the Hollywood fame game and seems drawn to challenging roles in controversial movies, including "The Situation", about the current Iraq war, and "Battle in Seattle", about the anti-globalization riots that took place in Seattle in 1999.  Nielsen now lives in the US and returns to Copenhagen every year. She talks to My City, My Life about what makes the city, and its people, so special.  CNN: How do you define yourself?  Connie Nielsen: I absolutely refuse the fame part of my business. I refuse even the money side of my business. I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth. That's what I want from my art, that's what I aspire to.  I try to combine my work with my family, that's what I aspire to. I don't say that's the only thing. It's not all work and family, because otherwise you would be saying no to the many other things in life and there are many other things.  CNN: The people here are supposed to be incredibly happywhat do you think?  Connie Nielsen: I think it's funny in a way because when I grew up here it was very unusual to hear the word "happiness". If you asked somebody, "what do you wish for in life?" they wouldn't say "happiness."  I would have answered "excitement, knowledge," God knowsI mean, many, many different things, but certainly not "happiness". It seemed like a foreign concept to wish for something that specific and that singular. And I think that a lot of Danes kind of feel like that about being the happiest people in the world.  CNN: Is there anything you'd like to change about the city?  Connie Nielsen: Anywhere there are social buildings that stuff people into boxes, concentrate poor people there. It's specific to any big city. There was an effort to create buildings that concentrate these people very closely, and their social problems. They are still around in New York, Paris, London and here too.  So if I could change anything about Copenhagen, or any other major big city, I would change the way we build buildings or housing for lower income people. I don't think people who are already burdened with social, economic, psychological situations, dysfunctional families, need to be burdened with other people with the same problems.  CNN: Is the city politically driven?  Connie Nielsen: I don't think I can remember a moment in my life where people didn't discuss politics. People discuss politics at the table. I think some of the first information I received was politically charged (laughs). It was at a time when girls were being told, "Why don't you go and learn how to repair machines rather than learn to repair your jumper? Why don't you learn to cut wood rather than learn to keep a house clean?" in school.  It was to make us conscious of what we were, how we defined ourselves and why you would accept one concept of yourself rather than another. Have you searched through the truth of that concept? Have you deconstructed? Have you made sure that its foundations are valid? That's how I grew up and I think it was wonderful.  CNN: How would you describe the city architecturally?  Connie Nielsen: It's everything here from very late renaissance to this 19th century golden age we had here. It's that, intermixed with pure Danish modernism. I love the juxtaposition of it all. I love when we bring in metaphors for our past as well.  CNN: A lot of the places you have taken us to have been very romantic, do you think there is a fairy tale quality to Copenhagen?  Connie Nielsen: An alternative society ... yes I do, I do feel that. I do feel that most things are possible here. I can dream here. I can imagine.  CNN: What is it about the city that makes people creative?  Connie Nielsen: Well, we have a very, very long winter and it gets a little boring, so you better think of something to do! It can get deathly boring, so you start using your imagination. Sometimes it's necessity that produces it, because you need to do something.  CNN: Is there something about the people here that want to change things for the better?  Connie Nielsen: I think soI think we're an idealistic people. I think there are disillusioned people everywhere, there are doubters everywhere, but I do think there are constructive people here; I do think that people believe in people.  CNN: Do you take any inspiration from the city?  Connie Nielsen: Yes, yes I do. Whenever I come back here I remember that I want to write poetry (laughs). I want to take more time to sit and paint some more. I want to do so many more things whenever I come backI'm always reminded of that when I come here.  CNN: You've lived in lots of cities all over the world and still do. Why is Copenhagen special to you?  Connie Nielsen: I was born here and it's the capital of my home country. It's also immensely beautiful. Many of my friends live here and much of my partner's family lives here too and so we bring our kids back here every year.  It holds all the museums that hold our history, our culture, and I take our children there and I go there for my own pleasure all the time. I love going to museums.  I love this city and I love cities that are on the water. I love the water element, specifically the sea. I grew up on the sea and I grew up sailingI love sailingand the presence of the sea gives the air and the light a very special quality that I absolutely adore.  CNN: It seems that for a small place it has a lot of cultural influence.  Connie Nielsen: Yes, it's sort of a little pearl in the middle of the seas. There's a lot of traffic through this place, from the east, west, north and south. And we are the southern part of the north, so everything from the south comes up here on its way towards the north, and the opposite. And it has left its mark.  We are definitely some kind of place where culture is being deposited over and over and over again, but it also springs from here. It's the kind of place that attracts creative people and so it springs from here too.  CNN: If Copenhagen was a person, how would you describe it?  Connie Nielsen: If Copenhagen were a person, that person would be generous, beautiful, elderly, but with a flair. A human being that has certain propensities for quarrelling, filled with imagination and with appetite for the new and with respect for the oldsomebody who takes good care of things and of people.  
 WASHINGTON House and Senate Democrats reached agreement late Monday on a budget resolution for 2010, which includes key spending priorities for the young Obama administration.  The Senate and House could vote on the budget resolution Tuesday. President Obama's budget request is $3.67 trillion.  "This budget is a major accomplishment," Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad said in a statement. "We are meeting President Obama's goals of reducing our dependence on foreign energy, striving for excellence in education, reforming our health care system, and providing middle-class tax relief."  The agreement came as lawmakers were reconciling the House and Senate versions of the budget package. The president's budget request is $3.67 trillion.  The full Senate and House are each expected to vote on the fiscal 2010 budget resolution this week. The House vote could come as soon as Tuesday.  Budget negotiators have fast-tracked part of the budget process. Major health reform is likely to pass this year, because the special processknown as budget reconciliationwon't allow Republicans to filibuster the legislation, as was widely expected.  Democrats, who currently control 58 seats in the Senate, will be able to pass it with a simple majority vote, instead of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster.  Separately, conservative Democrats in the House, who have been pushing for a strong statement from leadership on fiscal responsibility in the budget, may have some of their concerns addressed.  A Democratic aide told CNN that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer are drafting a letter to Senate leaders "throwing down the gauntlet" to insist that a pay-as-you-go system be followed, which would require new federal spending to be offset with budget cuts or tax increases.  President Barack Obama called for the so-called "PAYGO" legislation in his weekend radio address.  The budget resolution would limit increases in non-defense discretionary spending to 2.9 percent through 2014, according to Conrad.  "While the budget resolution takes important steps in the near-term of cutting the deficit in half by 2012 and by two-thirds by 2014, it is clear that more will be needed to address the long-term fiscal imbalance confronting the nation beyond the five-year budget window," said Conrad.  President Obama gathered his Cabinet members last week and challenged them to cut a total of $100 million in the next 90 days.  In the context of the federal budget, $100 million in savings is a tiny amount, critics said. It is the equivalent, according to one example, of having a car dealer offer to shave $1 from the cost of a $36,700 vehicle.  "Any amount of savings is obviously welcome," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said at the time. "But ($100 million is) about the average amount we'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year."  White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said ordinary Americans would nevertheless appreciate the savings effort.  "Only in Washington, D.C., is $100 million dollars not a lot of money. It is where I'm from. It is where I grew up. And I think it is for hundreds of millions of Americans."  CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.

Victoria Bol sits under the blazing sun in the soon-to-be world's newest capital of Juba, a city of red soil, winding dirt roads and scattered tin-roofed homes.  She watches in delight as children frolic on the streets and women mill about with the new flag of South Sudan wrapped around their shoulders.  A few feet away, boisterous neighbors spray the rare paved road with a hose, playing with the soapy suds as they hum the new anthem of a nation on the eve of its birth.  "Oh my goodness, I cannot believe this day is finally here," says Bol, a resident of Grand Rapids, Michigan. "It is very emotional. I'm excited, but I'm also thinking of all the people who died for this to happen."  Bol is among scores who have returned home to witness the birth of South Sudan, as it officially splits from the government based in the north on Saturday.  "The airport is packed and homes are filled with people coming in from all over the world," Bol says. "We lost almost everythingour relatives, our homes, everything we ownto get to this point. There was no way I was missing this."  Bol says dozens of her relatives died in the violence.  She fled Juba in 1991 as mortars rained from the sky, and has not set foot in her homeland since then.  "We were at the airport trying to leave when the north started bombing nearby," she says. "Everything shook. We all started screaming and hiding."  Sudan's Muslim north has been in conflict with the majority Christian south for decades. The civil war created a class of refugees who drifted in and out of neighboring countriesmany on footto flee violence and famine that left about 2 million people dead.  In January, South Sudan voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum to split, which was part of a 2005 peace deal that helped end the war.  Dallas resident Abuk Makuac escaped Juba in 1984.  "I wish my many relatives who died in the civil war were here to witness the separation into a new country," she says. "From here on, I know that they did not die in vain."  Scores who fled the long conflict are coming home to a region that has not changed much over the years. The infrastructure is still lackingwith about 30 miles of paved roads in all of South Sudan, an area the size of Texas.  "It is no Michigan," Bol says with a chuckle, "but it's home, and there is a feeling of solace you get at home that you will never get anywhere else."  Water remains a luxury in most communities and security is still tense, especially in regions bordering the north where violence still rages days before independence.  But patriotism trumps the challenges, say the returnees, who gathered this week in Juba to discuss how they will help move their new country forward.  Gordon Ajak, who left Sudan in 1989, hopes to capitalize on the opportunities in his homeland after he decides what to invest in.  The 46-year-old bought a one-way ticket from Canada, where he works as a counselor.  "I left Sudan because ... we were not wanted by the government in the north," he says. "We have our own country now. It is time to come back to invest and help my people."  Business analysts warn that the minimal infrastructure in South Sudan can lead to a difficult business climate.  "Good business skills will come at a premium and there will be a ferocious demand for talent," says Robert Taiwo, director of Whitespace Advisory, a global firm that works with businesses looking to invest in Africa.  The rewards, he says, can include unprecedented business opportunities.  "Returning South Sudanese will get an opportunity to shape domestic business ethics and this will ultimately govern the commercial context in which everyone operates," he says.  Ajak says he is not deterred by the flashes of violence that have flared in South Kordofan, a border area between the northern and southern regions that remains tense ahead of the independence.  Other challenges such as the disputed region of Abyei remain, he says, but he is ready to sacrifice for his new homeland.  "Back before I left, I was being attacked in a country that did not want me," he says. "The difference now is I'll be fighting for South Sudan. My own country. I'd rather die for my country than watch them suffer."  James Aguek will not make it home for the festivities, but the Orlando resident is planning to move back permanently. He has already torn his Sudan passport in anticipation of a new one from South Sudan.  "Having a new country gives me a reason to go back," the musician says. "There is no way I would have gone back to that country if we had not voted for the separation."  For now, Aguek will focus on his upcoming albumone that includes a song called "99%."  It's a reference to the number that voted for the split.  
 Is the dome doomed?  Voters may have given the Astrodome, Houston's iconic and once cutting-edge stadium, the kiss of death.  It's too early to write an obituary for the structure once deemed the "Eighth Wonder of the World," but the defeat of the bond initiative Tuesday night stacks the odds against the dome.  Voters in Harris County were given a voice on whether to issue $217 million in bonds to transform the deteriorating structure into a mammoth exhibition and event space.  The county owns the Astrodome, and its commissioners had warned that if the measure did not pass, the only course left would be to demolish it.  The proposition was rejected by a 53%-47% vote.  Harris County Judge Ed Emmett "said that with voters rejecting the only viable public option and no viable private option on the table, there's little choice but to demolish the dome," the judge's spokesman, Joe Stinebaker, said.  However, nothing can happen until the county commission meets and votes to go ahead with the demolition. The item has not been added to the commission's agenda, but it could happen as early as next Tuesday.  A majority of the commissioners had said that if the proposition failed, that they would favor demolition.  6 imperiled and extinct sports sites  Nostalgia not lacking  Whether they voted for or against the measure to save the Astrodome, Houstonians share a nostalgia for the stadium.  Completed in 1965, it was the first domed stadium in the world and was deemed a remarkable feat of engineering. The dome was the primary home of the Houston Astros and the Houston Oilers, in addition to hosting rodeos, concerts and other events.  Stephen Chmaitelli, 38, remembers being dropped off at the Astrodome with his friends as children and catching a ball game before walking to the nearby (and now defunct) Astroworld theme park.  "It was a fun way to spend your days during the summer," he said. "There are just so many memories there."  Chmaitelli voted in favor of saving the dome based on the renderings he saw of the kind of space the new dome would be. The space would make it bigger than the city's convention center, and the redesign would retain the feel of the old stadium while modernizing it.  Remodeling made economic sense, he said: The county could not buy land in such a prime location and erect a structure of such ambition for such a good price.  The Astrodome was always a symbol of pride for the city, said Bowen Shepard, a 32-year-old Houston native. But he voted against the resolution because the structure had already begun to fall into disrepair years ago.  The dome looked outdated sitting next to the more modern Reliant Stadium, and fixing it up just didn't seem worth the cost, he said.  "Everything has its time, and everything's time comes to an end," he said.  Endangered building  Months before the vote, before it was even announced that a vote would be held, the National Trust for Historic Preservation included the Astrodome on its yearly list of "11 Most Endangered Historical Places."  On the same day that the Harris County revitalization proposal was floated, the trust named the dome one of 35 "national treasures" in the country.  The designation meant that the trust put its resources to work in an attempt to save the Astrodome.  "We're disappointed this morning," Beth Wiedower, a senior field officer for the trust, said the day after the vote.  "I think (the outcome) was less of a comment on the value of the building, the heritage associated with it and more the confusion that surrounded the Astrodome these last years," she said.  For the past five years, the Astrodome has been essentially vacant. The electricity and water are still on, but it is unoccupied and used mostly for storage.  It costs the county an estimated $2 million to $3 million to maintain it, the county said.  Several ideas from the private sector have appeared over the years, but nothing with funding. As ideas have come and gone, Wiedower believes that many voters misunderstood that Tuesday's vote may have been a definitive move on the building's fate.  Now that the votes have been cast and the Astrodome is in serious jeopardy, Wiedower predicted there will be a great number of Houstonians who will regret the loss of the stadium.  If the city indeed has a change of heart at this point, the only way out might be for a "white knight" from the private sector to swoop in with a plan, said Stinebaker, the county judge's spokesman.

A Chilean girl's plea via social media for an assisted suicide caught the attention of the person the teen thinks could make it happen: President Michelle Bachelet.  Bachelet visited 14-year-old Valentina Maureira on Saturday after the girl's video went viral and spurred debate in Chile about euthanasia.  Valentina was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was 6. Her older brother died from the same disease.  Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that damages the lungs and digestive system. Valentina's family has already witnessed how the disease can be terminal.  Valentina's suffering includes vomiting and headaches that are constant, according to her father, Freddy Maureira.  The teen recently posted a video on her Facebook page, asking Bachelet to allow her to end her life.  "I am tired of living with this sickness," Valentina says in the video. "Please authorize an injection so I can sleep forever."  Bachelet visited Valentina on Saturday for more than an hour at the hospital. The country's minister of health also attended.  During the visit, the President learned details about Valentina's health, whose condition has reportedly slightly improved, CNN Chile reported. The teen thanked Bachelet for the visit, and her father said he is holding on to hope for a lung transplant for his daughter, according to CNN Chile.  Before the visit, the President had already stated her position on the impossibility of an assisted suicide for the girl.  Not even the President can agree to Valentina's request because Chilean law does not allow euthanasia, Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizaldo said.  "But what are we doing?" Elizaldo said last week. "The health ministry is in constant contact with Valentina's family, and we will provide all the emotional and psychological support and medical treatment to improve her living conditions."  Valentina's case has caused an overwhelming response on social media.  People took to Facebook and Twitter to discuss the debate on assisted suicide.  One Twitter user posed the question in a tweet: "After the case of Valentina Maureira, should euthanasia be legal?"  Doctor Andres Castillo, chief of pediatrics at Catholic University's Clinic Hospital, said that at the moment, Valentina's condition is stable."  After her diagnosis, doctors expected her to live to about 17, which would give her three and a half more years to live.  
 We may finally be able to put this whole "twerking" thing to rest.  Though it's been around for years, it wasn't firmly a part of the Zeitgeist until Miley Cyrus unleashed it upon the world. So we can probably thank Cyrus for a video of 68-year-old Helen Mirren twerking.  Yes, you read that right.  Dame Helen Mirren, Oscar winner, star of stage and screen and one of the most venerable actresses of our time, apparently doesn't mind dropping it like it's hot.  On Thursday, Mirren was honored at Harvard University with the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year award. The Hasty Pudding group is the oldest undergraduate drama troupe in the U.S. Every year, it salutesand mocksperformers who have made a lasting and impressive contribution to the entertainment industry.  During the ceremonies to honor her, Mirren was presented with the task of twerking, and so she did. She later admitted that it was not her first twerk.  "I've tried in my bedroom in private in front of the mirror, very unsuccessfully," she said. "Absolutely humiliating to have to do it in public in front of a whole load of people."  Twerk on, Helen Mirren. Twerk on.

During her darkest hours in captivity, former Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt considered death preferable to her ordeal, she said in an interview with CNN's "Connect the World."  Betancourt, who was kidnapped in 2002 during her campaign for the presidency and rescued in 2008, wrote about her experience in a new book, "Even Silence Has an End."  She recalled that late in her captivity at the hands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, she became very ill. FARC declined to give her medication, and had her lie in a hammock for months, she said. Betancourt had seen other hostages die in similar circumstances in the jungle.  "And because I was in so much in pain in my body and I was kind of unplugging mentally, in the sense that I couldn't just concentrate on anything, I thought that perhaps it was a good moment to just, you know," Betancourt said, referring to dying.  In that moment, she said, she preferred death because it would reunite her with her father.  "And, also, I thought that it could be a liberation thing for my children, because they had to stop their lives," Betancourt said.  That feeling was just one episode in her 6 1/2 years in captivity.  Writing the book, she said, brought her to "very deep memories, to places I thought I had forgotten and to situations that were very painful."  The writing process would leave her physically exhausted at the end of the day.  Betancourt was freed in a high-profile helicopter rescue mission in July 2008. Colombian commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to free the group, which included three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members.  Her book is not the first to touch on her time as a hostage.  In a memoir published last year, the U.S. military contractors rescued along with Betancourt painted an unflattering portrait of the dual citizen of France and Colombia, describing her as someone who hoarded belongings and let her temper flare during their time in the rebel camp.  For her part, Betancourt admits that she was not the most popular.  "We hear the news and they talk about the hostages and the only name that comes up on and on and on is mine," she said. "By not having their names, it was just another humiliation. It was just another torture for them, not knowing if people knew they were there, what was happening with their families."  The guerrillas who held them were also keen on keeping the hostages divided. This, she suspects, was so that they would not unite and attempt an escape together.  Much of the guerrillas' treatment of their hostages was meant to be cruel and designed to strip away their identities, Betancourt said.  "So, for me, it was important to preserve my dignity in the sense of preserving my soul, preserving the things that I thought were important for me to give. And that was a struggle," she said.  One way she did this was by showing defiance.  When her captors ordered the hostages to identify themselves by numbers, she refused.  Although her fellow hostages started counting off, when it came to be her turn, she just answered, "Ingrid Betancourt."  "I didn't want to be a number. I didn't want to be an object," she said. "They were referring to us like cargo. And I thought that was horrible. And I didn't want them to get away with that. So I think I was a little like a troublemaker, in some aspects."  That streak also partly led to divisions between her and the other hostages, she said.  After such lows, how did Betancourt survive the long years?  "To put it in just one word, I think it was love," she said. "The love of my children and the love of my mother."  Reflecting on the current political situation in Colombia, the former candidate said that the country is in better shape than when she was abducted. There remains, however, what she called a crucial problem: a disconnect between those who live in the cities very comfortably, and those in the countryside who are affected by the violence of the FARC and other rebel groups.  "We have 4 million misplaced people in Colombia. And that's because of the war," she said.  
 Back in 2010, Google launched a short-lived social network service called "Buzz." Instead of simply promoting Buzz and urging users to sign up for it, or opt in, Google chose instead to sign up Gmail users as Buzz users. If users weren't happy, they could always opt out.  It was a mess. Private e-mail addresses became publicly available as social network contacts. Users rebelled. The Federal Trade Commission investigated, Google backed off, and eventually the company settled with the FTC and agreed not to rope users into new services that they haven't signed up for.  Now Google is back at it.  This week the company announced that it was tying the inboxes of Gmail users to  Google+ users. By using Gmail addresses to autocomplete messages from Google+ users, Google is basically giving strangers who may not know your e-mail address a way to connect with you through Gmail. This move may bolster short-term value for Google but reduces privacy for Gmail users.  This announcement is partly about the ongoing competition with Facebook, but it is also about Google's increasing integration of user data across various Internet services. That happened when Google decided to revise its privacy policy for Gmail and other Google products so that it could target more advertising and do more profiling of users.  The consequences for users and for the Internet are troubling. From a privacy perspective, Google's action makes it more likely that personal information of users will become more widely available. And as the Internet's most dominant company, Google is exploiting its control over key Internet services to beat back competition and expand its market reach. Those who favor a free, open and democratic Internet should take note.  Google is also unfairly expecting Gmail users to opt out of a service they never signed up for to maintain their current expectations of privacy.  It's fine if some users like the new feature. They should be free to opt in. But those who value privacy should not be expected to check their privacy settings every time a company alters its business model.  With the latest change to Gmail, Google is testing the resolve of regulators to protect privacy. If government officials do not intervene, things could get much worse.  At the moment, Google is simply using Gmail account addresses to auto-complete e-mail addresses for Google+. But of course Google is sitting on the biggest search database in the world and could also use that data it has collected from users to auto-complete e-mail addresses and much more.  In 2010, Google was right to back off the plan for Buzz and the Federal Trade Commission was right to pursue an investigation and help ensure that similar fiascos do not occur. But now that Google is once again commingling data in e-mail accounts and social network accounts, the Federal Trade Commission will need to intervene. Opting out is not the solution.

White House officials are scratching their heads over the decision by Republicans to sue President Barack Obama over his decision to delay a requirement in the health care law for businesses to provide coverage to employees.  That's because, as one senior administration official pointed out on Friday, those same lawmakers voted to do the exact same thing at virtually the exact same timedefer until 2015 the part of Obamacare known as the employer mandate.  House Speaker John Boehner justified last July's vote, held days after the Obama administration action, as a repudiation of the executive decision to alter a major part of the politically-charged law just months before it was put into practice.  "I get to look at the Constitution once in a while. The Constitution makes it clear that Congress writes the law, and the President takes the oath of office to faithfully discharge the laws that are on the books," Boehner said.  The House voted separately to delay the Obamacare individual mandate as well, another centerpiece of the landmark 2010 law that remains in place and requires everyday Americans to have some kind of health insurance. Both the business and individual mandates required compliance to avoid possible fines.  The two House votes drew significant Democratic support but the Democratic-led Senate didn't take up either.  Obamacare fight continues  The reference to last year's vote by the Republican-led House signals White House confidence that Boehner's lawsuit announced on Thursday night will fail in court.  House Republicans tried to use their constitutional powers to delay the mandate but failed, the White House thinking goes.  Boehner consulted legal experts before announcing the action and CNN's Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh reported that they were advised that keeping the focus of any legal challenge narrow offered the best chance to succeed in court.  The suit first must be authorized by legislation before being submitted in federal court by private attorneys. The timing of a court filing is unclear.  Obamacare is the signature domestic policy achievement of Obama's presidency so far. It's aimed at fulfilling his promise to make health care coverage available to millions without it.  Since October, the administration says 9 million people have signed up for a range of policies through federal and state insurance markets.  But it has also been a bitter partisan flashpoint since its approval in 2010 without GOP support. Republicans have made it a focus of their sharp political attacks on Obama and Democrats ahead of November's midterms with control of the Senate at stake.  "In terms of politics, there is no issue that Republicans have the best chance of riling up the base than Obamacare," Bash said.  The case also magnifies a toxic partisan climate that has engulfed Congress overall and come to define Obama's relations with Republicans in general. Some arch-conservatives in the party want him impeached.  Pushing forward  Boehner doesn't agree with such a step, but he's plowing ahead with an unusual legal challenge built around Republican claims Obama has abused his authority at the expense of the legislative process.  Obama defiantly challenged Republicans last week, saying he would continue to take steps he felt were necessary with or without the support of congressional Republicans.  "So sue me," he dared them.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest quickly dismissed Boehner's decision to take his case court as a "political stunt."  The President "is doing his joblawsuit or notand it's time Republicans in Congress did theirs," Earnest said in a statement.  Boehner argued the employer mandate delay is the best legal avenue for his case against Republican claims that Obama has overstepped his executive authority in carrying out his priorities.  "In 2013, the President changed the health care law without a vote of Congress, effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it," Boehner said in a statement Thursday.  "That's not the way our system of government was designed to work.  No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own," Boehner said.  House Republicans point to the support they received from constitutional scholars who testified on the Obamacare mandate delay last December.  Obama overreach?  At a House Judiciary Committee hearing, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, a once fierce critic of the Bush administration, suggested Obama overreached.  "The President is required to faithfully execute the laws. He's not required to enforce all laws equally or commit the same resources to them," he said. "But I believe the President has crossed the constitutional line."  Administration officials have repeatedly argued that alterations to the Affordable Care Act are legal.  In February 2013, a Treasury Department spokeswoman told Government Executive the administration has the power to delay the employer mandate and its fines, which are in essence taxes on businesses that do not comply with the law.  The taxing authority of the federal government was the legal underpinning of the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the sweeping health law and its individual mandate in 2012.  But other legal experts have already said any lawsuit around executive authority would face challenges.  In order for it to be formally considered by the courts, House Republicans must prove that the chamber was somehow injured as an institution.

 A federal grand jury indicted a man arrested last week in connection with a mysterious case of exposure to the deadly biological agent ricin, prosecutors said.  Authorities found ricin, weapons and an anarchist manual in Roger Von Bergendorff's Nevada hotel room.  Roger Von Bergendorff, 57, was indicted on charges of possession of a biological toxin, possession of unregistered firearms and possession of firearms not identified by serial number, said Natalie Collins, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Bergendorff was hospitalized for two months with suspected ricin poisoning, and was discharged before his arrest.  His initial court appearance was last week, Collins said, and he did not enter a plea. An arraignment is scheduled for May 2.  Bergendorff was hospitalized in February complaining of breathing difficulties. Two weeks later, Thomas Tholen, a cousin who went to Bergendorff's Las Vegas hotel room to recover his belongings, discovered what turned out to be ricin.  Authorities also said a search of the room found four guns, the book "Anarchist's Cookbook," a collection of instructions on poisons and other dangerous recipes and castor beans, syringes and beakers. Ricin is extracted from ground-up castor beans.  Tholen was charged earlier in April with failing to report the commission of a crime. A federal grand jury indicted him for allegedly concealing the knowledge that production and possession of a biological agenta felonywas being committed.  Bergendorff previously lived in Tholen's home in Riverton, Utah, just south of Salt Lake City. After the ricin was discovered, the FBI searched that home as well as storage units Bergendorff used in Utah.  Authorities said FBI agents searching the storage units found castor beans, chemicals used in the production of ricin, a respirator, filters, laboratory glassware, syringes and a notebook on ricin production.  If convicted as charged, Bergendorff would face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. E-mail to a friend

A Florida highway patrolman who ordered the opening of an interstate highway, despite dense fog and smoke from a nearby brush fire, had not received any formal training on opening or closing roads and was not aware of the agency's relevant policy or procedures, according to an investigation into the deadly January crashes that left 11 people dead.  Lt. John Gourley ordered the road reopened when conditions improved on Interstate 75 because he considered it dangerous not to, he told investigators, according to a state report released Thursday. Gourley cited the potential for secondary crashes as a result of prolonged road closures based on his prior experience as a reason for the decision.  Despite reservations expressed by Sgt. Bruce Simmons, who said he was worried about allowing traffic to resume too soon, Gourley proceeded with the reopening.  "I'm concerned that another cloud might roll through and then we got to go through all this again," said Simmons, according to the report.  "That's why we need to go ahead get DOT (the Florida Department of Transportation) to get signs and assets in place if we need to shut down where we did, we can do it," Gourley responded. "Keep monitoring it but right at this point, I see no reason to keep it closed."  The report said troopers did not act with criminal intent but also "failed to adequately communicate critical information amongst themselves regarding the fire on Paynes Prairie."  Gourley was not immediately available for comment.  The report also blamed the agency for failing "to adequately create and implement effective guidelines" for its troopers to follow when dealing with poor visibility on roadways. And those training measures in place were considered "ineffective and poorly memorialized," it said.  After Gourley reopened the highway, there were not adequate resources dedicated to monitor subsequent road conditions, the report found.  About 20 minutes before the fatal crashes, Trooper Steven Downing reported seeing dense smoke less than a mile east of Interstate 75, where the vehicle accidents would occur. But "no immediate measures were taken" to monitor the conditions in that area following his report, it added.  Downing later responded to a nearby crash that involved six vehicles, which occurred near Gainesville.  The National Weather Service had warned that patchy smoke and fog may have been present in the area.  Lidiane Carmo, 15, was injured and lost most of her family in the I-75 pileup.  The teen's case drew widespread attention after church members said she was an illegal immigrant from Brazil, and they were afraid she could face deportation. But federal officials said in February that she would be allowed to stay in the country.  
 There didn't seem to be too much that Robin Williams couldn't do.  As an actor, he had the range to go from playing a loveable alien on the small screen in "Mork & Mindy" to winning an Academy Award for his portrayal of Professor Sean Maguire in "Good Will Hunting." Whether it was spastic slapstick or heart-rending drama, the actor, who died on Monday from an apparent suicide, was as prolific in his career as he was hilarious.  Evidence of that work ethic won't end with his death.  There are four completed Williams films expected to be released posthumously: "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb," "Merry Friggin' Christmas," "Boulevard," and "Absolutely Anything." Given his love for his craft and his fans, the final work feels like a gift left behind by the beloved actor.  Williams was known for taking on as many projects as he possibly could. In a 2010 interview with The Guardian, the actor said heart surgery in 2009 helped him to ease his pace a bit.  "In one two-year period I made eight movies," Williams reflected. "At one point the joke was that there's a movie out without you in it. You have this idea that you'd better keep working, otherwise people will forget. And that was dangerous. And then you realize, no, actually if you take a break people might be more interested in you. Now, after the heart surgery, I'll take it slow."  Gilbert Gottfried: Robin Williams' generous heart  Set for release in December, "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb" saw Williams revisiting his role of Teddy Roosevelt, which he had portrayed in earlier films in the series.  "There really are no words to describe the loss of Robin Williams," said a statement from 20th Century Fox, the studio behind the movie. "He was immensely talented, a cherished member of our community, and part of the Fox family. Our hearts go out to his family, friends and fans. He will be deeply missed."  Complete coverage on Robin Williams  Williams also completed a role in the holiday comedy "Merry Friggin Christmas," which is set to be released in November. The film centers around father Boyd Mitchler, played by Joel McHale, who realizes he has left behind his son's gifts while on holiday with his estranged family. Williams stars as McHale's father, who makes the trek with him to retrieve the presents in time.  "When you talk to Robin you think, 'I have learned more in the last 20 minutes than I ever learned,'" McHale told the New York Daily News earlier this year. "He is such an open soul and one of the most sensitive and great guys..."  Known for his voice work in films like Disney's "Aladdin," Williams provided the voice of Dennis the Dog in "Absolutely Anything," which will be released in 2015 and costars Kate Beckinsale and Simon Pegg. But it is his role in the drama "Boulevard," which premiered at the Tribecca Film Festival in April, that may become the most discussed and heralded of Williams' final films.  Robin Williams and the dark side of comedy  In it, Williams plays a married man who comes to terms with his homosexuality later in life and connects emotionally with a young male prostitute played by Roberto Aguire.  "Tapping into that same loneliness felt in 'One Hour Photo' and 'Good Will Hunting,' the actor projects a regret so deep and identifiable, viewers should have no trouble connecting it to whatever is missing in their own lives  whether those regrets are romantic, sexual, professional or spiritual," critic Peter Debruge wrote in a review of the movie for Variety.  During a Reddit "Ask Me Anything" session with fans in 2013, Williams said he couldn't choose between comedies or dramas.  "I like doing both comedies and dramas, so it's very difficult to say which one I prefer," he said. "I've been very blessed to have had the chance to explore such a variety of characters."

Hong Kong Exports of French Bordeaux, Italian Tuscans and Spanish Riojas could get more expensive in China if a tit-for-tat tariff war bubbles over between the world's most populous country and the European Union.  On Wednesday, Beijing launched anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probes into imports of European wine. The inquiry follows new EU tariffs, only announced Tuesday, of nearly 12% on China-made solar panels that begin June 6. The European Commission has accused China's state-subsidized panel makers of flooding European markets with unfairly cheap products.  In a public statement, China's Ministry of Commerce said it had "received requests from domestic wine companies, accusing European wine companies of entering the Chinese market by dumping products, receiving subsidies and other unfair measures. Based on these requests, the Ministry of Commerce will initiate a serious investigation according to laws and regulations."  "This is what we call 'strategic play' in game theory. It is an action which is intended to have benefits in negotiation," says Dr. Xu Bin, Professor of Economics and Finance at the China Europe International Business School, or CEIBS, in Shanghai.  China is smart to pick on Europe's wine industry, adds Xu, because it is "not core to Europe's economy" yet "symbolic enough" that it will have an "immediate impact" on people's hearts and minds.  If a tariff war ensued, "it would be very damaging for France," says Carl Crook, Managing Director of Montrose Wines, one of China's biggest importers of foreign wine.  France is China's number one exporter of wines. In 2012, the country shipped more than 700,000 bottles to China, more than four times the volume of second-ranked Australia, according to the China Customs Information Center.  Yet Crook believes a tariff warif kept briefmay actually help the bottom lines of China's foreign wine importers in the longer term. From 2002 to 2012, China's total imports of foreign bottled wine rocketed nearly 15,000% to more than 1.3 million bottles. But from 2011 to 2012, growth trickled to an anemic 8%.  "There has been a lot of enthusiastic buying that needs to be depleted," says Crook. "There is excellent inventory to last a short trade war. I'm not as alarmed as I think I should be."  While a quick tariff war might encourage Chinese consumers to drink their imported wine stocksand replenish their suppliesa longer tariff war would have a more ambiguous impact, with potential winners and losers both in China and around the world.  "New world wines are waiting for this opportunity," says Crook. "Australia, Chile, Argentina and South Africa are well positioned." Both Chile and New Zealand recently implemented bilateral trade agreements with China that lowered duties on wine imports to zero percent, he adds.  "I don't think it's a good thing for us," says Judy Leissner, President of Grace Vineyards, a well-known domestic Chinese boutique label that aims to keep volumes at or below two million bottles each year. "Yes, we are in competition with imported wine, but that imported wine helps educate consumers. If consumers are more highly educated then it's better for us all."  Leissner expects a tariff war would only lead to a short-term jump in sales and that big-name, high-volume Chinese wine suppliers like Great Wall, Chang Yu and Dynasty would benefit most.  "If prices rise because of a tariff war, China's wine companies will have less reason to do better," adds Leissner. "Human beings are lazy."  Looking ahead, early August is the deadline to a tariff resolution.  In two months, the EU tariff of 11.8% on Chinese solar panels will rise to an average of 47.6%. If talks fail before then, the EU will decide in December whether to impose duties on panels for a maximum of five years.  "Ideally it would be better for both sides to retreat from their current positions," says Xu of CEIBS. "I understand the European economy is not in good shape, so there is a lot of pressure from domestic lobbies for protection from other countries."  "In the end, both will yield some inches," says Xu. "There is no winner in a trade war."  
 Air traffic controllers may be taking more risks in handling airliners under a 2-year-old rule allowing them to report errors without fear of punishment, congressional investigators say in a report highlighting a spike in incidents.  Controllers and the FAA, however, say the rule has actually improved safety.  The report by the Government Accountability Officewhich notes a 53 percent increase in controller errors within five miles of airports and a 166 percent jump in errors handling approaching flights up to 40 miles outcomes at a time of remarkable commercial aviation safety in the United States. The nation has not seen a fatal airliner crash since 2009, the same year the rule went into effect.  The increase in errors "began a notable climb in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, peaked in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, and remained at rates higher than the historical average through the second quarter of 2011," the GAO said in its report.  The FAA says the jump coincides with the non-punitive reporting rule, which took effect in July 2009. That system encourages air traffic controllers to voluntarily report errors so that dangerous patterns can be identified and the system can be made safer, the agency said.  The system, which protects controllers who report efforts from legal or disciplinary action,  has "produced a wealth of information to help the FAA identify potential risks in the system and make corrections," FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said.  "More information will help us find problems and take action before an accident happens," she said.  But the GAO said  FAA officials who are not identified in the report told investigators that the system also may reduce personal accountability and "may make some air traffic controllers less risk averse in certain situations." That may have led to more errors, according to the GAO, which also said some FAA officials told them the rule also limits the ability of managers to take action against employees who make a mistake.  The GAO also said 65% of the errors reported through the non-punitive system, some of which may have involved violations of the standards separating aircraft in flight, were not fed into a separate FAA reporting system for operational errors. That may have reduced the number of errors directly reported to FAA supervisors, the GAO said.  Rep. Thomas E. Petri, the Aviation Subcommittee chairman and one of six Congress members who requested the GAO study, said the spike in errors raises significant concerns.  "Airlines and FAA controllers alike share credit for the safety record we enjoy today," Petri, a Wisconsin Republican, said in a written statement. "However, the recent uptick in near miss events is a precursor to tragedy."  But Paul Rinaldi, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said his take on the report is that it shows the FAA has "taken several steps to further improve safety at and around airports."  Bill Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, said he supports the FAA's non-punitive reporting system, saying it is bringing to light errors that would have gone unreported under the old system.  But he said the new system, by itself, can not explain all of the increases in controller errors.  "A jump is inevitable when you change your reporting system. You worry if you don't have a jump because you feel like something hasn't worked," Voss said. "But when you look underneath these numbers, as GAO has done very carefully, you can't explain everything away by a change of reporting. It looks like there's some substance to it too, and that has to be dealt with."

LOS ANGELES, California A third person died Friday from an explosion at a rocket test pad operated by a private company in California's southern Mojave Desert, according to the nursing supervisor at Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield.  A bird's eye view of the scene in Mojave, California, shows charred wreckage and large pieces of debris.  The explosion, which occurred Thursday at the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, initially killed two people and critically injured four others.  On Friday three people remained hospitalizedtwo in critical condition, one in serious condition.  The six were employed by Scaled Composites, an aerospace development company founded 25 years ago by Burt Rutan, the aerospace engineer who designed the first plane to fly nonstop around the world without refueling.  According to Rutan, the blast occurred during a test involving nitrous oxide flowing through fuel injectors. A source said the workers were testing components of a new rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo, which is a spaceship being built for Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's space tourism company.  "We were doing a test that we believed was completely safe. ... We don't know why it exploded," said Rutan, who was not at the site at the time of the accident.  Watch the aftermath of the explosion   The explosion happened during a "cold fire test," he said.  A spokeswoman for the space port, which is about 80 miles north of Los Angeles, said the blast was on a remote pad and that the area had been contained.  Aerial video of the blast aftermath showed a charred and twisted flatbed trailer attached to a truck cab with a large silver tank next to it. Large pieces of debris appeared to be strewn for hundreds of yards from the center.  Rutan won the Ansari X-Prize in 2004 for the first repeat sub-orbital space flight with his pioneering SpaceShipOne.  SpaceShipTwo is a small carbon fiber craft designed to carry seven passengers up to 65 miles above the earth, traveling at a speed of about 12,000 mph. A ticket for such a ride was expected to cost $200,000.  Entering the edge of space those on board will experience weightlessness for about 15 minutes before beginning the journey back to earth.  "What we're trying to do is make space travel affordable and fun. Two years from now we'll be starting to take ordinary people into space," Branson told CNN in 2006.

 Des Moines, Iowa Martin O'Malley told reporters in Iowa on Friday that inevitabilitya term bandied about regarding Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clintonis not unbreakable.  "I've seen it before," the former Governor of Maryland and possible presidential contender said. "History is full of examples where the inevitable frontrunner was inevitable right up until she was no longer or he was no longer inevitable."  Clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to Barack Obama.  O'Malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month.  The former governor, who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the Polk County Democrats in Des Moines, said that although Clinton is an "eminently qualified candidate," the Democratic Party is full of "good leaders."  "History is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of Iowa," O'Malley said.  In some polls, he has scored in the low single digits in the state.  In a March CNN/ORC poll of national Democrats, only 1% picked O'Malley. In a January poll by Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register, O'Malley was also at 1% among Iowa Democrats.  Clinton, who leads most polls by upwards of 40 points, is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, a person close to her campaign-in-waiting told CNN on Friday.  While he wouldn't say much about Clinton, when asked about her candidacy, O'Malley said, "if leaders believe that they have the experience and the framework to move our country forward, they should run. And they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it."  O'Malley, like other Democrats, appears to refrain from directly attacking Clinton. Although last month on ABC, he said that the presidency is "not some crown to be passed between two families," he has not focused on her.  He has, however, openly teased a presidential run.  "I know that, as Democrats, we expectand I have heard this all over the countrythe Democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face," he said. "They believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary."  He concluded: "It would be an extreme poverty indeed if there was only one person willing to compete for our party's nomination for President."

Maria Sharapova remains on course to complete a career slam after she set up a French Open semifinal showdown with Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova.  The Russian dispatched Kaia Kanepi, from Estonia, 6-2 6-3 and now needs just two more victories to join an exclusive club in the game who have won all four grand slam titles.  The world No. 2 has reached the final four at Roland Garros twice before and beat Kvitova, from the Czech Republic, in the semifinals in Stuttgarta tournament she went on to win.  But Kvitova's only grand slam win to date came at last year's Wimbledon tournament, when she beat Sharapova in straight sets in the final.  "It's nice to be in this position again," Sharapova told the WTA Tour's official website. "It's my third time in the semifinals here.  "Petra's an extremely tough opponent, someone I have had good success in our last couple of meetings, but they're always tough matches.  "The last one in Stuttgart was a tough two-setter for meshe had opportunities in that second set and when she's confident, she's dangerous. It's going to be another level. I hope I can raise my level, as well."  None of the four French Open semifinalists has tasted success in Paris, but Sharapova has the most major championships to her name, with three overall.  The Russian never looked in any trouble against Kanepi, breaking her opponent seven times en route to a swift victory, and the 26-year-old admitted she could not live with Sharapova's power.  "She attacked all the time, I didn't have any time to hit my shots and I just couldn't get any rhythm out there," Kanepi explained.  "I was also very nervous and I am just sorry I didn't get to spend more time on the court. Maria is playing really well, she can win the tournament."  Kvitova, the No. 4 seed, dropped the first set against qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan, who knocked out defending champion Li Na in the previous round, but battled back to win 3-6 6-2 6-4.  It ended Shvedova's hopes of becoming the first qualifier ever to reach the Roland Garros semis, and propelled Kvitova closer to her second grand slam final appearance.  "Every point that we played was really tough," Kvitova said in a courtside interview. "I knew that I had to change my game.  "It wasn't easy and I'm really happy that my serve helped me and I played my aggressive game again."  The other semifinal sees Australia's Samantha Stosur, the No. 6 seed, square off against Italian Sara Errani, the No. 21 seed.  
 Beijing Clashes in the unsettled western Chinese region of Xinjiang killed 21 people, including police officers and local officials, authorities said Wednesday.  The attacks took place Tuesday afternoon after three local officials visiting homes in the area found "several suspicious persons" and knives in one house, the Xinjiang government said in a statement.  When the officials alerted their superiors of the situation, the people in the house took them hostage, the statement said. Police rushed to the scene, and in the ensuing violence, six of the assailants and 15 other people were killed, it said. Two other people were injured.  Police captured eight of the attackers, whom the government described as "mobsters." It described the violence as a "terrorist act."  Some of the knives recovered by police were more than a meter long, according to Hou Hanmin, spokesperson for the Xinjiang government. She told CNN that some of the captured assailants said under interrogation that they had watched videos "from overseas" that featured violence and acts of terrorism.  "Then they made those large, lethal knives and wanted to use them for Jihad," she said, referring to the Arabic term meaning "struggle."  "They had been training in their own house for several months. They were affected by extremism and hoped to commit themselves to Jihad."  Xinjiang has been hit by periodic bouts of unrest. The worst violence in decades took place in July 2009, when rioting between Uyghurs and Han Chinese left around 200 people dead and 1,700 injured in the regional capital, Urumqi.  Uyghurs are predominantly Muslim ethnic Turks who are linguistically, culturally and religiously distinct from China's majority Han population.  The Uyghur American Association, which advocates for Uyghur rights, said the Chinese accounts of the violence this week "should be viewed with extreme caution given the lack of available details and independent verification of Chinese sources."  The Washington-based association accused Chinese officials of regularly exploiting incidents in the region to use them as evidence of a perceived terrorist plot against the Chinese state.  "The Chinese government regularly makes terror allegations against Uyghurs without producing evidence to back up their claims or allowing international investigators to independently verify their version of events," the association said in a statement Wednesday.  Chinese authorities have cracked down on those they accuse of fomenting unrest in the region.  As is often the case, the government statement about Tuesday's clash didn't specify the ethnicity of the assailants. But it said that the 15 people killed who weren't "mobsters" comprised 10 Uyghurs, three Han, and two Mongolians.  The latest violence occurred in Bachu County, east of the city of Kashgar.  CNN's Ivan Watson and Feng Ke in Beijing contributed to this report.

Cold water and nude beaches don't necessarily mix well.  Add to the equation a very conservative society and the idea of a nude beach seems rather ambitious, if not impossible.  In a surprisingly creative tourism push, officials in north east Gangwon Province are aiming to set up South Korea's first nude beach, with the first clothes to be shed in 2017.  It's an effort to boost tourism to the peninsula's east coast beaches, which lose out every year to the west coast in luring summer visitors from the capital Seoul.  Although the east coast has more beautiful, sandy beaches, the water tends to be colder, the season shorter and the distance from Seoul is greater than the beaches to the west.  The massively popular annual mud festival is also held on the west coast.  Skinny dip-friendly  "This is part of our plans to create beaches with specific purpose, like a beach for families, a beach for couples, a beach for pets, and yes, a nude beach," said an official from the municipality's Pan-East Sea Division at a seminar on Tuesday, according to the Korea Times.  Calls by CNN to officials were not answered on Thursday.  Somewhat surprisingly, this is not the first time the subject has been broached by government officials.  And in the past it's the public that's shuttered the idea.  Gangwon Province tried to launch a female-only nude beach in 2005, while Gangneung City also deliberated, but ultimately scrapped, a nude beach idea due to public outcry. The same happened to a Jeju Island proposal in 2009.  Which beach?  Officials have not yet decided which beach may be the first to go nude. They are also deliberating over a trial operation for foreigners only.  The premise is foreigners will be much more comfortable with the concept than locals.  "Koreans actually love nude beaches when they're traveling abroad, but the problem with having one within Korea is the fact that Korean society is so interconnected," Seoul-based travel reporter Chun Kyoung-woo told CNN.  "They won't be able to comfortably go to a nude beach due to the thought that people they know will find out about it quite easily."  That threat is reinforced given the country's has second-highest smartphone penetration rate in the world (73%, just behind United Arab Emirates' 73.8%) and a staggering 82.7% Internet penetration rate.  Early reaction to the concept was skeptical.  Twitter user @amudoan: "Doubtful that people will actually go. And even if they do, it'll be 99.99% guys." @KR_Nanoha tweeted "why don't they just call it a men's sauna?" (Both comments translated here into English).  
 (RollingStone.com )It's been five years since Prince put out a new record in the United States, since he limited the release of his 20Ten LP, but that will change this fall.  On September 30th, the artist will release two new records: Plectrumelectrum, his long-teased album with the group 3rdEyeGirl, and his recently announced solo LP, Art Official Age. He will reportedly hold a series of special events and live dates around the world, details for which are forthcoming, to celebrate the albums' release. Both records are available separately as pre-orders, via the website ArtOfficialAge.com, and include "instant gratification" downloads.  Art Official Age is being billed as "classic Prince," since it was produced, arranged, composed and performed by the musician (alongside singer-songwriter Joshua Welton). The record reportedly contains a mix of soul, R&B and funk. The pre-order includes the songs "Breakdown" and "Clouds," as well as three digital singles. The funky, jazzy latter track is now streaming at Complex.  RS: Prince's 15 best post-eighties deep cuts  Prince has already released the video for album track "Breakfast Can Wait" and he played "Funknroll" during his appearance on Arsenio earlier this year, though the version on Art Official Age is "funkier and nastier," according to a Minneapolis Star Tribune writer who got an early listen. The reporter also claimed that "This Could Be Us" was a ballad inspired by Prince's Purple Rain costar Apollonia Kotero and that "The Gold Standard" had lyrics "wild and rude." The writer also said the album contained an "aggressive and menacing" rap song featuring Rita Ora.  Plectrumelectrum, a "classic band album" that is said to be an "electrifying funk-rock statement," features the singer leading the all-female group ThirdEyeGirl. The ensemble test-drove a number of the record's songs on their recent Hit and Run tours. "No one can play like this band," Prince told Rolling Stone about the record. "People are going to try, but they won't be able to."  RS: Zooey Deschanel talks Prince collaboration  He also previewed the record at a late-night listening session in New York City, which revealed the hard-rock guitar number (and pre-order instant-gratification track) "Pretzelbodylogic," as well as the original version of "Funknroll." Notably absent from the record is Prince's duet with Zooey Deschanel, "Fallinlove2night," which got its debut on The New Girl in March.  The records mark Prince's return to Warner Bros., the label he split from acrimoniously in the Nineties after wearing the word "slave" on his face as a protest to his record contract. "When you stop a man from dreaming, he becomes a slave," he told Rolling Stone in 1996. "That's where I was. I don't own Prince's music. If you don't own your masters, your master owns you."  Earlier this year, Prince worked out a deal with the label where he now owns the masters to his recordings. The label previously announced a plan to put out a deluxe, digitally remastered, 30th anniversary release of the Purple Rain soundtrack, though it has yet to announce a release date.  RS: Prince on Label Heads: 'They're Always at the Beach With Their Kids'  "Prince is one of just a handful of visionary artists who have truly reshaped and redefined modern music and culture," Warner Bros. Chairman & CEO Cameron Strang said in a statement about the two new records. "For the past 35 years, he has never stopped evolving, challenging himself, reinventing his sound and pushing boundaries. In true Prince fashion, he has just given us not one, but two extraordinary albums that express the incredible range and depth of his talent. All of us at WBR are immensely proud to be working with Prince to bring this brilliant new music to his legions of fans around the world, and needless to say we are thrilled to be working in partnership with him again."

A blond girl found in Greece whose birth parents were traced to a Bulgarian Roma village will be cared for by a foster family when she's returned to Bulgaria, the government's social services agency said  Maria, as the girl was known by the Roma couple with whom she was living in central Greece, was at the center of an international mystery after police discovered her.  DNA tests eventually showed that Saska Ruseva and her husband, Atanas Rusev, were her biological parents.  Her mother told CNN that she wants her child backbut that seems unlikely to happen for now.  Maria, now being cared for by Greek children's charity Smile of a Child, will instead be cared for by a foster family.  The parents and their nine children have been living in poverty in a tumbledown, one-room mud brick house in the village of Nikolaevo, in central Bulgaria.  Emil Todorov, director of the Children Protection Department of Bulgaria's Agency for Social Assistance, told CNN it was not yet clear what documents Maria would arrive with.  Bulgaria's State Child Protection Agency has yet to say exactly when and how the girl will be brought from Greece, he said. Her interactions with her birth family will be determined by who is named as her legal guardian, he said.  The Agency for Social Assistance is also taking action to care for the Bulgarian parents' seven underage children.  The two youngest, ages 2 and 3, will stay with one foster family, said Todorov. Two other children will stay with another foster family, and a 15-year-old will stay with family members.  The remaining two, ages 8 and 12, will be staying at a specialized institution, because no appropriate foster families are available to take them in, he said.  Working with the parents  The placement of the children in foster care is only a temporary stage, Todorov said.  The goal is to give the parents the chance to improve their living conditionsin which case they can be reunited with their children. Social services will help the parents find a job, he said.  "We have to work with both parents, so that they can expand their parental potential," said Todorov.  While the children are in foster care, social workers will encourage frequent meetings with their parents, so that the family maintains its emotional connection, he said.  "We don't take away the children," he said. "We count on the collaboration by the whole family to cope with this difficult situation."  The Agency for Social Assistance said it had determined the parents had another child too, who was "abandoned by her parents and raised by a family in another city."  Bulgarian police are investigating the Rusevs on suspicion they sold Maria for illegal adoption. A Greek Roma coupleChristos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulowho were found looking after the girl are in custody, charged with kidnapping.  Daughter given away, says mother  Ruseva told CNN that she and her husband left for Greece in 2009 to look for farm work. She says she left her eldest daughter Katia, now 20 years old, to care for the family while they were away.  Ruseva says she was so thin she did not realize she was pregnant with Maria. "I didn't know I was pregnant. I didn't even have a belly," she said.  Mariawhom Ruseva originally named Stankawas born in a hospital in the Greek town of Lamia, about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from Farsala and the Roma camp where she was discovered this month.  Ruseva said she cared for Maria for seven months while her husband worked in poorly paying odd jobs, picking fruit and vegetables. They often slept in the streets or nearby olive groves, as they had so little money.  Then one day, when they took a job picking oranges, a woman offered to take care of their daughter and they gave her to the woman because they couldn't care for her themselves, Ruseva said. She denies selling the baby, saying she loves her and wants her back.  CNN's Karl Penhaul contributed to this report.  
 Washington Federal agents watched in horror as an unknown male in an internet photo appealed for stomach-churning advicehow to rape the child beside him.  The girl was in pajamas and the man appeared intent on abusing her sometime soon.  Homeland Security agents knew they were in a race against time to save the girl.  In a narrow, windowless office outside Washington, DC, Special Agent Jim Cole sits at a bank of computer screens. The room is modest but the technology Cole is using is second to none.  He showed CNN's Freedom Project how Homeland Security Investigations agents chase down child pornographers. The tone in his voice changes when he begins to tell us about the 11-year-old girl and the special case, which the agency has termed "Sunflower."  "This Sunflower series [of photos] was being posted by an individual who was looking for information on how best to rape this little girl and get away with it."  Cole, who has daughters of his own, says he began scanning the photos being posted online for any clues that might give away their location. And he knew, he didn't have much time.  "The advice he was getting online ranged from drugging her to brutally attacking her," says Cole. "It was progressing so we were extremely concerned for her welfare."  The agent noticed a blurry highway road sign in the window. It was his first, and best, clue. He and his colleagues set to work.  The road sign looked like a sunflower logoa clue that led agents to Kansas where the sunflower is the state flower.  And the first number on the sign was surely a 2. But the other numbers were too blurred to be sure which road it was.  "We began looking at the road sign. It really looked to most of us like a highway 203, and there was a highway 203 in Kansas, [but] when we got there, got off the plane the agent from Kansas said "it's not 203, we just drove the whole highway, the sign's not there.""  So Cole and the other agents got back on the road and started driving every highway in Kansas that starts with a 2.  "At the very end of the highway where it teed into another highway, we found the sign. I jumped out of the vehicle on a very busy highway and almost got hit by a car."  Knowing the approximate location, Cole called the local sheriff's department, who recognized a backyard swimming pool in another one of the photos.  They conducted a raid; arresting the suspect before the exploitation could escalate to the point of rape.  "When we went in that morning, [the 11-year-old girl] was still wearing those same pajamas as depicted in the images."  An ICE spokeswoman said the girl is now safe and living with her parents. She added the suspect turned out to also be a minor --16 years oldwho pleaded guilty and was sentenced to serve 48 months in a juvenile facility.  Former ICE Director John Morton, speaking in January, touted the success of this raid and subsequent onesnamed Operation Sunflower after the Kansas casethat rescued 123 children, reminded Americans that while there was good news to report, the dangers that children face online and elsewhere remain.  "As satisfying as the arrests in Operation Sunflower have been, today is obviously a day of mixed emotions because this operation is ultimately a tale of the perverse, pervasive and violent exploitation of children - very young children to satisfy the dark pleasures of a group of twisted adults," said Morton.  "Sadly, some of the children were very young. For example, some of the children we rescued were between the ages of two and three. Nine children were between the ages of four and six."  Already in the first six months of 2013, HSI agents have rescued 337 child victims, and they've taken 964 alleged child predators off the street.

France has booked a place in the Davis Cup final after taking an unassailable 3-0 lead over the Czech Republic in their semifinal tie at Roland Garros on Saturday.  Following straight-set victories for Jo-Wifried Tsonga and Richard Gasquet in Friday's singles, the French pair joined forces in the doubles to beat Radek Stepanek and Tomas Berdych in four sets 6-7 (4/7) 6-4 7-6 (7/5) 6-1.  "It's for sure one of the best moments in our career to play here in a semifinal and to win in the second day," Tsonga said.  "We always kept the fighting spirit and stayed in the matchwe all know the Davis Cup is tough."  Victory over the reigning champions means France advance to the final for the first time since 2010, where they will face either Italy or Switzerland.  The Italian's slim hopes of reaching a first Davis Cup final since 1998 are still alive after a thrilling five-set win in Saturday's doubles rubber over the Swiss in Geneva.  Trailing 2-0 after Friday's singles matches, Italy entrusted their fate to Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini as they took on Stan Wawrinka and Marco Chiudinelli, who replaced Roger Federer who was rested by team captain Severin Luthi.  The match started brightly for the visitors as Bolelli and Fognini took the opening set 7-5 but the Swiss pair immediately hit back taking the second and third sets to leave Italy staring down the barrel.  But the Italian pair seemed unperturbed by the prospect of defeat, mounting an impressive comeback to square the match at two sets all before carrying the momentum into the decider to eventually win 7-5 3-6 5-7 6-3 6-2.  "I am much happier with my performance today," Fognini said after the marathon four-hour match.  "I served much better than yesterday, I returned much better. It's still going to be very difficult for us but it's a little less difficult than before," he added.  The 27-year-old will have to recover quickly for Sunday's opening reverse singles rubber where he faces 17-time grand slam champion Federer.  Victory for Federer would propel Switzerland to a first final in 22 years and a chance to claim the title for the first time in their history.  
 Two anti-whaling activists who were seized by a Japanese whaling vessel two days ago have been handed over to Australian government officials on a ship in the Antarctic, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Thursday.  Australian citizen Benjamin Potts and British citizen Giles Lane, both members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, jumped on board the Yushin Maru No. 2 Tuesday to deliver a letter saying the vessel was violating international law and Australian law by killing whales.  The anti-whaling group accused the crew of the Japanese vessel of kidnapping the men based on a video that showed Potts and Lane tied to the ship's railing. In the video, Japanese fishermen pace back and forth in front of them.  Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith Wednesday did not answer questions about whether the men would be charged for their actions, stressing instead that the immediate priority was to retrieve them.  "I'm not going to give a running commentary on who's done what to whom and the various allegations and counter allegation," he said.  Smith said the Japanese governmentwhich formally approached Australia to assist in the transferdid not lay out any conditions for the transfer, in which the men were brought on board the Australian ship, the Oceanic Viking.  Watch the anti-whaling activists board the Japanese vessel   Capt. Paul Watson, founder of Sea Shepherd, had said earlier that the men were seized by the Japanese crew and assaulted.  Watch Watson describe the incident   Sea Shepherd claims Japan's Institute for Cetacean Research, which is backing the operations, had said it would release the two activists if Sea Shepherd agrees to stop interfering in its whaling operations. The group says it will not agree to that demand.  The Japanese Fisheries Agency said Thursday it would readily hand over the two men.  But the agency charged that the Sea Shepherd members were the terrorists. At a news conference earlier, the agency released pictures of broken bottles they claim group members threw at the ship. They also released a photo of the two activists relaxing and drinking tea aboard the Yushin Maru.  "For some time, for 10, 15 minutes, I understand, they were tied to a GPS mast," Tomohiko Taniguchi of Japan's Foreign Ministry told CNN. "The Japanese crew members feared that two crew members from Sea Shepherd might do something violent."  He said Potts and Lane boarded the vessel without permission. Watson said the two boarded only after attempts to contact the ship by radio were unsuccessful.  Japan has been hunting whales in the Antarctic and apparently plans to kill as many as 1,000 this winter. The killings are allowed under international law because their main purpose is scientific.  "We regard them as poachers," Watson said. E-mail to a friend  CNN Correspondent Kyung Lah contributed to this report.

Skeletal remains found near an Arizona campground are believed to be those of a missing 2-year-old, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday.  Sylar Newton was reported missing July 25 from the Beaver Creek Campgrounds in Rimrock. Authorities said last week that the boy was presumed dead as they announced the launch of a criminal investigation into his disappearance.  The remains were found Tuesday afternoon at the bottom of a wash less than two miles from the campground, the sheriff's office said. The office said the remains "likely came to rest in this area due to recent flash flooding."  "At this time, the remains are believed to be that of Sylar Newton, but final confirmation is still pending," the sheriff's office said.  Sylar was last seen shortly after midnight July 24, sleeping in a tent with his family at the campgrounds. About 1:45 a.m. July 25, the family noticed that he was missing from his sleeping bag.  "The sheriff's office believes Sylar did not wander from the campground and he is presumably dead," Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh told a news conference last week. "The search effort is now in a recovery mode and the investigation has become criminal in nature."  Sylar was camping with his custodial mother, Christina Priem, and her children, when he disappeared. Priem has said she was in the process of adopting the boy from his biological mother.  Sheriff's spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said last month that "there's no evidence" that the planned adoption played a role in his disappearance, "but until we've exhausted every lead, all possibilities are being investigated."  About 25 other people were at the campground the night of Sylar's disappearanceall of whom have cooperated with investigators, according to the sheriff's office.  
 President Barack Obama congratulated Michael Sam on Saturday for being the first openly gay football player taken in the National Football League draft, the White House said in a statement.  "From the playing field to the corporate boardroom, LGBT Americans prove everyday that you should be judged by what you do and not who you are," Obama said. He also congratulated the NFL and the St. Louis Rams, the team that drafted Sam.  Sam, an All-American defensive end who played for the University of Missouri, made history when he was picked by the Rams in the seventh and final round. He was the 249th of 256 players selected.  The 24-year-old got the news by telephone from Rams' coach Jeff Fisher, who told Sam: "You are a Ram. The wait is finally over."  Sam, who was filmed by ESPN as he got the call, broke down in tears and kissed his boyfriend. "Thank you," he could be heard saying to Fisher.  Later, Sam took to Twitter to post a picture of himself, smiling. "Thank you to the St. Louis Rams and the whole city of St. Louis," he said in the post. "I'm using every (ounce) of this to achieve greatness!!"  See Sam's reaction  St. Louis is only a two-hour drive from Columbia, home of the University of Missouri, where Sam starred.  Besides being a first-team All-American, the 6-foot-2, 260-pounder was named the co-defensive player of the year in the Southeastern Conference, widely considered college football's best league. His fellow Tigers named him the team's most valuable player.  With those credentials, Sam was expected to be selected, but as the three-day draft wore on, there were questions whether he would.  Fisher told ESPN that Sam was a player who was rated by the team as going much higher in the draft.  "We weren't going to miss the opportunity to add an outstanding player to our roster," he said.  In February, Sam came out in interviews with ESPN and The New York Times, a decision that raised questions about whether he had damaged his chances to play in the NFL.  "I came to tell the world I'm an openly proud gay man," he said in an interview with ESPN.  Sam said he told his Missouri teammates in August and suffered no repercussions. He said he was surprised to discover many people in the media already knew he was gay.  "I understand how big this is," Sam said in the ESPN interview. "It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL."  Sam also spoke about his sexual orientation to The New York Times, saying: "I just want to make sure I could tell my story the way I want to tell it. I just want to own my truth."  At the start of the draft on Thursday, it appeared it was also on Sam's mind.  "No matter what happen(s) these next few days, I will always cherish moments like this!!!," he said in a post on Twitter.  Sam's draft was viewed as a barometer of whether the NFL was ready to accept an openly gay player. His selection is viewed as a bright spot for a league that has faced a host of criticism in recent months, from questions about the lack of minorities promoted to the number of players arrested for bad behavior.  "I think this is a good day, against the backdrop of what has happened in the NBA recently," Margaret Hoover, a political commentator and gay rights activist, told CNN.  The NFL Players Association also weighed in on Sam's good news.  "We wish him the best of luck as we do all of the 2014 NFL Draft class," said George Atallah, the association's assistant executive director of external affairs.  Other athletes have come out as gay, but they didn't have Sam's profile. Among them are the NBA's Jason Collins, the WNBA's Brittney Griner, WWE's Darren Young, UFC's Liz Carmouche, MMA's Fallon Fox and Major League Soccer's Robbie Rogers.  Of those athletes, Collins made the biggest media splash.  "I think it's great. I'm looking forward to seeing him play," Collins, who plays for the Brooklyn Nets, told ESPN after the draft pick was announced.  The road to football stardom was not an easy one for Sam, who graduated from Missouri in December.  One of eight children, he grew up in Hitchcock, Texas, where he was raised primarily by his mother. At one point, he has said, he lived out of his mother's car and briefly stayed with another family.  Three of Sam's siblings have died, including an older brother he saw die from a gunshot wound. Two of his brothers are serving prison sentences.  Complete coverage: Rams pick Michael Sam  NFL draft winners and losers  CNN's Azadeh Ansari and Phil Gast contributed to this report.

Pretoria, South Africa When security guards arrived at the home of Oscar Pistorius on the night his girlfriend died, the first thing the track star told them was that everything was fine.  That's what Pieter Baba, a security guard supervisor, testified Friday in Pistorius' murder trial.  The athlete said everything was fine, but he was crying, Baba said, and he knew everything was not fine.  Baba and the other guards then witnessed Pistorius descending from the upstairs carrying Reeva Steenkamp to the lower level.  "I was so shocked, I couldn't think for a few moments," Baba testified.  Pistorius pleaded not guilty Monday to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp's killing on Valentine's Day 2013 as well as two gun indictments unrelated to her death. Pistorius, 27, nicknamed "Blade Runner," has admitted killing his 29-year-old girlfriend, but says it was a tragic error after he mistook her for an intruder.  Of the witnesses called so far, Baba was the earliest to arrive on the scene. He revealed new details and seemed anxious.  The trial was adjourned until Monday when the defense will continue cross-examination. The defense said it would show that Pistorius called security that night.  Another witness who testified Friday, former Pistorius girlfriend Samantha Taylor, said their relationship ended when he cheated on her with Steenkamp.  Taylor also testified that Pistorius slept with a pistol on his bedside table or on the floor beside his prosthetic legs and once became so angry after a traffic stop that he shot a gun through the sunroof of a car.  Taylor said she met Pistorius in 2010, when she was 17, and they started dating the following year. She said they broke up twice, the second time on November 4, 2012, after he took Steenkamp to a sports banquet.  Defense attorney Barry Roux asked if Taylor admitted in two e-mails to cheating on Pistorius. Taylor says she's never admitted to cheating on him but admits she had a relationship with another man after they broke up the first time.  Roux also asked Taylor for details about the time he supposedly shot the gun out of a car sunroof, but Taylor could not remember the name of the highway or the location in South Africa.  Taylor testified that Pistorius was angry and irritated after the traffic stop, even though he was not driving. She said he joked around about firing a shot and then laughed after he fired.  Prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked Taylor if she was ever at Pistorius' house and he thought there was an intruder. Taylor said yes.  Taylor said Pistorius once heard something hit the bathroom window and woke her up to ask if she'd heard it, too. Taylor said Pistorius woke her up other times when he thought he'd heard a noise.  Live blog: Latest developments in Pistorius trial  Doctor back on the stand  Friday was the fifth day of the Pistorius murder trial, with the defense trying to chip away at testimony of a neighbor who rushed to the track star's home the night he shot Steenkamp.  Roux pointed out that Johan Stipp, a doctor who lived near Pistorius and the first to arrive at the scene, made two statements to police and both times said he heard "two or three shots."  "You could not be sure of the number of noises you heard," Roux said.  "It would be fair to say that," Stipp said on his second day of testimony.  Roux also asked Stipp about screams he heard. Stipp said Thursday the man's screaming came from "much more to the left" of the initial screams. On Friday, Stipp said the screams came "slightly from the left."  Pistorius broke down in court Thursday as Stipp said he went to Pistorius' residence after hearing the shots. He said he saw Steenkamp lying on the floor, her brain tissue mixed with blood and Pistorius praying for her to live.  "I remember the first thing he said when I got there was, 'I shot her, I thought she was a burglar and I shot her,' " Stipp told the court in Pretoria.  And although Stipp is a prosecution witness, his testimony may bolster the defense case, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said after Thursday's dramatic testimony.  Prosecutors appear to have been trying to demonstrate that Pistorius and Steenkamp had a loud argument before the shooting, suggesting it's the reason he killed her.  But the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was Steenkamp screaming in fear for her life was in fact Pistorius when he realized what he had done.  Pistorius and at least two neighbors made phone calls to security after the shooting, allowing the defense to use phone records to establish a timeline of events.  Stipp's version of events appears to coincide with the defense case, said Phelps, who teaches law at the University of Cape Town.  Attorney: Steenkamp could not have screamed  Stipp on Thursday described the grisly scenes when he tried to save the athlete's girlfriend after the fatal shooting.  He said he had arrived and found Steenkamp's body lying at the bottom of the stairs. Pistorius was bent over her body with his left hand over her right groin and two fingers of his right hand in her mouth as he tried to clear her airway.  Stipp tried to assist and said he found no signs of a pulse in her neck, no peripheral pulse and no breathing movements.  As the doctor described the details of her injuries to the court, Pistorius broke down with his head in his hands. He was also seen convulsing but then recovered and wiped his face and nose with a handkerchief.  Stipp, who said he had trained in the army with assault rifles and 9 mm pistolsthe type of pistol that killed Steenkampsaid he had been surprised to hear no ambulance had been called when he arrived. He left after one arrived.  The doctor was later cross-examined by defense attorney Roux, who said Steenkamp could not have been the one screaming at the time Stipp heard the cries of a woman out of her mind with fear.  Roux had consulted three specialists and the autopsy and asked Stipp: "That person after the shots would not have been able to scream. That person would be nonresponsive; does that make sense to you as a medical doctor?"  "It does," Stipp replied.  The prosecution interjected, saying Steenkamp could have screamed after the first shot. Earlier in the week, Nel, the prosecutor, reading a report from an expert, told the court that of the four bullets fired toward Steenkamp "the fourth bullet hit her in the head. She then died."  Pistorius sat impassively during the exchange between Roux and Stipp. He leaned forward, his head down in his hand, as his attorney asked Stipp if the athlete had wanted Steenkamp to live.  "He definitely wanted her to live, yes," Stipp replied. "He looked sincere to me. He was crying; there were tears on his face."  After the court later adjourned, Pistorius was in tears as his sister consoled him. She wrapped an arm around his shoulders and held him close while the room emptied out Thursday.  Trial may last three weeks  The defense only has to show that there is reasonable doubt Pistorius intentionally killed Steenkamp.  Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa will decide whether Pistorius is innocent or guilty. South Africa does not have jury trials.  Earlier in the week, lawyers briefly detoured into another of the four charges Pistorius faces, related to the discharge of a gun he was holding in a crowded restaurant in Johannesburg about a month before the killing.  The trial is expected to take at least three weeks.  In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence, with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for the firearms charge.  If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence, and could be looking at up to 15 years on that charge, experts said.  Pistorius is not claiming self-defense; he is claiming to have been mistaken about his need for self-defense. He is denying he intentionally, unlawfully killed Steenkamp. He has never denied killing her.  Pistorius and Steenkamp were a young, attractive, high-profile couple popular in South Africa's social circles.  Pistorius, whose "Blade Runner" nickname reflects the special prostheses he uses while running, won six Paralympic gold medals and became the first double-amputee runner to compete in the Olympics, in London in 2012.  Cover girl Steenkamp, who was soon to star in a TV reality show, was on the cusp of becoming a celebrity in her own right at the time of her death.  CNN's Nic Robertson and Robyn Curnow in Pretoria and Emily Smith in Atlanta contributed to this report.

	 'Oprah.com: Read the prologue "Little Bee" by Chris C'
This time of year, I am disturbed at the number of curveballs we see being thrown during the Little League World Series.  I coached youth baseball for eight years, each spring and fall. Three years ago, I wrote that Little League Baseball should ban the use of the curveball by its young pitchers.  The evidence seemed clearand sports injury doctors seemed to all agreethat pitchers who were 13 and younger were not physically capable of handling the torque and strain on the elbow when throwing a curveball. The ulnar collateral ligaments connecting the lower and upper part of an arm simply couldn't survive the strain, they said.  Now, there is evidence the curveball may not be entirely to blame. But there is still debate over whether it should be allowed at such a young age.  Little League and others did separate studiesand got somewhat similar results showing that injuries can result not just from throwing curveballs, but from kids throwing too much, with too little rest between pitching appearances.  Little League instituted strict pitch-count and innings-pitched rules five years ago. But those rules don't apply to non-Little League-sanctioned games.  "The difference now is, kids are playing on a number of travel and showcase teams outside Little League, and they have no such rules," says Lance Auken, vice president of communications for Little League Baseball.  "Travel ball has no rules on pitch count or number of innings pitched. So you now have kids throwing 300 to 400 pitches over a four-day period," he says.  Doctor: 'Don't throw curveballs until you can shave'  Little League Baseball commissioned its study with USA Baseball and the University of North Carolina. More than 1,300 pitchers of all ages were examined. For the Little League age group, 409 pitchers were analyzed, looking for which factors influenced injury risk.  "What was causing arm problems was not the curve ball, but the overuse of the arm. It found no evidence to say breaking pitches caused no more injuries than any others," says Auken.  Meanwhile, a group of doctors including Dr. James Andrews, the country's leading doctor in sports arm surgeries, conducted their own study. Andrews specializes in "Tommy John" surgery, which reconstructs the ulnar collateral ligament and is named after a former Major League pitcher.  Andrews and his team at the American Sports Medicine Institute did their study in a laboratory, not on a field. And they found throwing a curveball enacts no more force on the arm than a fastball.  But, they say, throwing curveballs early can lead you down a dangerous path later in a baseball career.  "Dr. Andrews still insists, 'Don't throw curveballs until you can shave," Lanier Johnson, Executive Director of ASMI told CNN.  And, he acknowledges, "That was a controlled lab setting. The field of play during a game isn't like that."  "We've tracked Little League games right through the Little League World Series, and as the competition grows, the kids throw curveballs up to 70% of the time," Glenn Fleisig, ASMI's director of research and co-author of the Andrews study, told ESPN The Magazine.  "It's good that Little Leagues have enacted rules on pitch counts, but for say, a kid in the Dominican (Republic), if you see an unusually developed curveball at an early age, who knows the mileage on that arm?"  Johnson says, "The kid who throws all those curve balls in the Little League World Series is a hero. But does he ever get a change to earn a college scholarship or sign a major league contract? Do you want to take a chance on your son or daughter to get a college scholarship? Do you want to be a hero at 13 or 14 but never much else after that?"  Surgery on the rise for young players?  Even though Little League has instituted new pitch count rules, ASMI says Andrews has performed about seven times the number of arm operations on young pitchers that he did 15 years ago.  So why not err on the side of caution and take Andrews' advice?  "(Andrews) himself will say that is an opinion of his, and is not based on any empirical data," Auken says. "There wasn't any evidence in this study. It's a fine distinction between the two."  "Little League has always been the leader in sports safety. We make changes in our sport based on data, not on feelings. We act out of scientific evidence," he says.  However, Andrews' office does agree that kids who pitched while fatigued are 36 times more likely to have serious arm problems.  Some 2.6 million kids play Little League baseball all over the world. Parents often are sizing up the competition for their 10- to 13-year-olds for future high school teams and college scholarships, and believe their kids should play as much as possible to improve their chances.  Little League officials admit too much baseball is not healthy.  "Kids play year-round now," Auken says. "Kids shouldn't be playing year-round in anything. If a parent is making a 10-year-old do that ... it will make them hate the game by the time they are 16 or 17 years old."  Andrews' group isn't alone on its curveball stance.  Dr. Lyle Micheli, director of the Division of Sports Medicine at Children's Hospital Boston, told the Boston Globe in April that he still believes the curveball is best not thrown until a pitcher is at least 14. He also said kids shouldn't attempt to throw a slider, a pitch that puts even more stress on the elbow, until 16.  Don Friend, an Atlanta-based pitching instructor and former scout for the Atlanta Braves and the Boston Red Sox, gave my son the same guidance in years of lessons. My son went on to pitch for NCAA Division III Piedmont College.  Dr. Timothy Kremchek, an Ohio orthopedic surgeon who is the Cincinnati Reds' physician, told the New York Times this spring he performs 150 elbow ligament reconstructions a year.  "Seventy percent of those surgeries are pitchers who haven't hit college yet," Kremchek said. "I ask each one the same question: When did you start throwing curveballs? And they say: 'I was 10. I was 11.' Sometimes, it's 9."  Five years ago, I attended a coaches' clinic at Georgia Tech that included the coaches and trainers of Georgia Tech and the Atlanta Braves.  At the time, Georgia Tech had a team that counted and documented every pitch of the televised Little League World Series. Team members noted an increase in the use of the curveball every season. Andrews appeared in a video message, and all at the clinic agreed no one under 14 should be throwing the curveball.  If you are watching the Little League World Series as a baseball purist, that sweeping hook of the curve can be a thing of beauty.  But take a good look at the kids throwing them now. Chances are, you may not see them throw it or any other pitches without major surgery needed before they reach high school.  So I will ask Little League again: Why not ban the curveball?  
 Lola Wang, a 28-year-old marketing officer in Shanghai, makes a six-hour trip to Shandong province in eastern China to see her parents twice a yearonce during the Lunar New Year and again during the National Day holiday in October.  "I feel like I should visit my parents more but having a job in the financial industry means I have to work long hours and sacrifice some of my personal time for work," Wang, an only child, tells CNN.  Wang's dilemma is faced by many young people in China, where a one-child policy and three decades of economic reforms have accelerated the decline of the traditional extended family.  It's also a matter of concern for China's new leaders as they grapple with the burden of supporting the growing number of elderly people.  New law  A new national law introduced this week requires the offspring of parents older than 60 to visit their parents "frequently" and make sure their financial and spiritual needs are met.  "People are accusing young people of not visiting their parents enough," says Wang, adding she agrees with the aims of the law.  "Admittedly, some of them use their career and long working hours as an excuse. My problems are that I do care about my parents, but I have little vacation and my parents live far away."  According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, China had about 185 million people above the age of 60 at the end of 2011. The figure is expected to surge to 221 million in 2015 and by 2050 a third of China's population will be classed as elderly.  Neglect  The "Law of Protection of Rights and Interests of the Aged" was amended by China's legislature in December after a spate of reports about elderly parents neglected by their children.  In one particularly horrific case in China's eastern Jiangsu province, a local television station reported that a farmer had kept his 100-year-old mother in a pigsty with a 440lb sow.  Chen Shoutian told the station his mother had been happy to live there: "She wants to stay here because she feels it is convenient," he said.  A modest pension and social welfare system, particularly in rural areas, means elderly people are usually dependent on their children for support.  More than a fifth live below the poverty line, according to figures from the National School of Development at Peking University.  Changing values  Although respect for the elderly is still deeply engrained in Chinese society, traditional values like filial piety have been weakened by the country's rush to modernity.  "The traditional family support system is eroding for many reasons and I think the government would like to slow this process down," said Albert Park, the director of the Emerging Markets Institute at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.  The law stipulates that children cannot give up their inheritance rights in attempt to evade their duty to take care of their parents. It adds that children should pay a monthly allowance to their parents if they refuse to take care of them.  The legislation also allows for the elderly to sue their children but does not specify the process or what penalties they might face.  It may also prove difficult to enforce, says Ding Yiyuan from Beijing Yingke Law Firm. He told the Guangzhou Daily newspaper the law fails to qualify the word "frequently." He added that few elderly people were likely to sue their own children.  First case  On Tuesday, XInhua reported that a 77-year-old woman from Jiangsu city of Wuxi sued her daughter for neglecting her. In the first case after the new law came into effect, the local court ruled that her daughter must visit her at least twice a month and provide financial support.  But the law's introduction has proved controversial. Some say it puts too much pressure on those who move away from home for work, study or other opportunities.  Cheng Zhegang, 50, whose only child is studying for a master's degree in the United States, said the law "distorts the parent-child relationship."  He hopes his daughter will head to a big city like Shanghai or Beijing to find a job on graduation and not return to the small town where she grew up.  "I don't want my daughter to have a burden both physically and spiritually," he told CNN.  "For me, my daughter's career is the most important thing. As the parent of an only child, I have spent so much time and money on my daughter's education and now I want her to be successful."

Pope Benedict XVI is expected to meet the Archbishop of Canterbury on Saturday, the first meeting between the religious leaders since a Catholic overture to disaffected Anglicans that some commentators compared to a hostile takeover on Wall Street.  Rowan Williams, the nominal head of the world Anglican Communion, threw down a theological gauntlet to the pope in a highly challenging speech in Rome in the run-up to their meeting.  He laid out a series of questions suggesting that decades of hard-won apparent reconciliation between the Catholic Church and other Christian denominations might have weak foundations.  He also proposed that a truly universal Christian church might have to be structured more like the Anglican Communionwith no central authority laying down the lawthan like the Catholic Church, with the pope on his throne.  "Is there a mechanism in the church that has the clear right to determine for all where the limits of Christian identity might be found?" Williams asked. "Is the integrity of the church ultimately dependent on a single identifiable ministry of unity to which all local ministries are accountable?"  The meeting comes in the wake of a Vatican move that some say will shatter more than 40 years of efforts to reconcile the Catholic and Anglican churches.  The Vatican announced in October that it had worked out a way for Anglicans who are dissatisfied with their church to switch allegiance en masse to Rome.  The process will enable groups of Anglicans to become Catholic and recognize the pope as their leader, yet have parishes that retain Anglican rites, Vatican officials said. The move comes some 450 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England, forerunner of the Anglican Communion.  The number of Anglicans wishing to join the Catholic Church has increased in recent years as the Anglican Church has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy, said Cardinal William Joseph Levada, the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in announcing the move in October.  Williams was said to have been taken by surprise by the move, which critics described as an end run around a long-established Catholic-Anglican dialogue.  "The Catholic Church is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the Holy See from groups of Anglican clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion," Levada said.  Levada said "hundreds" of Anglicans around the world have expressed their desire to join the Catholic Church. Among them are 50 Anglican bishops, said Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia of the Congregation for Divine Worship.  Catholic and Anglican theology and rites are broadly similar, but Anglicans have long allowed priests to marry and have children.  In recent decades, the Anglican Communion has allowed women to become priests. The Episcopal Church, the United States branch of the Anglican Communion, has ordained an openly gay bishop, Gene Robinson, and appears to be on the verge of ordaining more.  Those developments have caused controversy within the communion, with more conservative parishes setting up alternative structures of authority.  Pope Benedict hinted clearly when he last met Williams in Rome almost exactly three years ago to the day that Rome did not look kindly on the Anglican moves.  "Recent developments, especially concerning the ordained ministry and certain moral teachings, have affected not only internal relations within the Anglican Communion but also relations between the Anglican Communion and the Catholic Church," the pope said in November 2006.  "We believe that these matters, which are presently under discussion within the Anglican Communion, are of vital importance to the preaching of the gospel in its integrity, and that your current discussions will shape the future of our relations," he added.  There are about 77 million Anglicans worldwide, and about 1.1 billion Roman Catholics.  
 Islam Mohmand and his two wives have so many children that he sometimes gets confused and needs help to remember all of their names.  They have 20 kids in all but would be happy to bring even more into their small family house.  But population experts in Pakistan, where the Mohmands are from, say families like theirs are fueling a population explosion that is fast becoming the country's most dangerous crisis.  Pakistan's population has grown from around 33 million in 1947 to more than 180 million people in 2012, making it the sixth most populous country in the world. It is also one of the world's poorest, with 60% of Pakistanis living on just $2 per day, according to the World Bank. The majority of the population70%, according to the United Nationsis largely illiterate and resides in rural areas lacking the most basic services.  With only one in five Pakistani women using modern birth control, the United Nations estimates Pakistan will become the world's third most populous country after China and India by 2050.  "I consider the population problem the biggest problem of this country," said Akbar Laghari of Pakistan's Department of Population Welfare. "The future is bleak because of this."  He admitted the government has to share the blame as not enough is done to offer effective family planning services and teach people about birth control.  "We don't have that much mobility, we don't have the resources," he said.  "Because of the political upheavals in the country and frequent changes in government ... they [the government] are not giving it top priority."  With widespread poverty, an energy crisis, woeful public services, and a bloody, resource-draining insurgency, Pakistan can ill afford to see this rapid growth continue.  "Naturally there will be epidemics, there will be warsthere will be fights for food, water and everything," Laghari warned.  "It's a huge concern that we're growing at one of the fastest rates in Asia," said Zeba Sathar, Pakistan country director for the Population Council, a non-profit organization that specializes in public health research in developing countries.  "I think it's an ignored problem. We're brushing it away and I'm afraid we're losing time."  Sathar says many people are unable to make informed decisions because support services such as family planning are lacking. "The poor end up with many children because they don't have access to right kind of information," she said.  "We're doing a lot of research where women say 'we didn't want that many children,' or they wanted to have them later but they just didn't find the services.  "The philosophy is we're not into controlling the number of children. If you can bring up a healthy family with 20 children, kudos to you. It's a question of running out of resources. It's when the 15th one suffers."  But the Mohmand children are already paying the pricethe family can only afford to send four of their offspring to school, the rest have to work to support the family.  A lack of education is not the only challenge. Pakistan is a deeply conservative country, where some view birth control as un-Islamic.  "None of these methods is allowed in Islam," said Maulana Tanveer Alvi, a Muslim cleric. "Whatever is born in the worldanimals, humans, anything livingGod is responsible for their care.  "The process of reproduction will go on until God stops it. Why should a Muslim worry about the increase in population when God has taken responsibility for everyone's care?"  Culturally, many women are often confined to the marital home and deprived of the right to make important decisions such as whether to have a child.  "Women don't always get to choose ... they require permission from their husband or even their mother-in-law," said Laghari.  However, other Muslim countries with similar problems to Pakistan, including Bangladesh and Iran, have introduced measures to curb their growing populations.  Experts say those countries started with the political will to do something and spent a lot of time and resources on family planning efforts.  The World Health Organization (WHO) says government field workers and satellite clinics are the two crucial elements in the campaign in Bangladeshwhich saw its population grow from 75 million when it gained independence in 1971, to more than 142 million currently.  It said thousands of Health and Family Welfare centers have been upgraded nationwide, while Family Welfare Assistants provide door-to-door visits giving millions of couples family planning support and sexual health education.

An Amnesty International report issued Wednesday blasts Shell Oil Co. for its handling of the hundreds of oil spills that occur each year in Nigeria and accuses the company of "serious deficiencies and abuses" that render "wholly unreliable" its claims about how much oil is spilled and how often.  The 80-page report, titled "Bad InformationOil Spills in the Niger Delta," cites corrosion, poor maintenance, equipment failure, sabotage and oil theft as causes of oil spills.  But it challenges the company's assertion that the vast majority of the spills are caused by sabotage and theft.  "There is no legitimate basis for this claim," the report says. "It relies on the outcome of an oil spill investigation processcommonly known as the Joint Investigation Visit or JIV processin which the companies themselves are the primary investigators."  Reliable data about the spills is critical to limiting the harm they can cause to the environment, livelihoods and human health, the report says.  Determining their cause is critical because communities affected by spills blamed on sabotage or theft get no compensation in Nigeria, which is itself a flaw, the report says.  "Oil companies should be held responsible for a spill that is due to sabotage or theft if the operator has failed to take sufficient measures to prevent tampering with its infrastructure," it says.  In response, Shellin a statement sent to CNN by spokesman Ross Whittamsaid: "The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC) firmly rejects unsubstantiated assertions that they have exaggerated the impact of crude oil theft and sabotage to distract attention from operational performance.  "We seek to bring greater transparency and independent oversight to the issue of oil spills, and will continue to find ways to enhance this. These efforts include publishing spill data online since January 2011 and working with Bureau Veritas, an independent third party, to find ways to improve the immediate response to a spill."  The Amnesty report acknowledges improvements since 2011, but says "serious flaws remain" in the company's oil spill investigation process.  "These include weaknesses in the underlying evidence used to attribute spills to sabotage and the fact that the JIV reports are filled out by Shell after the joint investigation processnot as part of the joint investigation process. There is, consequently, a lack of transparency and oversight in terms of what is recorded on the new JIV reports."  But Shell said in its statement that SPDC cannot control the joint investigation process, since it involves representatives of regulatory bodies, the Ministry of Environment, the Nigerian Police Force, the state government and affected communities.  The company cited a recent report from Britain's Chatham House that said an average of 100,000 barrels of oil were stolen each day in the first quarter of this year.  "Coordinated action from the industry, government, security forces, civil society and others is needed to end this criminality, which remains the main cause of oil pollution in the Delta today," it said. "SPDC regrets that some NGOs continue to take a campaigning approach rather than focusing on on-the-ground solutions that bring societal benefits."  Audrey Gaughran, director of global issues for Amnesty in London, rejected the company's characterization of the report's claims as "unsubstantiated."  "The assertions are very well substantiated in the report," she said in a telephone interview. "We've taken the process down step by step, with expert advice, and provided individual cases, and all of this was provided to Shell beforehand to seek responses, and we got no responses to anything."  She also disputed the company's description of Bureau Veritas as independent. "Bureau Veritas is hired by Shell," she said.  And she said the Chatham House report is irrelevant. "Yes, it documents significant theft," which is a serious issue, she said. But, she added, "Theft is not oil spills. Proving there's loads of theft doesn't prove there's lots of oil spills due to the theft."  
 COVINGTON, Louisiana A woman recruited over the Internet and shot to death during a Ku Klux Klan group's initiation rite felt a need to be wanted and was eager to be part of a group, authorities say family members told them.  Relatives describe Cynthia Lynch as having a deep need to feel wanted and eager to join groups.  Her relatives told investigators that Cynthia Lynch, 43, of Tulsa, Oklahoma, had never been outside her home state, said Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Department.  But she recently took a bus to Slidell, Louisiana, where she was met by two Klan members and taken to a campsite in the woods near Sun, Louisiana, about 60 miles north of New Orleans.  Bonnett and Sheriff Jack Strain gave CNN this account of what happened:  During the initiation rite, members of the Klan group, which calls itself the Sons of Dixie, shaved Lynch's head. After 24 hours of drills, including chanting and running with torches, she asked to be taken to town. An argument began and the group's leader, Chuck Foster, allegedly pushed her to the ground and shot her to death without warning.  Lynch wanted to leave the campsite because she was homesick, investigators concluded after talking to Lynch's family in Tulsa.  Watch how an initiation rite went wrong   Strain told CNN that Foster used a knife to remove the bullet. Other members of the Sons of Dixie helped cover up the slaying for Foster, their leader or "Grand Lordship," Strain added. The attempt to conceal the killing included burning the woman's personal items, Strain said.  The new details emerged Thursday as the FBI announced it was assisting local authorities.  The FBI's top agent in New Orleans, Louisiana, said the agency usually doesn't monitor specific groups, but will look into whether any federal laws were violated.  "The FBI is working closely with local law enforcement authorities investigating this recent incident," said Special Agent in Charge David W. Welker. He added that the FBI would "aggressively investigate" any leads and urged anyone with information to call the FBI at  504-816-3000  Sheriff's investigators said they received the intitial tip about the killing from a convenience store clerk. Two of the group members went into the store and asked the clerk if he knew how to get bloodstains out of their clothes, Strain said. The clerk told them no, and called the sheriff after they left.  Officials tracked down those two members and arrested them. Authorities established telephone contact with other members of the group who were still at the campsite and let them know law enforcement officials were on their way. They surrendered without incident.  Foster was elsewhere in the woods, but he also surrendered, the sheriff said.  Watch report on Klan initiation gone awry   The woman's body was found under loose brush along a road several miles from the campsite. At the campsite, investigators found Confederate flags, KKK banners, five Klan robes and an Imperial Wizard robe.  Foster, 44, is charged with second-degree murder. He remained Thursday at the St. Tammany Parish jail with no bail set, authorities said.  Seven other suspects also remained in jail Thursday, charged with obstruction of justice. Bail for each was set at $500,000.  On Wednesday, sheriff's investigators searched a house Foster had rented for the past five years in Bogalusa. They found Klan paraphernalia, documents and computer files. Among the seized documents were membership applications, titles and a chain of command for group members  "We recovered various documents out of that home that are giving us an indication of the organizational structure and the organizational guidelines of the group," Bonnett said.  Fred Oswold, chief of criminal investigations for the sheriff's office, said the Sons of Dixie Klan group is small and that most of its members already had been arrested.  "So far we have learned that they were a small group, but they were fairly organized," said Oswold, who said his agency is working with the FBI to learn more about the group.  CNN's Katie Ross contributed to this report.

A Swedish citizen of Rwandan origin was sentenced to life in prison Thursday by a court in Stockholm after he was tried and convicted for his role in the country's genocide nearly 20 years ago.  He is 54-year-old Stanislas Mbanenande, an ethnic Hutu. At least 800,000 people in Rwanda were killed in the 1994 genocide, one of the worst mass slaughters in the post-World War II era.  Genocide survivor has faith in future of Rwanda  This is the first time that Sweden has tried a case for genocide, and also the first time anyone has been convicted of genocide in a Swedish court.  The victims were mostly from the Tutsi ethnic minority, who were targeted by Hutus over a rivalry that dates to colonial days. Some moderates from the Hutu majority who supported Tutsis also were killed.  Along with a charge of genocide, Mbanenande was convicted in the Stockholm District Court of gross violations of international law, including murder, attempted murder, inciting murder and kidnapping.  The case involves several massacres in western Rwanda's Kibuye prefecture, where Mbanenande was born and raised.  Mbanenande was accused of having an informal leadership role and using an automatic weapon to shoot at groups of people. He took part in massacres at public buildings such as a church, a school and a sports stadium where people sought shelter.  He also is accused of taking part in the hunt for Tutsis in the Ruhiro and Bisesero mountains where people had fled to seek safety.  Mbanenande left Kibuye in 1994 when Tutsi-dominated invasion troops were nearing. He then lived in Congo until 1996, and then he moved to the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.  In 1999 his family moved to Sweden. Mbanenande eventually joined them and became a Swedish citizen in 2008.  
 New York The family of a 7-year-old Bronx boy is suing the city of New York and its police force for $250 million, claiming the child was falsely arrested and handcuffed over a $5 theft.  After being accused of stealing the money from a fellow student in November, the parents say, the boy was taken out of his third-grade class in the Bronx and detained by authorities.  The family filed the suit last week, but the incident came into the spotlight early Wednesday in New York when the boy's mother released a photo of the boy being handcuffed.  The court filing says the child was handcuffed by police, held for 10 hours and charged with two counts of robbery that were later dropped.  But the New York Police Department disputes those allegations, saying the claims are exaggerated.  "We're barred from discussing details involving a minor, but that doesn't stop a plaintiff's lawyer from exploiting a child and grossly distorting and fabricating 'facts,'" said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne.  Police said they have referred the case to Internal Affairs for further review.  The New York City Department of Education declined to comment because the incident did not occur on school grounds.  Police handcuff 6-year-old student in Georgia

Rhinebeck, New York Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton and longtime beau Marc Mezvinsky were wed Saturday "in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts," a 50-acre estate in Rhinebeck, New York, according to her parents.  "We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family," former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement. "On behalf of the newlyweds, we want to give special thanks to the people of Rhinebeck for welcoming us and to everyone for their well-wishes on this special day."  The confirmation by the Clintons put to rest a slew of speculation on where and when the nuptials would take place.  "Today, we watched with great pride and overwhelming emotion as Chelsea and Marc wed in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts, surrounded by family and their close friends," the statement said.  The interfaith ceremonyClinton is Methodist and Mezvinsky is Jewishwas led by Rabbi James Ponet and the Rev. William Shillady, the family said. The groom wore a tallit, or prayer shawl, and a yarmulke.  A friend of the couple read the Leo Marks poem "The Life That I Have," according to the family.  The brideas predictedwore a dress designed by Vera Wang, the family said.  The strapless dress had a swirling silk organza ball skirt and train, and was accented by an embellished belt.  Clinton had been spotted by Women's Wear Daily outside the designer's showroom in New York earlier this week, and Wang was spotted in Rhinebeck on Saturday.  Hillary Clinton wore a pink gown by Oscar de la Renta, the family said.  Jim Valli and his band performed at the reception, and the couple's good friend, Tim Blane, played at the rehearsal dinner, according to the Clinton family. The reception was catered by The St. Regis, the rehearsal dinner by Blue Ribbon.  Hundreds of curious onlookersalong with hordes of reporters and cameramengathered Saturday at the main intersection of the tiny New York town in hopes of catching a glimpse of celebrities and dignitaries attending the wedding.  Well-heeled wedding guests wearing floor-length gowns and tuxedos were seen boarding shuttles to take them to what one event planner billed as "the wedding of the century."  Storefront windows displayed signs reading "Congratulations Marc & Chelsea" and similar messages.  "You could make a case that this is the most significant thing to happen in Rhinebeck since Washington's army drove the British out of Rhinebeck back in the 1700s," said Jim Langon, editor of the Hudson Valley News newspaper, who was the first to report that the wedding would take place there.  Bill and Hillary Clinton were seen arriving at a formal dinner at the Beekman Arms Inn in Rhinebeck on Friday night.  Also attending were former Secretary of State Madeleine Albrightwho was spotted lunching in town before the wedding Saturday, presidential adviser Vernon Jordan and numerous young couples presumed to be friends of the bride and groom.  Actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgenlongtime married friends of the Clinton familytold CNN that despite the public spectacle of the wedding, "it's been a very personal experience for them."  "There's been so much love and tenderness around the whole thing," Steenburgen said. "That kind of gets obscured a little bit when you're talking about someone that's a public person. But on the inside of it I can tell you that it's been very much like everybody's weddingfull of tenderness and memories and laughter."  Some wedding planners had speculated that the cost of the celebration could run to seven or even eight figures, but a longtime Clinton family friend said the cost would be less than $1 million.  Mezvinsky, a 32-year-old investment banker, is the son of former U.S. Reps. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky of Pennsylvania and Ed Mezvinsky of Iowa.  When Bill Clinton was seen in Rhinebeck earlier this week, someone asked him if his daughter was going to look beautiful on Saturday.  "She looks beautiful every day to me," the beaming father said.  Earlier in July, Hillary Clinton told Polish media that she was enjoying taking part in her daughter's wedding planning.  "It's a very happy time for my family," she said. "It truly is the most important thing in my life right now."  Steenburgen, who told CNN that she has known the Clintons for 30 years, predicted tears from the former president by the end of the night.  "Knowing my friend Bill ... I can honestly tell you that I'm sure he'll be crying his eyes out," she said.  CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.  
 While lying on a thin mattress a few months ago, nursing the symptoms of dengue fever, I watched a huntsman spider leap off of the wall of my wooden shack and onto a hapless cockroach, which the spider dragged away and devoured.  I was serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in the rural eastern part of the Dominican Republic. But the spider's ambushwhich gave new meaning to the word "insecticide"brought me back to another remote corner of the globe, Afghanistan, where I had served in my other beloved corps: the Marine Corps.  Ambushesby Taliban insurgents rather than hairy spiderswere regular occurrences in southern Afghanistan. As a Marine officer, I made two deployments there, the second of which was spent testing, distributing, and fine-tuning equipment designed to foil the remote-control bombs the Taliban used to ambush us.  Then, in 2011, my active service ended, I turned in my rifle and I joined the Peace Corps, where I spent two years building composting latrines in Dominican communities that lacked access to basic sanitation. I completed my service this month and returned to the United States (I got over the dengue fever just fine).  When you join the Marine Corps or the Peace Corps, much less both, you often have some explaining to do. So, on this Memorial Day, permit me to reflect here on the reasons people serve and to describe some of the common threads between these two special American institutions.  You might be surprised to hear that the goals of the Marines and the Peace Corps, and the ideals of the volunteers who join them, overlap. You might also be surprised to learn that the Peace Corps has its own legacy of sacrifice, with more of its volunteers killed on the job than Central Intelligence Agency officers.  Marines operate as a team, in a strictly defined hierarchy. Peace Corps service is largely an individual effort, and volunteers can go for months without being heard from by staff. Peace Corps training includes learning to teach kids simple science experiments. Marine Corps training includes learning the proper technique for choking someone to death.  The essence of the Peace Corps mission is to promote understanding between American volunteers and the people they serve. The Marine Corps mission is to win our nation's battles.  But to say the two organizations are opposites would be erroneous. The book that inspired President John F. Kennedy to launch the Peace Corps was the 1958 novel called "The Ugly American." I was actually assigned to read it by the Marine Corps, since its practical advice on quelling insurgencies was correctly deemed relevant to the counterinsurgency wars we were now fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I saw Marines approach problems in Afghanistan as though they were characters in that novelor Peace Corps volunteers. Rolando, a young infantryman in our area of responsibility, won over local farmers by spontaneously shedding his equipment and helping them dig irrigation ditches one day while on patrol. Rolando, who'd taught himself Pashto using an MP3 player, chatted amiably with the local men he encountered. The respect he showed them helped to win their support in our fight against the Taliban.  While nation-building under fire certainly isn't a Peace Corps mission, I saw enterprising Peace Corps volunteers make a deep impact on the communities where they were invited to serve. Dory was assigned to work on a waste-management project in a Dominican migrant farm worker community. It soon became apparent to her that this project would fail.  Rather than move to a different community or continue slaving on a doomed effort, she identified a more serious problem that she wouldn't have seen if she hadn't gotten to know this community in the first place.  Numerous locally born kids were refused access to education because of their Haitian descent, denied a basic right that they were legally owed. Dory learned to help people negotiate a discriminatory government bureaucracy, ultimately winning documentation for dozens of community members and helping them achieve access to public high schools and a shot at a better living.  The Marines and Peace Corps volunteers with whom I served demonstrated more ingenuity, perseverance, and guts than any other group of people I've known. They also possessed a surplus of something that is vanishing from many other parts of American life: humility.  Countless Marines I know had put off careers in business, finance and law to play small, almost anonymous parts in tedious and dangerous places. Sometimes the greatest personal achievement was looking out for fellow Marines by training them extra hard or jolting them from their sense of complacency in the final weeks of a deployment.  Those sorts of achievements don't always make for sexy copy on a resume, but they are the achievements that can be savored the longest because they resulted in lives saved.  Similarly, many of the Peace Corps volunteers I served with gave up good jobsas engineers, teachers, IT professionalsto leave home for a couple of years and find the enduring fulfillment that comes from leaving your comfort zone and improving the lives of strangers you have grown to know better than your neighbors back home.  While nothing compares to the risks our servicemen and women take in combat, the Peace Corps isn't exactly a walk to the local playground. Since its inception in 1961, the Peace Corps has lost at least 287 volunteers to disease, road accidents, crime, and other hazards in their host countries. That's more than twice the number of fallen CIA officers, whose sacrifices are properly commemorated by stars etched into Memorial Wall inside their headquarters.  Kennedy, shortly after taking office, spoke of an "immense reservoir" of American men and women "anxious to sacrifice their energies and time and toil to the cause of world peace and human progress."  To see many of the best people from that reservoirthe ones who stopped dreaming of their potential to serve and took real actiontake a look at those volunteers in the Marines and the Peace Corps. I really believe you can find the best of Americas youth serving in each of these organizations. And neither organization squanders that resource.

Marco Rubio is all in.  The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream.  With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.  He holds little appeal to Latino voters.  And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep.  Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate "Gang of 8" that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.  He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border.  His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.  That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters.  Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.   He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended.  He has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, on hold pending a circuit court review, sets a "horrifying precedent."  Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.  No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, "We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally."  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken.  At a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against "one candidate in the race who's from yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday."  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.  Over the weekend, he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous.  He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States.  Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice.  Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do a majority of Cuban-Americans.  By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership.  Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.  He is a fierce opponent of "Obamacare" and wants the law repealed.  However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12.3% drop in the Hispanic uninsured rate, making Latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance, thanks to the law.  (In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for "Obamacare" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.)  Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.  And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.  Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.  But his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding, Rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate.  In February, he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website Politico.  Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.  Consider that his fellow contender for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana.  Or that another GOP candidate for president, Sen. Ted Cruz  of Texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand.  By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters.  With his early leap into the 2016 race, Marco Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership.  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combinationnot for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.  
 England has banned smoking in cars where children are presenta law that will come into force from October 1, with offenders facing a fine of 50 ($77).  The law states that it will be an offence to smoke in a private vehicle with someone under age 18 in the car, and to fail to prevent smoking under the same circumstances.  The legislation applies to enclosed, private vehicles but not to anyone driving alone.  "Three million children are exposed to second-hand smoke in cars, putting their health at risk," the Public Health Minister Jane Ellis said.  "We know that many of them feel embarrassed or frightened to ask adults to stop smoking, which is why the regulations are an important step in protecting children from the harms of second-hand smoke."  The British Lung Foundation said more than 80% of second-hand smoke contains cancer-causing toxins, which are more concentrated in the confines of a car.  Children are more susceptible to the harmful effects because their lungs are smaller, they breathe faster and have less developed immune systems.  Wales introduced a similar ban last year and the law is in addition to the prohibition of smoking in workplaces and enclosed public places, which was enforced in England in July 2007.  The ban also exists in a number of jurisdictions in Canada, the United States and Australia, while other countries are considering the move.  South Africa and Bahrain do not allow smoking in cars with children present and Mauritius has banned smoking in all cars carrying any passenger.  The British Heart Foundation welcomes the regulation as well as future plans to discourage young smokers.  "Parliament will shortly vote on introducing standardised packaginga key measure in helping to stop children from smoking," said Chief Executive Simon Gillespie.  "By ridding cigarette products of their distinctive designs we'll reduce the appeal of this uniquely lethal product damaging the heart health of future generations."  Mixed views are being expressed on Twitter.

Veteran Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar will retire at the end of this season, according to his Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.  Earlier this month United confirmed the signing of Anders Lindegaard from Aalesunds FK, and Ferguson has now admitted the 26-year-old Dane is likely to replace van der Sar as the English club's No. 1 next season.  "We are planning for this being Edwin's last season. But even if he finishes as a player, he might stay at the club because of his knowledge and standing in the game," Ferguson told reporters on Thursday.  Lindegaard has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee and he will be formally registered in the January transfer window.  Ferguson added: "He is training with us now and that is important. It will bring him to a better level of fitness because he has not played for a few weeks. We will see how his progress goes."  Meanwhile, Aston Villa manager Gerard Houllier has confirmed he will decide on the future of veteran American goalkeeper Brad Friedel in February.  The 39-year-old Friedel is close to becoming the oldest player to ever appear for the Premier League club, but his contract expires at the end of the season and Houllier has admitted he is looking for a new custodian.  "We are looking at several goalkeepers and we've told Brad we are looking for a keeper for the future," the Frenchman told reporters on Thursday.  "If Brad is fine in February, then we will keep him. We've told him that, if he feels OK."  
 The Beach Boys were all smiles this week when they unveiled their exhibit at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles.  Earlier this year, they put aside their differences to reunite in a very public way: on-stage at "The 54th Annual Grammy Awards." That was followed by the release of their first album of new material in 20 years, and an extensive worldwide tour to celebrate their 50th anniversary.  All five membersBrian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston and David Marksseemed genuinely excited when talking about their reunion.  "The value of the music is so good," Love said. "Good vibrations, you might say."  But good vibrations may now be a thing of the past. Just before the Grammy Museum celebration, Love and Johnston issued a press release announcing they would be hitting the road with their own incarnation of the Beach Boys. According to the tersely worded statement, "The post-50th anniversary configuration will not include Brian Wilson, Al Jardine and David Marks. The 50th Reunion Tour was designed to be a set tour with a beginning and an end to mark a special 50-year milestone for the band."  A blindsided Wilson said, "I'm disappointed and can't understand why he (Love) doesn't want to tour with Al, David and me. We are out here having so much fun. After all, we are the real Beach Boys."  The Brian Wilson-Mike Love version of the Beach Boys has just arrived in London for the final two dates of their reunion tour. If the splintered Beach Boy factions can't come to an agreement about their future, the September 28 concert at Wembley Stadium may be the last we see of this particular lineup.  Wilson has said he'd like his next project to be a rock 'n' roll album. Right now, he doesn't know who he'll be working with on the record, but adds that he'd like it to be the Beach Boys.  50 years of teen bliss: Serenaded by the Beach Boys

As royalty from different parts of the world converged on the Netherlands to watch the monarchy change hands, some of the guests there may have been thinking ahead to the day when they get the top job back home.  In Europe, most monarchs are getting old and have been on their thrones for years. Their offspring are grown up and are now waiting in the wings to take their respective crowns.  Britain's Prince Charles was in Amsterdam to watch Queen Beatrix hand over to her 46-year-old son Willem-Alexander. He was also in the Netherlands when Beatrix herself took the throne from her mother 33 years ago on Queen Juliana's abdication. Charles's new Dutch counterpart is Amalia, The Princess of Orange, who is nine.  Was Charles wondering when his turn would come? Perhaps, but that of course would involve the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. One thing is for surehis 61-year wait as heir to the throne won't end with the abdication of his mother.  To the British royals, the word "abdication" brings back painful memories of the 1936 crisis when King Edward VIII was forced to relinquish his throne so he could marry the divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson and relinquished his throne. Queen Elizabeth will never abdicate. The other long-serving European Queen, Margrethe of Denmark also sees it as a job for life.  However, both Margrethe and Elizabeth are handing more responsibilities to their heirs. One option might be for them to appoint their sons Princes Regent which would mean they would be in charge of royal duties while their mothers kept the title.  Crown princes and princesses across Europe look ready to take on the task of modern-day monarchy with all the burdens that some believe can only be carried by younger royals.  Opinion: Dutch monarchs teach world's royalty  In Spain, 75-year-old year old King Juan Carlos's popularity has waned. And that's led to suggestions, even among monarchists, that his heir, Crown Prince Felipe and his wife Letizia take over the throne.  In Sweden, King Carl Gustaf is 67. He's been on the throne for 40 years and has recently been scandalized in the press. His heir, Crown Princess Victoria is married to Prince Daniel and has a baby daughter, Princess Estelle, as the next two generations there take shape.  And over in Norway, King Harald is in his mid-70s with an heir who will be 40 in July. Crown Prince Haakon is married to Princess Mette-Marit. The couple have had two children.  iReport: Happy crowds applaud new king  All of these heirs also have something in common that makes them appealing to a modern, more relaxed generation. They have all married outside the aristocracy, making them more accessible and relevant to younger subjects.  But while the precedent of abdication has set in the Netherlands, it hasn't yet taken hold elsewhere. However, in an age when the pope resigns, don't be surprised if other older royals take some sort of cue from Beatrix.  
 Thursday, the White House revealed its efforts to reform the patent system, following up on President Obama's call in the State of the Union address.  The White House called on Congress to pass legislation to combat patent trolls, known less pejoratively as "patent assertion entities." PAE's are firms that don't manufacture anything. They buy patents and threaten to sue people to extract licensing fees, like the mythical troll charging a fee to cross a bridge. Apple, Google and AT&T have each faced more than 100 such suits since 2009.  Critics suggest that trolls create a drag on innovation by diverting resources to litigation.  In response, the House of Representatives passed the Innovation Act of 2013 in December. The Senate is considering various anti-troll bills. Even the Supreme Court has gotten into the act, hearing cases this term that relate to the troll issue.  If all three branches of government are reacting to trolls, clearly they are a huge problem.  Except, they aren't. What is lost in this mudslinging is that much of what PAEs do is laudable  paying inventors. Patents don't grow on trees. Someone came up with the invention and incurred considerable expense to obtain the patent. Many inventors can't bring their invention to market themselves, however, so selling the patent may be the only way for them to make money. By buying these patents, PAEs compensate inventors, one of patent law's objectives.  Patents give their owners the right to seek compensation for unauthorized uses of the invention, so there is nothing wrong with a PAE enforcing a valid patent.  The key word, though, is valid. Problems arise when PAEs sue on improperly issued patents, ones that never should have gotten out of the US Patent and Trademark Office.  For example, many patents on software and business methodsareas where PAEs often operateare not sufficiently different from earlier technology to justify the patent, or are too vague to discern what they legitimately cover. Even though companies can knock these patents out in court, most parties settle. But, if they aren't legitimate patents, why do parties settle? Simple: to avoid the expense.  According to a 2013 American Intellectual Property Law Association survey, median litigation costs are $3.3 million when $10 million to $25 million is at stake. Discoverythe process of looking for evidence relevant to the case --is responsible for much of the expense. Defendants must wade through voluminous records and e-mails to find anything relevant to the case. For a case worth $10 million to $25 million, the survey estimates that the median cost through discovery in defending a PAE suit is $1.5 million.  A PAE doesn't face these expenses. Discovery is easy for it because all it has is the patent. Plus, its lawyers usually take these cases on contingency, taking a percentage of whatever money they bring in, so there are no upfront attorney costs. When manufacturing companies face these costs, many simply settle, leaving the invalid patent in place.  But these are not troll problems; they are litigation and patent quality issues. Scapegoating trolls risks disrupting the useful compensatory purpose they serve and may cause unintended consequences in non-troll litigation.  Unfortunately much of the Innovation Act's proposals are ill-considered from this perspective. For example, the act makes all patent litigationtroll and non-trolla "loser pays" system. The losing party must pay the attorney fees of the other side unless the loser's case was "reasonably justified." So, if a PAE sues on a bad patent and loses, it may have to pay the company's attorney fees. By having more skin in the game, hopefully PAEs would think twice about asserting bad patents.  Unfortunately, the provision applies to all patent cases, likely increasing litigation expenses in all cases as parties fight over feesworrisome and chilling the willingness of non-trolls, such as startups, to enforce their patents.  Such legislation is premature because two of the troll-related cases at the Supreme Court deal precisely with this issue. Other provisions in the act attempt to reduce litigation expenses, but they inappropriately micromanage the federal courts.  Patent quality concerns must be addressed by the patent office. Unfortunately, the relevant provisions of the Innovation Act were removed prior to passage, so the final version contains no provisions relating to patent office procedures.  The President's proposals, however, are directed to improving the quality of the patent office's review of patent applications. If successful, enhancing the clarity of what a patent covers would be a welcome improvement. The patent office's efforts to create greater transparency of patent ownership is also important because PAEs often hide their ownership behind various corporate shells.  Finally, in 2011, Congress created new procedures to challenge patents after the patent office has issued them. Time will tell whether they successfully enhance patent quality, yet the promise is there.  But all three branches must remember that not all patent trolls are demons. PAEs create markets for compensating inventors. Patent reform efforts should not myopically focus on trolls per se, or it may disrupt these markets and create other unintended consequences.  Reform must address patent quality and exorbitant litigation costs. The President's proposals offer hope, but the Innovation Act's efforts are misplaced. The Senate proposals are more modest. Let's hope Congress pauses to consider the broader role PAEs play in our economy and appropriately tailors legislation to the patent system's real problems.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Holbrook.

There's a devastating narrative being told about the PC these days: It's dying.  It's not a slow death either. Sales of traditional PCs are collapsing faster than anyone expected.  And this isn't just some vague perception from the anti-Microsoft crowd. This is backed up with real data, most notably in the latest IDC report released this month that says PC sales are down 14% year over year.  The entire market appears to be imploding, and it doesn't just apply to PCs running Windows. Even Apple's Mac computer sales are basically flat year over year, yet its iPad business continues to grow.  So what's going on here? Why aren't people buying regular laptops and desktops anymore?  There are a ton of theories floating around out there, but the consensus seems to be that PC makers still haven't figured out how to leverage the transition into mobile devices.  Perhaps the biggest blame falls on Microsoft. It made a huge gamble with the introduction of Windows 8, a radically different kind of operating system designed primarly for touchscreen devices. Windows 8 replaces your traditional desktop screen with a new touch-friendly start menu that has a lot of people confused.  IDC's report sums it up nicely:  "While some consumers appreciate the new form factors and touch capabilities of Windows 8, the radical changes to the UI, removal of the familiar Start button, and the costs associated with touch have made PCs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices. Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market."  It's as if Microsoft is eating itself, trying to catch up with the mobile revolution while still packaging its new operating system in pricey hardware that's clearly declining in popularity with consumers. And because Windows 8 tablets are full PCs with expensive components, people are moving to cheaper tablets like the iPad Mini or ones based on Google's Android operating system.  After all, why buy a brand new expensive computer that's difficult to learn when you can get an easy-to-use tablet that can do most of the same stuff at a fraction of the price?  However, there is a small ray of hope for the Microsoft faithful.  Microsoft is gearing up to release a new version of Windows later this year, codenamed Windows Blue. According to several reports, Blue will give users the option to replace the new start screen with a traditional desktop by default. If the reports are true, it would be a smart move, and one that could help ease the transition into modern mobile computing.  The company is also toying around with the idea of making smaller, cheaper tablets that are much more popular with consumers. Microsoft recently issued a statement to its manufacturing partners that Windows 8 will now support smaller screens in the 7-inch range. Plus there are several reports that Microsoft will add such a tiny tablet to its Surface line of devices. You can expect to see a bunch of similar devices from other manufacturers later this year.  Let's be clear though. This game isn't over yet.  Apple hasn't won. Microsoft and Google haven't either. The personal computing industry has been turned on its head, and everyone is still noodling around with strategies on how to adapt. Even the way we define "PC" is changing, and we're getting to the point where there's almost no distinction between mobile and regular computing.  The PC as we know it may be dying, but the PC as it will be is just getting started.  Copyright  2011 Business Insider.  
 LONDON, EnglandIn his autobiography, Eric Clapton admits that he enjoys nothing more than sitting in a deck chair on a white sandy beach watching his children playing in the sea.  Private getaway: Eric Clapton enjoys spending time relaxing on his superyacht Va Bene.  It's the perfect antidote to a punishing tour schedule, and with gigs in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Scandinavia and Europe so far this year, getting away from it all is an experience he values.  He found that he was particularly at ease aboard the 157 ft (47.8m) motor yacht Va Bene, which he chartered in 2005 and cruised with friends around the Mediterranean. The sheltered port of Bonifacio at the southern end of Corsica became one of his favorite haunts.  In fact, Clapton enjoyed Va Bene so much that he bought her. It was the first time he'd ever had to borrow money to buy something, but he had fallen for the yacht, despite her 13 years and slightly dated looks. Besides there was always the possibility of updating her to give her a new lease of life.  Va Bene came with an interesting pedigree. She had originally been commissioned by a Greek ship owner in 1992 to a design by Richard Hein (of Oceanco fame) and built by Kees Cornelissen in Holland. She was then purchased by F1 motor racing supremo Bernie Ecclestone before being sold to an American. A steel-hulled displacement yacht with a cruising speed of about 14 knots, Va Bene can accommodate 12 guests in six separate sleeping cabins and has a crew complement of 13.  Having lived with Va Bene for a couple of years, Eric Clapton finally felt the time was right for a refit. Clapton was particularly keen for the work to be carried out in the UK, partly because he wanted to buy British but also because he could keep a close eye on proceedings. Pendennis Shipyard in Falmouth, Cornwall, was an obvious choice. Roger Taylor, the drummer with Queen has his yacht Tiger Lilly refitted regularly in Falmouth and Pete Townsend of the Who is another famous client.  Pendennis Shipyard representative Alastair Heane was first introduced to the yacht during the charter show in Antigua in December 2006. Eric Clapton has a house on the island and Va Bene is based here during the winter season. Heane quickly established a detailed proposal of work. The plan was to get Va Bene to Falmouth after Clapton had finished his 2007 summer holiday so that the work could be carried out during the winter.  The initial time frame was three months but like most complex refits this quickly extended to six as the work list grew. The target was to have Va Bene ready and waiting in Porto Cervo Sardinia on July 1 this year in time for Eric Clapton's month-long family holidaya date that was set in stone to fit around his tour schedule.  We caught up with Va Bene during a photo shoot at the end of June 2008 on the very day she was setting sail from Palma, Mallorca, to meet up with the boss in Sardinia. With the final last-minute touches still being applied and the crew busily unpacking everything from the owner's precious guitar to his children's cuddly toys, it was a close run thing but Pendennis had met the deadline in style.  The first thing that strikes you on boarding Va Bene is the calm, informal atmosphere of what is clearly a much-loved family yacht rather than a glitzy monument to success.  Eric Clapton may be one of the world's greatest living rock stars but he is also an unpretentious family man who wants a yacht that he can relax on. The saloon encapsulates this perfectly.  Rather than a single formal space with designer furniture that look so immaculate you hardly dare sit down, Va Bene's saloon is divided into four separate areas with clusters of contrasting chairs, sofas, tables and cabinets. One group of guests can be relaxing round the card table and matching leather chairs, while others stretch out on the big taupe corduroy sofa to watch a movie. That still leaves room for him to sneak off into another corner and perch on one of the special armless low-level chairs to play his guitar.  The adjacent dining room is a little more formal but even here the overriding feeling is of a wonderfully light room centered around what looks like a huge limed-oak table inlaid with Italian marble.  In fact, it is all the handiwork of a talented local artisan who painted the surface of the original table to match the materials found elsewhere on the yacht right down to the fake wooden joints and natural marble flaws. This solution appealed both to Clapton's desire to refresh rather than replace where possible and his appreciation of skilled craftsmanship.  He is a keen collector of modern art himself and every spare wall and surface reflects this passion. From intricate postcard-sized oil paintings of Venice to large, sprawling canvases and some beautiful marble sculptures and ceramic vases, it is a collection that reflects the singer's own ability to transcend the confines of any one genre.  Perhaps that also explains the relatively neutral tones of the dcor. There is an Art Deco theme running through the main guest areas, which the refit has refreshed and modernized rather dispensed with. The limed-oak paneling is original but all the garish gold door handles, light fittings and switches have either been replaced or replated in chrome to give it a much more contemporary feel.  The high gloss white painted ceiling panels and moldings have all been meticulously flatted back to leave a softer matt finish while all the ceiling lights, some 400 of them in total, have been replaced with modern recessed spots.  As you'd expect aboard a musician's yacht, the AV system was another major beneficiary of the refit. Every cabin and guest space now has a discreet Arcam iPod dock so that he can plug in his iPhone wherever he is and enjoy instant access to his personal music library. All bar one of the existing Bang & Olufsen CRT televisions have also been swapped for high-definition Panasonic Viera flat screens.  The highlight of the refit is the new owner's suite on the main decka space that Clapton and his wife rarely used before the refit, because it is at the opposite end of the yacht to his children's cabins. (They preferred the smaller but more family-friendly location of the VIP guest suite next to the main run of cabins on the lower deck.) But it's a much more enticing space these days. Reconfigured by interior designers H2 in Putney, London, it now enjoys a much bigger family bathroom complete with walk-in rain shower, dramatic stone basins, a large tub and a natural teak floor.  The key to the success of the refit, which cost in excess of US$4 million, lay in the planning. Pendennis's Tyrone Harvey and a small team started with a technical visit to the yacht in Palma, Mallorca, in the early summer of last year. Within days of arriving in Falmouth Va Bene had undergone sea trials with Duncan Propellers to try and improve an ongoing issue with her performance and economy. It eventually transpired that one of the gearboxes had been incorrectly fitted. She was then moored alongside at Pendennis while her crew started the long job of removing her entire inventory. She also had her teak deck stripped off before she was floated into the 150m long dry dock.  Despite all the changes, Va Bene left Falmouth on time, arriving in Sardinia on July 1. Indeed, it was during this holiday that Eric Clapton took time out to talk to SuperYacht World about his born-again Va Bene (see p74). Now that he has had a chance to enjoy the fruits of his and Pendennis's labor, Va Bene is available for charter through Burgess Yachts in the Mediterranean and Caribbean.  It's not often you get to walk in the shadow of a genuine rock legend but on Va Bene you can also swim, sunbathe and sleep in Eric Clapton's personal holiday home. Chartering just doesn't get any better than that.  Subscribe to SuperYachtWorld  COPYRIGHT   2009 IPC MEDIA LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

Washington The Virginia governor's race has often been looked to as an off-year barometer of national political sentiment.  This year's grind-it-out race, an acrimonious spitball contest between two candidates only slightly more likeable than Walter White, is anything but.  In a lesser-of-two-evils campaign, Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Democratic fundraiser and confidante to former President Bill Clinton, is clinging to a modest but sturdy lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli, the state's attorney general.  Republicans have pilloried McAuliffe as a sleazy political operator and failed businessman who exploited his Washington connections to help his sputtering car company, GreenTech Automotive. Cuccinelli has been targeted as a far-right social crusader who would curb abortion rights and access to contraception. Democrats on Twitter are fond of calling him #creepyken.  McAuliffe is leading Cuccinelli among likely voters by an eight-point margin, 47% to 39%, according to a Washington Post poll out this week.  McAuliffe is hardly bulletproof: A federal investigation into GreenTech has sullied his reputation, and only two-thirds of Democratshis own partyconsider him "honest and trustworthy."  But Cuccinelli is on much shakier ground. While Republicans are slightly more fired up about voting for him than Democrats are for McAuliffe, Cuccinelli's favorable ratings are next-to-toxic: More than half of likely voters view him unfavorably.  Enter Robert Sarvis.  As public dismay with the two main candidates calcifies, the baby-faced 37-year old Libertarian candidate from Fairfax has quietly crept northward in the polls, reaching 10% in the Post poll.  That's not nearly enough to win in Novemberwith just five weeks until Election Day, even Sarvis admits "we have to get a lot higher"but he looks increasingly likely to play the role of spoiler by siphoning conservative votes away from Cuccinelli.  Sarvis chafes at the label.  "I don't even know what it means to be a spoiler," he said in an interview. "The system is rotten to the core from Republican and Democratic malfeasance. They have already spoiled the system. I don't even know what it means to be a spoiler. If I am the only one arguing for freedom and the rule of law, then those two are the spoilers as far as I'm concerned."  Positioning himself as a moderate  The Harvard and NYU-educated attorney and software programmerhe was part of a team that won Google's Android Developer Prize for creating a "mobile app for true nightlifers"is positioning himself as the moderate choice between two "extreme" candidates.  In his telling, McAuliffe "stands for an extreme version of crony capitalism." Cuccinelli is "very regressive on social issues" and "unreliable" on economic matters.  Both parties, he said, are in league with the banks and "rich folks"a frustration that first motivated him to run for office in 2011, when he mounted an unsuccessful Republican bid to unseat longtime Democratic state Senate leader Dick Saslaw.  Though he said he left the GOP after that race, he voted in Virginia's Republican presidential primary in 2012, casting a ballot for Ron Paul. That November, he voted for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee.  Sarvis supports same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization and says climate change is real. He opposes gun restrictions, higher taxes, the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and last year's landmark transportation bill in Richmond that raised some taxes to help fix northern Virginia's clogged roadways. Sarvis said he would pay for transportation funding, in part, by cutting from the education budget and finding ways to "prioritize spending."  Sarvis might deny being a spoiler, but Cuccinelli's campaign conceded Thursday that the Libertarian is draining support from the Republican nominee.  "There's no question that a vote for Robert Sarvis is a vote for Terry McAuliffe and a vote against liberty," said Richard Cullen, Cuccinelli's communications director.  "It's important to remember that there's no greater defender of first principles and liberty in Virginia than Ken Cuccinelli," Cullen said, outlining why Libertarian-leaning Republicans should stay in the party fold.  "Ken was the first attorney general in the nation to sue to stop Obamacare and he led an eight year battle to secure Virginians' private property rights in the state constitution. He's also the only candidate in this race who's laid out a clear, substantive plan to free up the private sector and create 58,000 jobs."  Challenges for third-party candidates  Few political observers in Virginia expect Sarvis, who has little money in the bank and almost no political machinery behind him, to reach the 10% threshold, or even the 8% mark he hit in another recent poll from NBC News and Marist.  The last third-party candidate in Virginia to reach that level of support was Marshall Coleman, who snagged 11% of the vote in the madcap three-way 1994 Senate race.  Unlike Sarvis, though, Coleman had political pedigree and bona fide institutional support: then-Sen. John Warner backed Coleman that year over the flame-throwing Republican nominee, Oliver North. The Democratic incumbent, Chuck Robb, eked out a three-point win that year.  A more recent example of third-party noise-making came in the 2005 governor's race, when Russ Potts, a GOP state senator who ran as an independent, aired a memorable statewide television ad featuring people loudly banging on pots as they chanted "We want Potts!"  Despite polling as high as 9% that year, Potts only garnered 2% in the end, as Democrat Tim Kaine edged out Republican Jerry Kilgore to win the governorship.  Even if Sarvis tumbles from his current standing and only captures a small slice of the vote on Election Day, Republicans fear that most of that support will come straight out of Cuccinelli's back pocket, especially in what's expected to be a low turnout election.  "Nearly all of his vote will come from people right of center who feel obligated to vote but can't support Cuccinelli because he is too far to the right, or they fear what he would be like as governor and can't vote for McAuliffe because he's a Democrat," observed one well-connected Richmond Republican who is not directly involved in the race.  Cuccinelli faces gender gap  Cuccinelli is in trouble with or without a third party candidate, due in large part to a startling gender gap that emerged this summer after free-spending Democrats began hammering the Republican on women's health issues.  Women favor McAuliffe over Cuccinelli by an enormous 24-point margin, and even without Sarvis in the race, the Post poll showed McAuliffe leading Cuccinelli by a five-point margin, 49-44.  But Sarvis isn't going anywhere, and his rising poll numbers are making an uphill fight for Cuccinelli that much steeper.  Sarvis' most obvious challenge is exposure. A large majority of Virginia voters still have no clue who he is or what he stands for, a challenge that wasn't made easier by his exclusion from a debate Wednesday night sponsored by the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce.  In response, Sarvis tapped into his meager campaign budgethe reported having only $19,109 in the bank at the end of Augustto run a TV ad during the debate attacking McAuliffe's "cronyism" and Cuccinelli's "narrow-minded social agenda."  The ad starred his two children and his African-American wife, Astrid, whom he met in a Mississippi book store when he spied her reading "The Da Vinci Code" and told her he had recently seen the movie.  John Vaught LaBeaume, a Sarvis adviser, said the campaign has been in touch with the organizers of the third and final debate in Roanoke in late October, and have received "encouraging" signals about being included.  Until then, Sarvis said he's content to meet voters by driving around the commonwealth in his van, listening to Pink Floyd, as the other campaigns savage each other on the airwaves.  "If they keep destroying each other with negative ads that's fine with us," he said drily.  
 Washington As President Barack Obama decides whether to strike ISIS inside Syria, he has political considerations as well.  U.S. lawmakers are watching critically as Obama weighs options on how to deal with the threat from ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.  Many have argued the surge of ISIS is the direct result of lack of strategic action to date from Obama, while others are questioning how broadly Obama's executive authority extends when it comes to taking militarily action.  Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, tells CNN that unless the United States or its citizens face an imminent threat from ISIS, Obama must seek approval from Congress before extended airstrikes against ISIS inside Syria.  "I do think the president should come to Congress if he intends to embark on airstrikes in Syria for the purpose of trying to defeat ISIL," Schiff said Saturday. "If we're talking about the same kind of more general airstrikes we're undertaking in Iraq, that's something that would broaden the mission significantly. And, frankly, I think the case hasn't been made for that yet."  Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and a Republican from California, told CNN that he'd support the use of armed drones on ISIS in Syria.  "I think strikes at this point, against the Syrian ISIS, which has bled into Iraq, those steps should be taken," Royce said. "Had they been taken some time ago, I think ISIS would not have as much influence on the ground as it has now."  U.N.: 'Unspeakable' suffering in Iraqi town besieged by ISIS fighters  Royce said he would not, however, support putting U.S. troops on the ground.  "There is no support in the United States on either side of the aisle for introducing ground troops there," Royce said. "The question is: do we support the Kurds? Do we support the Free Syrian Army in their effort to turn back ISIS? And in doing that, we need to give them the heavy equipment such as anti-tank missiles that desperately they need."  "The most important aspect of this is that this needs to be a dialogue between Congress and the administration in terms of having a strategic plan forward in supporting the Kurdish forces on the ground," said Royce. "That's the infantry that is right now advancing against ISIS, and they need the support."  Perry piles on President  Republican Gov. Rick Perry of Texas tied the ISIS threat into a broader critique of six years of the Obama doctrine.  "When we think about where we are in the international scene, we think about the lack of leadership," Perry said. "When we see what's happened in Libya, Egypt, Israel, Syria, Ukraine and now back in Iraq that we were told three years ago was secure and al Qaeda was on the run and we see the enemy that we are having to deal with."  Perry, who is considering a bid for the Republican nomination in 2016, made the remarks at a rally for New Hampshire Republican activists.  The United States on Saturay carried out another airstrike in near the strategically important Mosul Dam in Iraq, according to the Defense Department. It's the 62nd such strike in support of Kurdish forces fighting for control of the dam and the 94th of the campaign against ISIS, which began August 8 and has included daily strikes.  U.S. intelligence agencies are gathering information on the locations of ISIS leadership and troops in Syria, two U.S. officials have told CNN. Separately, U.S. officials said the military has been talking about increasing airstrikes in Iraq and possibly carrying out tailored airstrikes inside Syria against ISIS targets.  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey signaled the United States was gearing up for a significant change both in rhetoric and action regarding ISIS in Syria.  "Can [ISIS] be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no," Dempsey told reporters Thursday. "That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border. And that will come when we have a coalition in the region that takes on the task of defeating ISIS over time."  Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst who has researched terror groups for decades, said it will be difficult to defeat ISIS without ground forces.  'What does day two look like?'  But American's gloomy feelings of war fatigue will make consensus building for action in Syria a difficult sell.  "President Obama has been very reluctant to get involved in Syria because what does day two look like?" Bergen said. "Two of the most effective fighting forces in Syria are al Qaeda or al Qaeda splinter groups, or groups like Hezbollah, backed by Iran. So if you intervene, you may be helping Iran and Hezbollah and [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's] regime."  Royce told CNN, however, that there are groups in Syria with which the United States can align.  "We should be arming the Free Syrian Army," Royce said. "It was the opposition to Assad. It was clear that ISIS in a vacuum would move into that position. That's what we have seen happen."  Adding another layer to the political and security calculus for the White House, intervention in Syria is more complicated than the ongoing airstrikes in Iraq due to international law, Bergen said.  "You could imagine some combination of U.S. Special Forces in small numbers, drone strikes, and airstrikes in Syria just as has been taking place in Iraq. But it's a pretty big bridge to cross," Bergen said.  "The Iraq government is inviting us to do these strikes in Iraq. The Syrian government certainly wouldn't be inviting us to intervene militarily in Syria. So there's a good question of international law, which after all the administration and the United States has good reasons to uphold."

Think hotels are deliberately blocking your personal Wi-Fi networks so you'll buy theirs?  No, it's not just a conspiracy theory. It turns out the federal government is concerned about it, too.  Marriott has agreed to pay a $600,000 fine after the Federal Communications Commission found the company blocked consumer Wi-Fi networks last year during an event at a hotel and conference center in Nashville.  At the same time, Marriott was charging exhibitors and others as much as $1,000 per device to access the hotel's wireless network, the FCC announced Friday.  "Consumers who purchase cellular data plans should be able to use them without fear that their personal Internet connection will be blocked by their hotel or conference center," FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc said in a statement.  Federal law prohibits people from using a device that interferes with cellular, GPS or wireless networks.  It's the first time the FCC has investigated a hotel property for blocking its guests' Wi-Fi, according to a senior FCC official with knowledge of the investigation. The unlawful blocking isn't "jamming" in the traditional sense, where someone uses a jammer device to block wireless signals. Instead, Marriott employees were using the hotel's own Wi-Fi system to block other people's hot spots, the FCC official said.  The order doesn't just affect one Marriott property.  Under the FCC consent decree, Marriott must not block guests' Wi-Fi at all of the properties it owns and manages. The company must also file compliance plans with the FCC every three months for three years.  A federal investigation of the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center in Nashville found that Marriott employees had used "containment features of a Wi-Fi monitoring system" at the hotel to prevent people from accessing their own personal Wi-Fi networks.  "It is unacceptable for any hotel to intentionally disable personal hot spots while also charging consumers and small businesses high fees to use the hotel's own Wi-Fi network," LeBlanc said. "This practice puts consumers in the untenable position of either paying twice for the same service or forgoing Internet access altogether."  The Boogie Down Bronx  Marriott issued the following statement Friday afternoon defending its actions:  "Marriott has a strong interest in ensuring that when our guests use our Wi-Fi service, they will be protected from rogue wireless hot spots that can cause degraded service, insidious cyber-attacks and identity theft," the statement said. "Like many other institutions and companies in a wide variety of industries, including hospitals and universities, the Gaylord Opryland protected its Wi-Fi network by using FCC-authorized equipment provided by well-known, reputable manufacturers.  "We believe that the Opryland's actions were lawful.  We will continue to encourage the FCC to pursue a rulemaking in order to eliminate the ongoing confusion resulting from today's action and to assess the merits of its underlying policy."  In March 2013, the FCC received a complaint from someone who had attended an event at the Gaylord Opryland and claimed the hotel was "jamming mobile hot spots so that you can't use them in the convention space," the FCC statement said.  Saving a Flying Fortress  Blocking a traveler's personal Wi-Fi will only serve to aggravate hotel guests further, said Benet Wilson, who blogs about travel at AviationQueen.com.  "Travelers are already annoyed that higher-end hotels continue to charge for subpar Wi-Fi, which is why they bring their own," Wilson told CNN.  "So it's really galling when you hear of a company like Marriott, which has a good reputation that does something that causes a major inconvenience to its customers. And the fact that they profited off of their customers in such a blatant way also doesn't help."  Marriott and its brands operate more than 3,000 hotels in the United States, according to the company's website.  
 At least 33 people were killed and 26 others hurt on Friday night when a suicide bomber with an explosive vest blew himself up inside an coffee shop where patrons were playing a popular Ramadan game in Kirkuk, Iraq, police said.  The explosion occurred in a cafe called Classic, which is in the Wahed Hozyran neighborhood in central Kirkuk about 240 kilometers, or 149 miles, north of Baghdad, according to authorities in Kirkuk and Baghdad.  Patrons were playing a game common among Iraqis during Ramadan in which participants must guess whose fist is hiding a small ring. The game, Mahaibes, is played in the evenings when Muslims take a break from their monthlong daylight fasting.  The bombing occurred about 10 p.m. Friday local time.  The ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk is one of disputed areas claimed by the Iraqi central government and the regional government of ethnic Kurds.  Sunni extremists, including al Qaeda groups, have carried out similar attacks during prior Ramadans, but no group claimed the responsibility for the bombing in its immediate aftermath.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil On any other day, Copacabana Beach has a hypnotic ability to relax its guests. Its crescent-like coastwhere coconut water is coolly sipped, Brazilian sun beats down and hodgepodge hotels stand, juxtaposed against the dramatic peak of the Sugarloaf Mountain and her sisterscalms the most stressed-out of Cariocas and turns city-workaholics into lackadaisical loungers.  But not on this day; currently there is a very different atmosphere on its golden sands.  Events have conspired for the benevolent beach to now act as a gritty site of torture, where the searing heat is only adding to the discomfort of the thousands gathered. Nearly all to a man are wrapped in yellow and wracked with anxiety. Many hide their faces, unable to bear the sights their eyes witness, struggling to contemplate the repercussions of events that are transpiring.  The Jumbotron screen, that sits before those assembled, beams live pictures of a nation on the precipice. This proud country's heroes, the warriors of the people, have battled with all their hearts only to sit moments from humbling, embarrassing defeat.  But this is not a war with the lives of soldiers on the line, or a natural calamity that has befallen a population. No, Brazil's national football team is in a World Cup penalty shootout with regional rivals Chile and, as a result, 200 million people are on the edge of a nervous breakdown.  Security guards abandon their posts to gather around surveillance vehicles, which have their TVs trained to live football rather than CCTV feeds of trouble hotspots. On the underground metro, each commuter battles to get mobile phone connection so they can update the rest of the carriage with the latest news. The streets are silent bar the overspill of punters straining their necks to view the action through the doorways and windows of fan-filled restaurants.  A 22-year-old man called Neymar steps up to the penalty spot to take his chance and the entire country, including the thousands at the FIFA Fan Fest on Copacabana Beach, holds its breath and prays for salvation ...  -----||||------  There aren't many countries in the world that have a national holiday every time the national teams play, or whose media eclipsed reports of the Apollo 12 moon landing with news of Pel's 1,000th goal. But Brazil's relationship with the side they lovingly term the 'Selecao' is far from normal.  "When you're born in Brazil your father will hang the shirt of the team you're going to follow on the door of your room. There's a joke we say that sexual orientation, religion ... all of that you can choose but not the team. Football is part of your life even in the hospital when you're born.  "And for many, when you die, your coffin is covered with the flag of the team ... so football is from birth to death," Jamil Chade, European correspondent for Estado de Sao Paulo told CNN.  At a time when the so-called 'spiritual home of football' is playing host to the World Cup, a tournament that has fans dew-eyed the world over regardless, it is maybe understandable why emotions are currently running high.  Ever since British enthusiasts formally introduced the sport in 1892, Brazil has been besotted by football. Some say it's tantamount to a religion but for David Goldblatt, author of "Futebol Nation: The Story of Brazil through Soccer", this clich misses important details.  Infographic: How women are watching the World Cup  "There isn't a divine being, moral framework or holy book so it's better to think of it as a mixture of national ritual, popular theater and collective soap opera," Goldblatt told CNN.  "[Football has a] church element, in terms of ritual collective gatherings, in a regular place in a regular time. It's a multi-level, multi-character rolling story commenting on the rest of the world. And it's a form of popular theater in the way the dramatic narrative of the matches plays out. So it's not a religion but the rest add ups to quite a lot."  And it was for these reasons the sport has played such a powerful role in shaping the Brazilian national identity after it became independent in 1822.  "When the intelligentsia asked 'what is Brazil?' the pervading idea was that of a white, European nation in the tropics ... which worked for about five people in Rio, but for a country that has a 60% Afro-Brazilian mix it was never really going to be enough," Goldblatt said.  An ideal was needed to bind the nation, one that was representative of the demographic heritage of Brazil and at the same time emblematic of the aspirations of the new state. Football, Goldblatt argues, fitted the bill.  "Firstly, [Brazil] get huge international recognition when they come third in the 1938 World Cup. Secondly, football had appeal beyond the literate population, [it was] a medium that could ... reach the high degree of illiterate across the country. And crucially, from the 1930s it's the first arena in Brazilian public life that was ethnically integrated."  It's a sentiment with which Chade, a Sao Paulo native and resident, agrees: "Football is one of the few elements that unites the sentiment of Brazil. There's very little that unifies someone who lives in the Amazon with someone who lives in Sao Paulo.  "There are few elements that glue the society together. That is why it's such a drama when the 'Selecao' lose, because it's not the football team losing it's your own identity as a Brazilian that is questioned."  Politics and art alike became intertwined with this powerful vehicle for connecting with a diverse and disparate population. Eminent Brazilian sociologist Gilberto Freye saw football as integral to the emerging personality of his home nation. After watching the team fail in its attempt to become world champions in France 1938, he wrote:  "Our style of football seems to contrast to the [acute and angular] Europeans because of a set of characteristics: surprise, craftiness, shrewdness, recklessness and individual expression and spontaneity. Our mulatto (mixed race) football is an expression of our social order."  And before 1950 a key debate in Brazil was whether their social order was enough to be included within the world's "concert of civilized nations." Despite sending troops to the Second World War, Brazil's request for a seat on the U.N. Security Council had been rejected. Then they lost out on the 1950 World Cup to rivals Uruguay, despite being hosts.  "When the loss to Uruguay happened in the 1950 there was a thought that our destiny was to forever be in the margins of the center of the world. The drama was not the loss on the pitch, or the suicides that followed but it was a crisis of national identity," Chade said.  "Nelson Rodrigues [a famous Brazilian playwright, journalist and iconoclast] said that when we won the World Cup in 1958 that: 'After 458 years we have finally stood up.'  "So we're not talking just about football [when it comes to the Selecao], of course it's just eleven against eleven, of course it doesn't change anything in your life, but it is a mirror of a situationand in the case of Brazil it reflects our national identity," Chade added.  To this day the national team also mirror many of the key issues in Brazilian society.  "Brazil's booming economy is built on commodity export: iron ore, sugar, soya beans and oil without ever getting the key value of these because they end up being processed further down the value chain ... and it's the same with football," said Goldblatt.  "In the year 2009, 1200 footballers left Brazil to play elsewhere. Only the old, the very young and the not very good stay home ... Now, if you want to see the best Brazilian footballers, you need to watch the [European] Champions League."  "This [current national team], bar two, are all playing overseas. So they're more cosmopolitan and to my eyes they play European football. I'm not sure a Brazilian style exists any more ... but it's an inevitable consequence of globalization," Goldblatt added.  Chade agrees the Brazilian style is all but gone: "Some say Germany are playing like Brazil used to. It's not a process that's happening just with Brazil. I think [globalization] feeds both ways. But if a player leaves Brazil at 18 and plays in another league with another characteristic until 32 how can he play with a Brazilian characteristic."  Not that a change in style seems to have diminished the passion of the support that Brazil enjoy.  -----||||------  "Goooooooll!!!!!" shout a million or more Brazil fans as Neymar slots his penalty into the corner of the goal-net. Anxiety and fear turn to hope and excitement. Tears remain poised for release.  Chile's Gonzalo Jara is next up. He just needs to score from 12 yards to keep his side in the competition.  Thwack!  He shoots ... and hits the post!  A collective shedding of emotion takes place across Brazil's vast land, relief and elation painted on the faces of the faithful, tears rolling forth, fireworks exploding like machine guns.  The 'Selecao' live to fight another day, progress to be one-game closer to winning the World Cup they covet so dearly, and show the planet that Brazil is as vibrant and beautiful as ever.  Tune in Friday, when the fate of the nation will once again be decided.  
 London, England For Greek cinema, the shadow of auteur Theo Angelopoulos has cast long over the blue sky of the Cote d'Azur in Cannes.  With a minimal presence abroad, Greek film has often relied on the reputable auteur for international recognition.  Recently a new light has been shining for Greek cinema internationally.  Earlier this year, over a decade after "Eternity and a Day" handed Angelopoulos a "Palme d'Or," Yorgos Lanthinos has managed to get modern Greek cinematography back in the line-up at the prestigious world of Cannes Film Festival.  His sophomore film, "Dogtooth," won the "Un Certain Regard" prize in the 62nd edition of the festival and gave the 36-year-old director one of the most coveted prizes awarded to young filmmakers.  Here, Lanthimos talks to The Screening Room only a few days after "Dogtooth's" latest winfirst prize at the Stockholm Film Festival.  The Screening Room: "Dogtooth" is about three siblings who grow up in complete seclusion, isolated by their parents from society. How did you come up with the story?  Yorgos Lanthimos: I co-wrote the script for "Dogtooth" with Efthimis Filippou. I wanted to write a story about the waning of the traditional family. Then, I thought of a father who wants to protect his family unit at all costs and the system he invents in order to do this.  The siblings in "Dogtooth" are only taught what their parents choose to reveal to them about the world, and this is very little. The teens are only allowed to exercise, play with each other and watch home videos. They don't know what a telephone is and they think that airplanes only exist as toys. They are told that their most feared enemy is a cat and they are taught to bark and act obediently like dogs.  TSR: Can you identify a new wave of films coming out of Greece and do these films have a singular voice?  YL:No, the films that do well in Greece are very different from each other. I think one of the advantage of not having a proper film school is that Greece now has several individual films to showcase. There is not a single Greek new wave with common characteristics. For example, to mention some recent films, Panos Koutras' "Strella," "Black Field" by Vardis Marinakis and "Dogtooth" are all very different from one another.  TSR: How did you finance "Dogtooth," and what particular production challenges did you face?  YL: Funding is the biggest challenge for Greek filmmakers. "Dogtooth" received about $300,000 ( 200,000) from the Greek Film Center, the state body supporting Greek film production.  BOO Productions and I put in a large amount of money and a lot of our friends volunteered their time and talent to this production.  Due to a lack of funds, many Greek films end up being made because people volunteer their time to filmmakers, but this is not necessarily a healthy practice for the film industry.  TSR: What is the kind of reception "Dogtooth" has gotten so far?  YL: "El Divo" director and the 2009 Cannes Jury President Paulo Sorrentino said that "Dogtooth" completely surprised him. Because most Greek films do not find international distributors, most viewers have a limited idea of what a Greek film is. Most people think of a fisherman, a beautiful island, and ancient ruins. Most of "Dogtooth" is shot in a big house and the surrounding garden, as the children are not allowed outside the house. In this way, the film played with the expectation viewers had when going to see a Greek film.  TSR: 20th Century Fox CEO Jim Gianopoulos told The Screening Room that when a film is rooted in it's local culture, it doesn't necessarily travel as well. Do you think "Dogtooth" is a universal story?  YL: I think it is universal. It's a commentary on mass illusion, how world leaders and the media only channel certain information to the public, isolating us from the truth. It's also a commentary on what happens to human beings functioning in a climate of oppression.  TSR: Can art and commerce go hand in hand for a filmmaker?  YL: It depends what films you want to make. I think art and commerce can co-exist side by side in the same film. For example, it is a big surprise to all of us that an arthouse film like "Dogtooth" is doing really well at the Greek box office: 25,000 admissions in Greece is considered a market success. After a six week run in two cities, "Dogtooth" is still screening. We have also secured several international distribution deals, including North American distribution, the Benelux countries, France and Spain.  TSR: The Filmmakers of Greece (FoG), a group of filmmakers you belong to, is asking the Greek for an overhaul of its legal framework for the film industry. What does FoG hope to see in the new cinema law?  YL: The FoG group would like to see tax incentives for private investment in films. It's really discouraging that, despite a law requiring private television networks to reinvest 1.5 percent of their earnings back into the local film industry, this is hardly ever executed. What's really extraordinary about FoG is that it's the first time that more than 200 film industryites have joined forces in asking for drastic and immediate change of the filmmaking environment in Greece. The current film industry cannot advance with a law that is 20 years old.  Besides abstaining from the Thessaloniki Film Festival this year, a group of filmmakers that sprung out of FoG are dedicating their efforts to an independent Greek Film Academy, which will award its own prizes to the best talent in Greece.

Walt Disney World is billed as the "happiest place on Earth," but it's anything but in the subversive new film, "Escape From Tomorrow." Randy Moore's directorial debut focuses on a man who slowly descends into madness while vacationing with his wife and children: Grim reality keeps intruding onto a theme park experience designed to banish every moment of melancholy. In Moore's vision, jolly Disney characters become fearsome ghouls; an epidemic of "cat flu" threatens to sicken visitors; an undercurrent of sex runs through this place meant to stand for innocent family fun.  It's a darkly comic and unflattering critique of Disney culture. So why would Disney ever allow Moore to shoot his movie inside Disneyland and Disney World? The answer is it never gave him permission. Moore, his actors and crew infiltrated the parks without Disney ever catching on. The cinematic subterfuge went on for weeks; Moore shot for about 10 days in Orlando, Florida and even longer at Disneyland in Anaheim, California.  "There was high anxiety the entire time while we were making this film," Moore admitted. He said the stress was so great, "I lost a ton of weight. I was 215 (pounds) and slimmed down to 168 by the end of this shoot."  Pulling it off  Moore said pulling of his unlikely feat required tremendous planning. "We weren't just running in there and improvising, 'Oh, here's a nice place to put the camera,'" he said. "We did a lot of scouting (in the parks). We walked through the movie at least nine times before we brought in the actors. ...The position of the sun was charted weeks ahead of time for every shot."  The movie includes several images of an eerily depopulated parknot easy to arrange when contending with thousands of visitors. "As soon as they opened the doors we sort of rushed in and got the shot (of the empty park)," Moore recalled. "We had like maybe 20 seconds before people would get into (the frame)."  Why Disney might want to 'Escape From Tomorrow'  Technological breakthrough  Moore understood there was no way he could shoot his movie with anything like a traditional motion picture camera. A breakthrough came courtesy of the Canon 5D Mark II cameraa digital SLR that can shoot high-quality video. "The 5D's small size and low-light capabilities were what made everything possible, allowing me the freedom to set up shots and move fast without sacrificing picture quality," Moore explained in a "director's statement" that accompanies press notes for the film (Moore told CNN he hasn't been paid anything by Canon to sing the praises of its product).  The innocent looking camera was key to avoiding detection by Disney security. "The thing about those parks is everyone has a camera there," Moore said. "So we were not the few people with cameras in the midst of a crowd of people. We were just normal. We probably would have looked out of place if we didn't have cameras."  But shooting video was only half the equation; just as big a challenge was figuring out how to record the actors' dialogue. Once again, technology came to the rescue.  "What we ended (up) doing was using these tiny Olympus pocket recorders that business people use mainly for dictation purposes," Moore explained in his director's statement. "They're great because they run for 18 hours straight on one battery; they have an auto-leveler function; they record almost at CD quality; and they have a mic input, so I could easily run a standard lavalier mic into them."  Smartphones also helped. "We had a shot list for every single shot. We kept those on our phones, as well as our scripts," Moore said.  It's a Small World After All  To get the shots of Disney attractions that he needed, Moore, his crew and actors had to board the ridesrepeatedly.  "I think we rode 'It's a Small World After All' 12 times in a row," Moore said. "And it was not a low park attendance day. There were a lot of people there. So, every time we were in line for probably 40 minutes. So that's all we did that day was ride 'Small World.' That was a rough day."  The team used Fast Passes whenever possible, but that only helped so much, as when they filmed a sequence at Disneyland's Autopia ride. "It was such a busy day (at the park) the line even with a Fast Pass was 25 minutes."  Paying Disney back  Disney hasn't filed suit against Moore despite his ample use of the company's copyrighted images (no doubt concluding a lawsuit would only increase public awareness of "Escape From Tomorrow"). Disney did get something out of it: Moore estimates he spent between $15,000 and $20,000 on season passes to the parks to accommodate his cast and crew. And then of course there was food.  "We ate all our meals in the park," Moore said. "It was just easier, more convenient." The director's favorite Disney eatery? The Royal Street Veranda in Disneyland. "They have these bread bowls with clam chowder or gumbo and they're fantastic."  To Disney or not to Disney?  The closest call  Moore said to the best of his knowledge no Disney park patrons ever caught on that a film was being made right in their midst. He and his crew also managed to escape detection by Disney security personnel, until near the end of filming in Anaheim. Then suddenly, after weeks of surreptitious shooting, the game was almost up.  "There was a moment when the actors had to enter the park through the turnstiles a few times," Moore recalled. "We had to do multiple takes of them walking into the park. And at one point a security officer came to our lead actor (Roy Abramsohn) and asked if he was famous. ... He said no and then they asked, 'Why do you have paparazzi following you?'"  Abramsohn and Elena Schuber, who plays his wife, had to do a quick improv to throw the officer off the scent. "I said (to Elena), 'Hey, honey, they think we're famous!'" Abramsohn recalled. "Yeah, all of a sudden now we're really acting," Schuber said. When the officer asked why the pair had entered and then re-entered the park twice within a matter of minutes, they explained they had left their sunscreen in the car and had to go back to apply it on their kids.  The actors realized it would be tough to explain why they were wearing sound recording equipment, so they said the young actors playing their kids needed to use the restroom.  They took that opportunity to stash the equipment.  "I put it in my sock, which I thought was the last place they would maybe look," Abramsohn said. "There aren't that many choices when you're wearing a pair of shorts."  Abramsohn, Schuber and their movie kids profited from a passing parade to disperse into the crowd, and then hightail it out of the park. A close call, but the actors said by that point they were used to shooting on the sly. "It was exciting," Abramsohn said. Said Schuber, "Luckily that was our only close encounter. We pulled off all the other things."  All is (almost) lost  But even after they finished shooting in the parks, the filmmakers' troubles weren't over. Screening the footage he had captured in Orlando, Moore's heart sank. There was a big blotch on the videoall of it.  "It was through every shot," Moore said. "I thought, 'The whole film is ruined! We have a giant black dot near the center of the movie for everything!'" The culprit was tree sap that had somehow slimed the camera's sensor. Moore still doesn't know how it happened, but the digital gods smiled on him and a company in South Korea was able to remove the blemishes in post-production. Another escape for "Escape From Tomorrow."  Moore consistently beat the odds to get his movie made and into theaters: first by eluding Disney security, then earning a spot in the Sundance Film Festival (where the film premiered in January) and ultimately finding a distributor willing to risk the wrath of the Walt Disney Company. But when he returned to Anaheim for an interview with CNN just outside Disneyland property, Moore felt understandably apprehensive.  "It's strange being back here in the belly of the beast," he said. "I feel like a mouse's hand is going to cover my face with chloroform at any moment and drag me away."  
 Valley Springs, California Sheriff's deputies on foot and in patrol cars made their presence known at a northern California school on Monday.  Amid the stepped up security, classmates at Jenny Lind Elementary School carried flowers for Leila Fowler. Their parents held onto fear.  "I'm scared for my kids, for the family," mother Wendy Converse said. "It's horrible."  Fowler, an 8-year-old third-grader at the school, was stabbed to death at her home over the weekend.  As police search for suspects, word of the killing has left many shaken in the community, which is about an hour outside of Sacramento.  "Leila was bubbly, she was vivacious, a great student. ... I don't think I ever saw Leila without a smile on her face," Amy Hasselwander, the school's principal, told CNN affiliate KCRA. "Just a bright girl, just kind, compassionate, sincere to everyone."  Converse said her son, Elijah, was friends with Leila.  "They sit together at school. It's very sad," she said. "Things like that don't happen here."  The girl died of shock and hemorrhages caused by multiple stab wounds, the Calaveras County Coroner's Office said on Monday.  Her mother said the family was still coming to grips with their loss.  "We are devastated," Crystal Walters, Leila's mother, told CNN via Facebook correspondence early Monday. "She didn't deserve this. ... She was so full of life."  No suspect named  Police say Leila and her brother were home alone on Saturday when he saw an intruder leaving the house.  He then found his sister stabbed and severely wounded. She died minutes after arriving at the hospital, authorities said.  Since then, police have been running down leads but say they have no specific suspect.  "We're searching extensively into attics and storage sheds. It is a difficult area to searchit is rural, remote and the grass is tall right now," Calaveras County Sheriff's Capt. Jim Macedo said.  Authorities have combed the home and the neighborhood for evidence.  "We did collect fingerprints during that search," Macedo said, "and we did collect what we believe to be DNA. Those prints and DNA will hopefully be processed within the next week."  A neighborhood on edge  Word of the killing rattled many residents in the neighborhood.  Michael Range, who lives near the Fowlers, said he heard about Leila's deadly stabbing from a boy who lives nearby.  "I took my kids instantly and locked the doors," he said. "It was scary. We've been inside all weekend."  Ryan Wydner, who lives across the street from the Fowlers, said the girl's death left him feeling anxious.  "Anything's really possible at this point," he said. "What's the difference between that guy going left and right and coming into my house? I don't know."  While authorities said they had "no specific suspect," they are looking for a white or Hispanic male with a muscular build, about 6 feet tall, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and blue pants. He is considered to be armed and dangerous, the Sheriff's Office said.  Macedo said the boy who found his sister "is not a suspect at this time, but we are continuing to talk to him, which would be normal because he was the last person with the child."  Detectives continue to track down dozens of leads phoned into a tip line created Saturday, including some leading to other counties, he said.  More than 100 members of the law enforcement community are working on this case, Macedo said.

Roger Federer dropped his serve just once during a two-hour battle with Andy Roddick at the Miami Masters, but it was enough to end the former world No. 1's 16-match winning streak.  Federer, who has already clinched three titles in 2012, boasts a strong record against world No. 34 Roddick and has beaten the American in four major finals among his record 16 grand slam crowns.  But Roddick, the U.S. Open champion in 2003, dug deep to record a 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 6-4 winonly his third over the Swiss in 24 meetings and his second at the U.S. hard-court event.  "For me, it was obviously a tough loss," Federer told the tournament's official website. "The one service game where I got broken, he really goes for it and it all works out.  "I had my chances. I thought Andy did well to get the first, and then to put me in the situation I guess in the third. I could have been up a break early in the third, but he did well also to fight off those break points. He served really well."  Roddick, a two-time winner in Miami, set up a last-16 tie against Argentine 21st seed Juan Monaco.  "It was kind of a game of chess," said Roddick, also a former world No. 1. "I stayed back on the returns, which is something I have not done with him often early on. I think he might have been a little bit surprised by it.  "He started coming in a lot and putting the pressure on me, and it was 6-1 in the second and 0-40 early in the third. It was apparent that that wasn't going to work much longer.  "So I said, 'Well, all right. Let's kinda go over the top aggressive.' I was able to get out of that game and play that really good game to break, and then my serve held up from there."  Defending champion Novak Djokovic had no such problems, as the world No. 1 won 6-3 6-4 against fellow Serb and 27th seed Viktor Troicki to set up a clash with Frenchman Richard Gasquet.  "Generally, I feel that I have been playing well in my first two matches," the 2012 Australian Open champion said.  "I did have some ups and downs, especially in today's match, but I'm confident that I can raise the level of performance in every match."  Spanish fifth seed David Ferrer and 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin del Potro will face off on Tuesday after scoring wins against French No. 30 Julien Benneteau and 23rd-ranked Croat Marin Cilic respectively.  U.S. No. 1 Mardy Fish also advanced with a straight-sets defeat of South African No. 28 Kevin Anderson. Spanish 12 seed Nicolas Almagro awaits in the next round, having beaten compatriot Fernando Verdasco 6-3 6-4.  "Almagro has been playing great this year, even on hard courts," said Fish. "He'll be a tough player."  
 I come from a family with diverse religious traditions: Baptist, Methodist, Apostolic, Buddhist and nondenominational. My mother was a spiritual seeker, and when she became Catholic, I was baptized into the Catholic faith as a young child.  Growing up, I attended a parish with Irish, Polish and black Catholics, and observed that the spiritual gifts of black Catholics were often diminished. When it was suggested that we include a gospel song in the liturgy, we were told that was not Catholic. "Ave Maria" was sung, but not "Mary had a Baby," a Negro spiritual. I learned about St. Theresa the "Little Flower," but not St. Benedict the Black. A Kwanzaa table was a no-no.  I learned while the word "catholic" meant "universal" and "involving all," much of the gifts and experience of black Catholics were not included.  Black Catholics have a heightened awareness of what W.E.B. Dubois called "double consciousness." This emerges from the tension between one's awareness of self and how others perceive one. Dubois used this term to speak of the experience of black people within the segregated United States. Today, a particular form of double consciousness is experienced by black Catholics: as a religious minority within the broader black Church community, who defend our religious affiliation to our black Protestant brothers and sisters while also confronting discrimination and ignorance from those within our own Catholic churches.  What has helped black Catholics survive in the midst of almost insurmountable odds is a spirituality that bridges both our African-American experience and our Catholic faith.  Father Augustus Tolton, the first recognized African-American priest, lived a similar struggle. His mother escaped slavery with him and his siblings, settling in Quincy, Illinois. He was baptized as a child, and by the time he was 16, he felt "called" to the Roman Catholic priesthood. No American Catholic seminaries accepted a black man, so in 1880, he traveled to Rome, Italy. He was ordained six years later, then returned to America to begin his pastoral ministry.  After returning to Quincy, he was invited to Chicago, Illinois, by the local bishop. He began his new ministry at St. Mary's Church in Chicago. The basement of the church became the sanctuary for the emerging black Catholic congregation, the St. Augustine Society. His remaining years in Chicago were focused on ministering with and building a church for this community. He was a priest for only 11 years before he died from heat stroke.  Earlier this year, Cardinal Francis George of the Archdiocese of Chicago announced that he planned to nominate Father Tolton for sainthood. It begins a process that will take some time to complete. Bishop Joseph N. Perry was appointed to highlight his cause. In literature promoting that cause for sainthood, the bishop wrote "Fr. Tolton grew accustomed to adversity during his short life. He brought hope and comfort to the dying and promises of better days for the living." His model of perseverance and holiness is a testament to all Catholics and persons of faith who are confronted with challenges.  Father Tolton's experience resonates with many black Catholics. For every two steps forwardthe ordination and cause for sainthood of Father Augustus Tolton, the National Black Catholic Lay Congresses of the 19th and 20th centuriesthere are two steps back, like the recent shuttering of the African-American parishes and schools in the inner cities of Chicago, St. Louis, Missouri, and Los Angeles, California, and the struggles of black Catholic lay ministerial leadership who strive to be accepted within the broader church.  I have experienced the tension and the joys of being both black and Catholic in my 25 years of ministry. I struggle with the fact that many of my brothers and sisters of African descent do not know this history or see themselves mirrored in the leadership within the Catholic Church in the United States. It is why I went on to study and teach at a graduate school, to help my brothers and sisters understand, and see their story as a part of the Catholic Church.  Despite the challenges, our lives are enriched by our faith and sturdied by the example of Father Tolton.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. C. Vanessa White.

For the first time since detailed records began being kept in 1992, undocumented immigrants from Mexico made up less than half of those apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.  More Central Americans were caught crossing into the United States illegally than Mexicans, according to statistics released Friday by the Department of Homeland Security.  While Mexicans made up the single largest nationality apprehended by CBP, the combined number of Hondurans, El Salvadorans and Guatemalans apprehended was even larger.  "It's the first time in recent history where (migrants other than Mexicans) exceeded Mexican nationals," a DHS official said.  But the big picture remains the same: Statistics show that the number of apprehensions of undocumented immigrants remains low, compared to a peak in 2000.  The debate over illegal immigration in the United States is often tied to the relationship the country has with Mexico, but the flow of migration are slowing from Mexico and increasing from Central America.  "This year's statistics are informed by a number of complex and shifting factors, most notably the 68% increase in migration from countries other than Mexico, predominately from Central America, and a 14% drop in Mexican migration since fiscal year 2013," Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement.  While the statistics released Friday, which cover fiscal year 2014, show result of changing migration trends, it was not a surprise for officials.  For at least four years, the trend has been the similardecreases in Mexican migration and increases in migrants from Central America, the official said.  In 2014, migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador represented 49% of all apprehensions. Mexican nationals made up 47% and migrants of other nationalities made up the rest.  The changes in migration reflect the improving economic situation in Mexico, and the worsening security situation in Central America.  Unaccompanied minors  The number of apprehensions this year486,651was slightly higher than the 420,789 migrants apprehended in 2013. CBP cites the surge in unaccompanied children and families who crossed illegally and turner themselves in to Border Patrol agents earlier this year.  Some 68,631 unaccompanied children were apprehended in 2014, an increase of 76% compared to 2013. The number of family units apprehended in 2014 was 68,684, an increase of 356%.  Officials say the surge, which spiked over the summer, was controlled by September.  For immigrant children, fate in U.S. a roll of the dice  Deportation priorities  During his term, President Barack Obama has used executive action to provide relief from deportation for some undocumented immigrants and set priorities for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  These moves have postponed deportation proceedings against some who were brought illegally into the United States as children, and focused efforts of deporting those with criminal records.  24 states now suing Obama over immigration  Still, immigrant advocates say families continue to be separated, even when there is no criminal conviction, by immigration enforcement measures.  ICE reported that it is meeting the priorities with more success than before.  Most of the undocumented immigrants removed or returned by ICE were apprehended at the border. About one-third of of those removed or returned by ICE were caught in the interior of the country.  This year, 85% of those who were apprehended in the interior and deported had been convicted of a criminal offense, compared to 67% in 2011.  According to the agency, 98% of the immigrants it returned or removed fell under one of the categories for priority deportation.  ICE noted that its removals reflected the same trend of more Central Americans and less Mexicans. Removals of Central Americans increased in 2014, the agency reported, while removals of Mexicans decreased.  
 Atlanta, Georgia A stay of execution for a man scheduled to die by lethal injection Wednesday evening in Georgia has been upheld by the state's Supreme Court.  On Tuesday, a lower court delayed the execution of Marcus Ray Johnson, 46, after new evidence in the case surfaced.  Johnson's lawyers had filed an emergency motion requesting a new trial and time to conduct DNA testing after evidence was recently produced by police in Albany, Georgia.  Dougherty County Superior Court Judge Willie Lockette granted the stay, and set a hearing scheduled for February 1, 2012, on Johnson's motion for additional testing.  The Georgia Supreme Court agreed with the lower court in an unanimous ruling.  Johnson was convicted and sentenced to death for the March 1994 rape and murder of Angela Sizemore in Albany, Georgia.  Human rights group Amnesty International praised the stay, based on doubt raised about Johnson's guilt and the emergence of evidence that had not yet been analyzed.  "Amnesty International hopes that this is a sign that there is greater concern in Georgia about the fallibility of the death penalty, especially on the heels of the outrageous and unnecessary execution of Troy Davis."  Georgia inmate Troy Davis died by lethal injection two weeks ago in a contentious case that traveled up to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Davis' supporters argued that his conviction for the 1989 murder of Mark MacPhail, an off-duty Savannah police officer, was based on the testimony of numerous witnesses who had recanted, including a jailhouse informer who claimed Davis had confessed.  CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.

The thought came to Don Walker during that most quintessential of American outingsa baseball game.  Caught in a crush of people on his way into Atlanta's Turner Field, he couldn't help but think about what had just happened in Bostonsports fans crowded into a small space, a bomb tucked into a backpack, and then death.  Not that it stopped the Morgantown, West Virginia, man from enjoying his Atlanta vacation.  "You just watch things more closely," he said.  Americans are doing a lot of that these days, especially after Monday's attack on the Boston Marathon, where three people died and more than 180 were wounded when a pair of bombs exploded near the finish line:   A palpable sense of fear and confusion played out in the nation's capital, at a Senate office in Michigan and on television screens across the country as authorities scrambled to deal with a spate of suspicious package reports. The first floor of Washington's Hart Senate Office Building was evacuated at one point. Among the concerns were letters that initial tests suggested contained ricin, eerily echoing fears raised by letters containing anthrax mailed to lawmakers after the 9/11 attacks.  Capitol HIll Police Chief Terry Gainer acknowledged "a bit of anxiety" in a letter to senators.  "The bottom line of this multifaceted event was a positive one," Gainer wrote. "The packages were not dangerous; they contained nothing hazardous; and the person of interest was, while interesting, not particularly harmful although terribly disruptive. He was admonished but released."  Gainer added, "This is the price of an open campus.  The suspect in the ricin case, Paul Kevin Curtis, was arrested at his home in Corinth, Mississippi, on Wednesday. He has been charged with making threats against the president and sending threatening letters, the Justice Department said Thursday.  Terrorists make us lose sight of the real dangers   In Oklahoma City, an unattended rental truck set off momentary panic Wednesday before police sounded the all-clear. The incident happened nearly 18 years ago to the day after Timothy McVeigh set off a devastating bomb outside a government building there, killing 168 people.   And then there's New York, where nervous residents of that normally steely city made nearly four times as many suspicious package calls the day after the Boston bombings than they did in a typical day the year before, New York police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Tuesday.  Vigilance is what authorities call it.  "Always looking for a way out" is what Linda Simmons of Douglasville, Georgia, calls it.  But it's not just Boston that's put her in that mindset. It's the September 11 terror attacks. The bloodbath last year at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. The Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings.  "All of it, everything that's happened," she said.  The reaction is understandable, said Michelle Majewski, a professor at Marian University in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.  The kind of mayhem unleashed Monday in Boston reminds us, she says, of things about which we'd rather not think.  "That we're all vulnerable," she said.  That vulnerability is something police recognize all too well.  Law enforcement stepped up security across the country in response to the Boston bombings. Hundreds of National Guard troops remained on duty in Boston on Wednesday, backing up police.  As did many other cities, perennial terror target New York ramped up its security measures and will keep them in place, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday, "until we learn more about what actually happened in Boston."  In London, authorities vowed to take another look at precautions for the big marathon scheduled there this weekend.  But security experts will tell you it's just not possible to prevent every bomb, every gunshot, every tragedyespecially not when it comes to large outdoor events, such as road races.  The impact of heightened security on travelers  "It's extremely challenging because it's not a secure environment," said police Cmdr. Noah Johnson of Tempe, Arizona, where an annual charity run in honor of slain Army Ranger Pat Tillman is scheduled for Saturday.  "We can't put fences around it; we can't put an officer every 2 feet," he said. "So we rely on every set of eyes out there."  So, as it often does in a free society, it comes down to us, to that word, to vigilance.  "Remain vigilant. You have to," said Mike Brooks, a law enforcement analyst for In Session and HLN and a former detective in the intelligence division for the Washington Metropolitan Police Department.  But security experts worry that down the road, many Americans may weary of maintaining such a high level of cautiousness.  "We as a country tend to lull ourselves into a false sense of security over the passage of time," said Andy Lamprey, vice president of the security firm Andrews International and a former Los Angeles Police Department senior SWAT supervisor.  The interest in the Boston terrorism case "will last for a few days and perhaps a week, and then it will become a distant memory for most people," he said.  It happened after the September 11 attacks. A month after them, nearly six in 10 Americans were worried that they or someone they loved would become a victim of a terrorist attack, according to a Gallup Poll at the time.  By 2011, the number had fallen to a little over one in threenearly what it was at its lowest point before the 2001 attacks.  "It's the old story about crying wolf and eventually people turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to it. They get weary of hearing it," Lamprey said. "It's very difficult to remain at that heightened state of awareness. You can't do it all the time."  In Oshkosh, Wisconsin, runners will head out this weekend for a half-marathon. Sure, race director Gloria West told CNN affiliate WBAY-TV, they'll think about security just that much more. Boston will be on their minds.  But they won't be deterred, she told the station.  "We want to send a message," she said. "We can't all go home and stay in our houses."  CNN's Miguel Marquez contributed to this report.  
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Tuesday ordered the makers of certain antibiotics to add a "black box" label warningthe FDA's strongestto alert patients of possible tendon ruptures and tendonitis.  Cipro is one of the drugs for which the FDA will require a "black box" label warning about tendon problems.  "The new language will strengthen the existing warnings," said Dr. Edward Cox, director of the FDA's Office of Antimicrobial Products.  The FDA is requiring the label warnings and a medication guide for fluoroquinolone drugs, which include Cipro, Levaquin, Avelox, Noroxin and Floxin.  The consumer group Public Citizen asked the FDA in August 2006 to put the "black box" warning on Cipro and other fluoroquinolones, and also to warn doctors. Earlier this year, Public Citizen filed a lawsuit to force the FDA to take those actions.  Public Citizen said Tuesday it was "pleased" with the FDA's order but added "there is still more that the FDA must do."  "The FDA is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions, such as tendon pain, so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture," the group said. "We are troubled that the FDA is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures."  When asked about the lawsuit and why it didn't order the "black box" label warning until now, Cox stressed that the FDA included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004, and updated the information last year.  Dr. Gupta explains more on antibiotic risks   "There has been ongoing work to update the labeling of the fluoroquinolone drug products," Cox said. "We have been working on this issue and making progress over time."  The companies that make the fluoroquinolone drugs will be required to submit label safety changes and the medication guide within 30 days of receiving the notification from the FDA or provide a reason why they do not believe such labeling changes are necessary, Cox said.  Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., which holds licenses for Cipro and Avelox, said it would make the changes requested by the FDA but defended the drugs as "well-tolerated and effective in all approved indications." Schering-Plough markets Cipro and Avelox in the United States under agreement with Bayer.  Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which markets Levaquin in the United States, also said it would abide by the FDA's request.  Merck & Co., the maker of Noroxin, said it, too, would update the drug's label. But Merck noted it has stopped promotion of Noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form.  Oscient Pharmaceuticals (Factive), Daiichi Sankyo (Floxin) and Dipomed (Proquin) did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.  The fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupturewhich is about 1 in 100,000by three to four times, according to the FDA's Dr. Renata Albrecht.  "This risk is further increased in those over age 60, in kidney, heart, and lung transplant recipients, and with use of concomitant steroid therapy," the FDA said in a statement.  Albrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendoncommonly their Achilles tendon.  "Sometimes it's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning," she said.  Normally, she added, that patients experience some pain or inflammation "a week or two before the patient will rupture."  Public Citizen, founded in 1971 by consumer activist Ralph Nader, said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between November 1997 and December 2007.  "Because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the FDA, the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher," the group said.  The FDA would only say that it has received "hundreds" of reports of tendon problems linked to fluoroquinolones, without being more specific, citing the ongoing lawsuit. But Cox said "the FDA continues to receive a considerable number of reports on tendon adverse effects."  Patients should stop taking fluoroquinolone antibiotics at the first sign of tendon pain, avoid exercise and contact their doctor, the FDA said.  Cox said the FDA would not require companies to send letters to doctors alerting them about the connection between tendon problems and the antibiotics.  "It is possible under REMS [Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy] to ask for a letter [to doctors]," Cox said. "Certainly for sponsors that would choose to go forward with a letter, we'll be happy to work with them."  
	 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ordered the makers of certain antibiotics to add'
An extensive internal review of the debacle at Penn State that left a child sex abuser in place on campus for years forever casts a shadow over a heroic figure at the school: Joe Paterno.  The report, the result of months of investigation, finds Paterno and a few other top officials not only showed a "callous and shocking disregard for child victims," but also helped "empower" assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky to attract victims, according to former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who spearheaded the review.  Review at Penn State: 'Total disgard' for the victims  Allegations have swirled around Paterno, the legendary head football coach who led Penn State to national prominence, since the scandal broke last year. Still, the official independent review deals a heavy blow to those who love college football and idolize Paterno.  Penn State trustee Kenneth Frazier, head of the committee addressing the Sandusky scandal, said it was clear that Paterno and other key university leaders exhibited "inexcusable failures" when it came to protecting children.  But, Frazier said, figuring the coach's legacy will be a bit more complicated.  Paterno defended Penn State in letter before his death  "There is a lot about his life that's worth emulating," he said. "You have to measure every human by the good they've done, the bad they've done. I don't think any of us wants to be measured by the worst things we've ever been done in our life."  Following the report's release Thursday, many people took to social media to condemn the aura of support that has long surrounded Paternoand the students who rioted in November after he was fired.  " 'JoePa' participated in a cover-up to protect a child rapist and allowed it to continue," Facebook user Ted Gannon wrote Thursday on Penn State's Facebook page. He added that "there's a statue of him on campus. What on earth are people being taught at that university?"  But some people in State Collegea small town that revolves largely around the big universityinsisted Paterno, who died in January, has not been judged fairly.  "I think from the very beginning, Paterno was made a scapegoat," said local resident Kathy Gburuk. The football program itself, she added, "really had nothing to do with this."  Reactions to review flood social media  Student John Zang said he believes "there is some merit" to the idea that Paterno has been scapegoated. But Zang praised the report, including what he described as its calls for changing the culture at Penn State.  "It's hard for a lot of people" at Penn State to hear Paterno's name "not used in the best of light," he added.  Lee Rubin, who played for Penn State between 1991 and 1993, told CNN shortly after the report came out that what he heard of it had not changed his opinion of the legendary coach, though he had not yet read it.  "I think in fairness it needs to be read. It needs to be digested to be responded to," Rubin said. "I think the accusations are very direct, they are very clear, and it would be unwise to try to defend any wrongdoing. I just think there needs to be an opportunity to respond to those accusations."  Weeks before his death, Paterno himself wrote an op-ed that was never published. In it, he generally defended his actions and the university.  At a glance: Key players in Penn State report  "Regardless of anyone's opinion of my actions or the actions of the handful of administration officials in this matter, the fact is nothing alleged is an indictment of football," he wrote.  Freeh, in his report, notes that Paterno once told a reporter, "I didn't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was. So I backed away and turned it over to some other people, people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did. It didn't work out that way."  But "it is more reasonable to conclude" that he and former President Graham Spanier, former Vice President Gary Schultz and former Athletic Director Tim Curley, in order to avoid bad publicity, "repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to Sandusky's child abuse from the authorities, the Board of Trustees, Penn State community, and the public at large," Freeh wrote in a statement accompanying the 267-page review.  Evidence shows that Paterno was made aware of a 1998 criminal investigation of Sandusky relating to suspected sexual misconduct with a young boy in a Penn State football locker room shower, the report says. But Paterno "failed to take any action, even though Sandusky had been a key member of his coaching staff for almost 30 years, and had an office just steps away from Mr. Paterno's.  January: Paterno remembered at public memorial  "At the very least, Mr. Paterno could have alerted the entire football staff, in order to prevent Sandusky from bringing another child into the Lasch Building," where the incident took place.  Paterno and the others also failed to alert the Board of Trustees, Freeh's statement says.  "None of them even spoke to Sandusky about his conduct. In short, nothing was done and Sandusky was allowed to continue with impunity."  Once, in February, 2001, the four men decided they would report the incident to the Department of Public Welfare; but Paterno then had a conversation with Curley, and the men agreed not to do so, Freeh wrote.  After then-Penn State graduate assistant Mike McQueary reported to Paterno that he had seen what appeared to be a sexual attack involving Sandusky and a boy in a shower room in February 2001, Paterno responded to McQueary, "You did what you had to do. It is my job now to figure out what we want to do," according to Freeh's report.  "To his credit, Mr. Paterno stated on November 9, 2011, 'With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more.' " Freeh wrote.  Freeh also said the team that carried out the investigation believes Paterno would have spoken to them before he died, were it not for his declining health.  The Paterno family released a statement saying it was reviewing the report. "From the moment this crisis broke, Joe Paterno supported a comprehensive, fair investigation. He always believed, as we do, that the full truth should be uncovered."  Despite scandal, Penn State raises more than $200 million  The probe found that Paterno "reported what he was told about the 2001 incident to Penn State authorities"meaning Curley, Schultz, and Spanier"and he believed it would be fully investigated," the family wrote.  "One great risk in this situation is a replaying of events from the last 15 years or so in a way that makes it look obvious what everyone must have known and should have done. The idea that any sane, responsible adult would knowingly cover up for a child predator is impossible to accept. The far more realistic conclusion is that many people didn't fully understand what was happening and underestimated or misinterpreted events. Sandusky was a great deceiver. He fooled everyonelaw enforcement, his family, coaches, players, neighbors, University officials, and everyone at Second Mile," the charity program for children that Sandusky ran.  Sandusky was convicted in June of sexually abusing young boys over a 15-year period. He maintains his innocence.  "Joe Paterno wasn't perfect," the family statement said. "He made mistakes and he regretted them." But if he "had understood what Sandusky was, a fear of bad publicity would not have factored into his actions."  The family statement acknowledged, "It can be argued that Joe Paterno should have gone further," but it deflected blame from him, saying Paterno assumed others were "doing their jobs."  LZ Granderson: Mourning Joe Paterno, a flawed hero  The College Football Hall of Fame, which inducted Paterno in 2007, says in his biography, "No coach has been as synonymous with one school as has Penn State's Joe Paterno." He was a five-time National Coach of the Year.  "More important than all of the wins and titles he has accumulated may be his legacy with the influence he has had on his players, Penn State Students and alumni. Paterno has generously contributed millions to the school and its academic programs. The National Football Foundation has honored him with the Distinguished American Award in 1992 and the Gold Medal Award in 2006."  The organization did not immediately respond to request for comment Thursday from CNN.  John Tecce, a Penn State student who has sat in the first row for every Penn State football game throughout his entire college career, cautioned against letting the scandal, and specifically the damage to Paterno's reputation, cast a pall over the entire university.  "I received my diploma in May, and it says 'The Pennsylvania State University,' not 'Joe Paterno University,' " he said. "The university is not defined by one name or the actions of a few."  Karen Peetz, chairwoman of the board of trustees, said the question of whether the university should honor Paterno "is a very sensitive topic."  "We believe that with the report's findings, this is something that will need to continue to be discussed within the entire university community," she said.  Penn State community still admires Paterno, wants to move forward  
 Investigatorsasked to determine if a possible new clue is linked to the disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Hollowaynow hope to learn Thursday whether a jawbone found on an Aruban beach belongs to an animal or a human.  Results from the testing of the bone were expected to be returned Wednesday, but investigators were held up by a technical delay.  If the bone is human, authorities will then attempt to find out through DNA testing whether it belongs to Holloway, who was last seen on the island in 2005.  It is being evaluated at the Netherlands Forensic Institute in The Hague, Netherlands, Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken said this week.  Holloway's dental records were sent to the forensic institute on Wednesday, the FBI said.  "We provided her dental records to the Dutch authorities. They were sent electronically," said FBI spokesman Paul Daymond. The information-sharing is "what we do, nothing out of the ordinary," he said.  The Holloway family had told HLN's "Nancy Grace" that the records were sent to the Hague.  The length of testing can vary, but normally takes about a week, according to a representative of the institute.  The findings will be sent back to the prosecutor's office in Aruba, which will decide whether to make the results public.  Part of a jawbone with a tooth was found on Friday by an American tourist near the Phoenix Hotel, a large resort on the western side of Aruba, Blanken said.  Contacted by CNN, the hotel referred questions to local authorities.  The prosecutor said the bone was initially examined by a forensic expert in Aruba, who determined the bone was from a young woman. But Blanken cautioned the final determination would be made by the forensic institute in the Netherlands.  Holloway was 18 when she was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with Joran van der Sloot and two other men. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama.  Van der Sloot was detained twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance but never charged.  He is now awaiting trial in Lima, Peru, on a murder charge in the death of Peruvian student Stephany Flores. Her body was found in May in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot. The two were seen entering the room on a surveillance camera.  Van der Sloot, 23, is also charged with wire fraud and extortion in Alabama for allegedly attempting to extort more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body.  HLN's Rupa Mikkilineni, CNN's Susan Candiotti, Laura Perez Maestro, Brian Walker and CNN Radio's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.  
	 'Joe Paterno\'s legacy is a "total disgard" for Penn State'
On the evening of Whitney Houston's death, renowned recording artist Tony Bennett told the audience of Clive Davis' Beverly Hills party, "First it was Michael Jackson, then it was Amy Winehouse, and now, the magnificent Whitney Houston. I'd like to have every gentleman and lady in this room commit themselves to get our government to legalize drugsso they'll have to get it through a doctor, not to some gangsters who just sell it under the table."  Bennett's idiotic comments were followed closely by the often original, but in this case mistaken, Arianna Huffington.  On Monday morning's edition of "CNN Starting Point With Soledad O'Brien," she agreed with Bennett: "The point I think is absolutely fairthat the war on drugs has failed, and we are not acknowledging it. We are spending over $50 billion a year fighting a war that has become a war on our own people."  First, we do not know the immediate cause of Houston's death. But we do know that she had a long and public struggle with drugs, both legal and illegal. But legalizing drugs and making them more readily available would not have saved her life, or the life of Michael Jackson, or the thousands of other drug-related deaths each year.  Lest Tony Bennett forget, Michael Jackson died from acute propofol intoxication administered to him by a doctor.  Amy Winehouse died from alcohol poisoninga legal, easily available substance.  A fatal combination of painkillers, sleeping pills and anti-depressantsall legal prescription drugskilled Heath Ledger.  Brittany Murphy died from multiple drug intoxications (only prescription and over-the-counter medications according to the medical exam) combined with pneumonia.  And Anna Nicole Smith overdosed on prescription and over-the-counter drugs.  All these drugs are legal and prescribed by doctors. Contrary to what Tony Bennett and other legalizers would like to think, legalization does not prevent the abuse and misuse of drugs. In fact, it accelerates it.  According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, prescription drug abuse is the nation's fastest-growing drug problem. In 2007, there were 28,000 deaths from prescription drug overdoses. This is five times higher than the number in 1990. More people die in America every year from prescription drug abuse (i.e., legal and available drugs) than from heroin and cocaine combined.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the number of deaths from prescription narcotics increased fourfold over the past 10 years. This coincided with a fourfold increase in the number of prescriptions written for powerful painkillers. Legalization increases supply and when you increase supply, you increase the use and misuse of deadly drugs.  As for Bennett's envy of Amsterdam, he should realize that its legalization experiment has backfired. With the legalization of marijuana came an increase in drug addictions and dependency followed by illegal drug trafficking, human trafficking and crime. After a rapid influx of organized crime, the Netherlands has announced that it will ban foreigners from the country's pot shops starting in 2013.  Drug decriminalization in Portugal has also been a failure.  As of 2007, Portugal was still the country with the most cases of injected drug related AIDS, and it was the only European country to show a significant increase in homicides from 2001 to 2006.  "With 219 deaths by drug 'overdose' a year, Portugal has one of the worst records, reporting more than one death every two days. Along with Greece, Austria and Finland, Portugal is one of the countries that recorded an increase in drug overdose by over 30% in 2005," according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.  Bennett and Huffington's misguided solutions would result in more tragic deaths like Houston's. Illicit drugs are not harmful because they are illegal, they are illegal precisely because they are harmful. It is my hope that in the national dialogue surrounding Houston's death, our country's loudest voices would speak honestly and seriously about the drug problems in America.  In the 1980s and '90s, the U.S. beat back the cocaine and heroine epidemics, not by legalization or decriminalization, but by tough law enforcement, strong prevention and education programs and public outcry. You could hardly watch TV without seeing the Partnership For a Drug-Free America's famous "This is your brain on drugs" advertisements. If we are to be successful today, we must reignite that same national effort.  Whitney Houston's mother, Cissy Houston, understood the seriousness of drug abuse. In a 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Houston recalled how her mother showed up one day at her doorstep with sheriff's officers and a court order in a drug intervention.  "(My mother) says, 'I have a court (injunction) here,' " Houston said. "Either you do it my way, or we're just not going to do this at all. We are both going to go on TV, and you're going to retire.'"  If more Americans, celebrities in particular, spoke and acted like Cissy Houston, rather than like Bennett or Huffington, fewer Americans would be victims to drug addiction.

 Soupy Sales, a comedian from the golden era of television, died Thursday. He was 83.  The funny man seen many times on popular game shows died at a New York hospice, said Paul Dver, Sales' longtime friend and manager.  "We have lost a comedy American icon," Dver said. "I feel the personal loss, and I also feel the magic that he had around him being gone. That's a much more severe loss than a loss of a friend."  Sales was known for his long-running children's show "Lunch With Soupy Sales," which started in 1953 and began his trademark slapstick pie-throwing antics. The comedy show featured skits that culminated in Sales getting walloped with pies in the face. What are your memories of Sales?  "Soupy was the last of the great TV comics when you talk about Ernie Kovacs, Red Skelton, right down to Howdy Doody," Dver said. "But it was bigger than that, because he used a children's format aimed at the kids and then he would forget he was doing a kids' show and do a wild, unrehearsed, wacky improv for a half-hour every day for 15 years."  He could also inflame the authorities. One New Year's Day, upset at being asked to work, he asked his youthful audience to send him those "green pieces of paper" from their parents' wallets. Though he didn't receive muchhe told The New York Times he received only a few dollarshe was suspended for a week for the prank.  Later in his career, he was a regular on TV game shows, such as "Hollywood Squares," "To Tell the Truth" and "What's My Line?"  Sales recently fell backstage at a local Emmy awards show in New York and developed serious ailments after that, Dver said.

Manchester United returned to the top of the English Premier League with a 3-1 victory over in-form Tottenham on Saturday but the champions' title hopes suffered a blow with the news that top scorer Wayne Rooney may miss the rest of the season.  The England striker sat out the home win, which put United two points clear of Chelsea, with a groin injury suffered in training and he may miss the final two matches of the season.  England coach Fabio Capello will be hoping that United take no risks with the 34-goal forward, who will be one of his key players at the World Cup in South Africa starting in mid-June.  "I think he'll probably take two to three weeks to recover," United manager Alex Ferguson told match broadcaster Sky. "We'll try to get him back, he'll obviously be desperate to get back himself. We'll just have to wait and see."  Earlier this month, Rooney made a sooner-than-expected return from an ankle injury to play in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal against Bayern Munich, then missed the 0-0 draw with Blackburn before a below-par outing in the 1-0 win over Manchester City that kept his side in the title race.  United face mid-table Sunderland and Stoke in the climax to the season as the club seek a fourth successive league crown, while Chelsea hosts Stoke on Sunday before a trip to Liverpool and a home clash with lowly Wigan.  Tottenham, who upset third-placed Arsenal and Chelsea in the two preceding matches, have not beaten United since 1989 and have not defeated one of the "big four" away from home in 66 matches.  Harry Redknapp's team still retained fourth place in the table as Manchester City drew 0-0 at Arsenal in Saturday's late match.  The Londoners looked like matching United at Old Trafford when defender Ledley King equalized in the 70th minute, but Portugal midfielder Nani snatched victory for the hosts with a delightful chip on 81 and then won a penalty for Ryan Giggs' second spot-kick of the game five minutes later.  The 36-year-old Giggs had never scored a penalty in his near 600-game career for United, but coolly took over Rooney's duties in the 58th minute after Benoit Assou-Akotto brought down Patrice Evra in the box.  United lost Evra to the lingering effects of his pre-match illness and winger Antonio Valencia went off with injury, while Spurs rallied with the return of England midfielder Aaron Lennon from long-term injury as a substitute.  Defender King headed in Gareth Bale's corner as United fullback Rafael strayed from his position on the post and could not clear the ball to give the visitors hope of a point.  But Nani raced onto substitute Federico Macheda's pass to beat goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes with an exquisite finish, and the Brazilian was again beaten by Giggs after a clumsy challenge from behind by Wilson Palacios.  Manchester City trail Tottenham by a point in the battle for the fourth Champions League place, with the two teams to meet in their penultimate game of the season on May 5.  City boss Roberto Mancini surprisingly left Emmanuel Adebayor on the bench after the Togo striker's ill-advised goal celebrations in front of his former club's fans when the teams last met in the league in September.  Adebayor made an impact when he came on in the second half, but the match was most notable for a season-ending shoulder injury suffered by City's Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given that allowed Gunnar Nielsen to become the first Faroe Isander to play in the Premier League.  The 23-year-old was largely untested as Arsenal's faint title hopes were finally extinguished, with the Londoners now seven points behind United with two matches left.  Nielsen may have to fill in for the rest of the season, with Given's deputy Stuart Taylor injured and England international Joe Hart on loan at Birmingham.  City next take on sixth-placed Aston Villa, who can keep their own Champions League hopes alive with victory at home to Midlands rivals Birmingham on Sunday.  West Ham moved six points clear of the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over fellow strugglers Wigan that keeps Gianfranco Zola's team in the top flight for another season.  Captain Scott Parker struck a 77th-minute winner from long range as West Ham recovered from an early own-goal by United States defender Jonathan Spector, with Brazilian striker Ilan and Czech midfielder Radoslav Kovac putting the London side 2-1 up at halftime.  Colombia striker Hugo Rodallega leveled seven minutes after the interval with a bundled effort as Victor Moses flicked on a cross from first-goal provider Ben Watson, but Kovac headed against the bar before midfielder Parker celebrated his return from suspension with a fine winner.  The result sent third-bottom Hull down to the second division after the Yorkshire side lost 1-0 in an ill-tempered home clash with Sunderland that saw both teams reduced to 10 men.  Darren Bent put Sunderland ahead in the seventh minute from close range after strike partner Kenwyne Jones headed Alan Hutton's cross into his path for the England World Cup hopeful's 25th goal this season.  Hull should have leveled after the club's former defender Michael Tuner brought down Geovanni, but Jimmy Bullard hit the post with his penalty attempt.  Hutton was sent off just before halftime following an ugly exchange with Hull striker Jozy Altidore, which saw the Scot receive a headbutt after throwing the ball in the face of the United States international, who was also red-carded.  Wolverhampton Wanderers will be safe for a second season in the Premier League if fellow promoted side Burnley fail to beat Liverpool on Sunday, having moved eight points clear of the second-bottom side with a 1-1 draw at home to Blackburn.  Blackburn captain Ryan Nelsen put the visitors ahead in the 28th minute, with the New Zealand defender diverting in Morten Gamst Pedersen's corner, but substitute Sylvain Ebanks-Blake headed an 81st minute equalizer from Stephen Ward's cross.  Relegated bottom club Portsmouth came from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw at Bolton, as Ivory Coast striker Aruna Dindane netted a second-half double for the FA Cup finalists to cancel out first-half efforts by Kevin Davies and Ivan Klasnic.  
 Zhuhai, Guangdong Province Zhuhai's Air Show has always been a venue for surprises, usually first-time showings of advanced Chinese military hardware.  China's pathologically secretive defense industry normally shows nothing official of its weapons programs to anyone, which makes the biennial Zhuhai expo the only chance to see what its weapons makers have been up to.  Much has been written in the past few years about China's defense sector developing increasingly more capable weapons systems that approach the capability of their U.S. and European analogues.  Some Chinese weapons, such as a full range of anti-ship and air-to-surface missiles, seem to show that its militarythe People's Liberation Army (PLA)is equipped to challenge U.S. Navy carrier battle groups and potentially deny the U.S. the ability to operate in certain areas of the Pacific. But questions remain about how battle-ready the PLA is and whether it can function in a modern, network-centric warfare environment.  Today's battlefield operates on the premise that autonomy should be pushed down to the lowest leveleven down to the man in the fieldbecause time is of the essence. Getting inside of the enemy's "decision loop" is the key to victory. But, giving individual units the ability to make their own tactical decisions without their orders being delivered from several layers up the chain of command is an anathema to the "control uber alles" mentality of the Chinese leadership.  In terms of new weapons, the number one attraction at Zhuhai this year was the new Shenyang FC-31 fighter.  It has generated a good deal of excitement as it's the first time a new Chinese military aircraft has been unveiled while still in the early stages of developmentwe usually have to wait until after they start serving in the PLA's air force.  The FC-31 is designed to look like a stealth fighter aircraft in the class of the American Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.  It is also the second, but smaller, stealth-type design to be developed by China. The FC-31's "Big Brother," the Chengdu J-20, first flew in January 2011 but has been shrouded in secrecy ever since.  The FC-31 "looks" stealthy and its shape mimics that of the F-35 in some respects.  But it is impossible to tell just how successful the Shenyang design team has been in developing an aircraft with a low radar cross section without knowing the materials used, the placement of the engines inside the aircraft, and how well the heat signature from the engines has been suppressed by the design of the exhaust nozzle section.  Like other PLAAF fighter aircraft, the FC-31 is powered by Russian-made jet engines, in this case two Klimov RD-93 models, which are a specialized variant of the same engine that powers the famous Mikoyan "MiG-29."  There have been rumors that a team of renegade designers from the Mikoyan bureau in Moscow assisted Shenyang in the development of the aircraft, but a senior MiG official stated "no, as far as I know they [the Chinese] completed this design themselves, and they seem to have done a good job on their own."  The MiG official may be correct.  An aircraft of this type designed with Russian assistance would probably perform better.  The FC-31's flight routine shows that it "bleeds" too much energyso when it enters into a turn it begins to lose altitude. Even during straight and level flight the pilot has to engage the engine's afterburners in order to keep the aircraft from sinking to a lower altitude. These are defects in the aircraft's aerodynamic design that a Russian design team would not have made.  Western aerospace analysts point out that the FC-31 flown at Zhuhai is a "clean" jet in that it is not armed, which means that an aircraft configured for a real mission and fitted with weapons would be even heavier and would perform even worse.  So, why has the PLAAF chosen to exhibit an aircraft that is either overweight, underpowered or both?  It could be an oblique signal to Washington timed to coincide with President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing for the APEC summit. The underlying message: "China is stronger than you think."  This would not be the first such example of China trying to use its defense industry to flex its muscles.  In January 2011, when the J-20 first flew, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was in Beijing for an official visit.  His read was that the timing of the two events was in no way coincidental.  Unfortunately for the PLA, the gesture falls flat.  Many would have been more impressed by the FC-31 in photos posted on Chinese websites than after seeing it actually fly at the air show.  Looks can be deceiving, as they say.

Atlanta The day before Susan Bennett came out as the original voice of Siri in the United States, she lost her iPhone. Siriously.  But that's just one smile-inducing twist in a less-than-two-week journey that's left this suburban Atlanta voiceover actor "gobsmacked" and feeling like "some strange tropical bird" on display, she said. "I had no idea this would be such a big deal."  On October 4, exactly two years after Apple's virtual "assistant" was introduced to the masses with the release of the iPhone 4S, CNN revealed her identity. Hours after our in-depth story was published online, she was sitting on the New York set of CNN's "New Day" morning show.  And a new day it was for Bennett, whowithout her phonehad no idea how much her world was about to change. At her airport gate to head home from New York, she got a sense. A man who kept staring at her finally approached with a question: "Are you that Siri person?"  Coming forward, in itself, had been cathartic. She'd grappled with the idea, mostly at the urging of her son, ever since she was surprised to find out she was the voice behind Siri. The recordings used for the Siri voice had been laid down by Bennett in 2005, long before anyone outside of Apple knew that something called an iPhone was even on the horizon.  "I can't tell you how freeing it was to make that decision," she said. "I'd been torturing myself for two years."  After a whirlwind 10 days of travel and newfound exposure, Bennett sat down over coffee and talked about what her life has been like since she took the leap from anonymity.  The media frenzy  To say that she got slammed with media requests would be an understatement. By the time Bennett got back to Atlanta from her morning TV appearance on CNN's "New Day," between 400 and 500 e-mails were waiting for her. Most of them were requests for interviews. Meanwhile, her husband, Rick Hinkle, sat at home fielding phone calls as they poured in and asking, through the front door, for a local TV crew to leave.  "I thought I might get a couple e-mails. Maybe the (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) would want to do a little story," Bennett said. "This is craziness."  15 of Siri's best (and worst) jokes  The requests have been global, coming from places as far-flung as the United Arab Emirates, New Zealand, Ireland and Israel. She stared at what was in front of her, knowing she was in over her head. She had no idea where to begin.  Fortunately, a hot-shot publicist in Los Angeles, Monique Moss of Integrated PR, was prepared to take over. Bennett would quickly go on to read a Top 10 list for David Letterman and make appearances on "The Queen Latifah Show" and HLN's "Showbiz Tonight." She's done interviews with a handful of media outlets, including USA Today and the Los Angeles Times, and hit the radio morning show circuit: 18 programs in three hours alone.  A new stable of handlers  The publicist is just one person helping Bennett navigate her new normal. She's also landed Wes Stevens of VOX Inc., one of the top voiceover agents in the nation and someone she hopes will help her reach her ultimate dream: to voice a cartoon character.  Bennett doesn't want to discuss details but said after last week, that dream finally feels possible.  And then there's her son, Cameron Bennett, a photographer in Los Angeles. On a four-day trip Bennett recently took to L.A., her son played chauffeur, schlepping his sleep-deprived mother from meeting to meeting. He also has stepped in to manage his mom's growing social media presence, something she'd never focused on before. And that's how her new Twitter handle, @SiriouslySusan, was born.  Finding comfort in the spotlight  When asked to appear on CNN's "New Day," Bennett was at first reticent. Years earlier, she'd done on-camera work, mostly for corporate videos. But in a world where appearanceand, by association, agematters, she found herself being phased out.  As a voiceover actor, she doesn't have to worry about looks and can wear what she wants. There's tremendous comfort in that.  So the decision to step in front of live cameras wasn't immediate for her. But she then realized that coming out as the voice of Siri had been the big hurdle. That was the scary part. Once she did walk onto the set of "New Day," she was surprised by how comfortable she was.  "All of a sudden, that old memory of how to behave on camera came out," said Bennett, who declines to give her age. "I wasn't nervous at all."  The caked-on makeup, though, she can do without. By the time she got back from her L.A. jaunt, she said, her skinwhat with all the makeup, the drier air, the lack of sleepfelt like it had aged 10 years. She got home and said all she wanted to do was face-plant into a tub of moisturizer.  Well, that and sleep. Over four days in L.A., this night owl thinks she got no more than 18 hours of sleep.  "I felt really proud of myself that I was able to do everything I was asked to do," she said. "It was exciting but also exhausting."  Unexpectedand movingmessages  In the past 10 days, Bennett has heard from old friends, people she hasn't been in touch with for decades. And while most close family members were privy to her Siri secret, some distant relatives were not, which has meant some reconnecting that way, too.  Strangers have written, begging her to record their outgoing messages for them. And wannabe voiceover actors seeking advice have reached out to Bennett, who's trying to make a point to answer each and every e-mailwhich at last count numbered more than 600.  But the most moving responses have come from members of the blind community. Bennett has long been a voice of many TTS, or text-to-speech, services, beyond the technology used to create Siri.  For the first time, she's received thank-you notes from people she's served, people who've relied on her but didn't know her name until now. Their common message: "Thanks for enabling us to do all we do," she said.  One writer specified that she'd helped him work his computer, use his phone and "read" textbooks. Realizing the tangible difference her voice has made in other people's lives made her cry.  "This can be a thankless business," she said. "It's so nice to know my voice is being used in a good way."  What's next  Bennett feels blessed to love what she does in Atlanta. She came home to her loving guitarist husband, her kitties, the lush trees and her quiet home. She's back with her community of colleagues, musicians and friends she couldn't appreciate more.  Between resting her voice from all the recent attention, she's getting back to workserving the same clients, recording in her home booth, laughing with the engineers who feel like family.  She doesn't expect this flood of attention to last forever. She suspects that most of her "15 minutes of fame" already came and went. If she continues doing what she does, she says, she'll be fine.  But she's open and excited to see what might happen next.  "Life is change," she said. "It's inevitable."  There's talk of a book deal and a speaking tour, two ideas that make her shake her head in amused disbelief. She's already been asked to give a keynote address at a big telecommunications conference next year. And if other new jobs come out of this experiencelike a cartoon offer, perhapsshe would, of course, be thrilled.  "I'm grateful for all of it," she said. "It's absolutely surreal."  But, Bennett insisted, none of this has changed or will change who she is.  She looked down at her new iPhone 5S, the one she can't seem to figure out"Why can't I get e-mail?"and headed back to real life.  
 Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer continued their preparations for the first grand slam of the season with contrasting victories Friday at tournaments in Doha and Brisbane.  World number one Nadal has never won the Qatar Open and stands just one match away from achieving that ambition.  But he was fully extended by German qualifier Peter Gojowczyk before prevailing in three sets.  Earlier, Federer dropped just two games on the Gold Coast as he dismissed Marinko Matosevic 6-1 6-1 in just 58 minutes to reach the last four.  Nadal, who is the only seed left in the tournament after the shock departures of Andy Murray and David Ferrer, could have been headed that way as he dropped the opening set to Gojowczk, who had enjoyed a dream run to his first ATP Tour semifinal.  But the Spaniard hit back to level in typical style and closed out the match 4-6 6-2 6-3 in just under two hours.  "The positive thing is I am in the finals the first week of the season without arriving here with big preparation," Nadal told the official ATP Tour website.  "Without playing my best, I was able to find a solution. It's true that I finished the match playing better than what I started," he added.  Nadal is likely to have his work cut out in Saturday's final at the Khalifa Tennis Complex, with France's Gael Monfils his opponent.  Monfils, something of a Doha specialist and twice a losing finalist, showed his quality with a straight sets 6-3 6-2 win over Florian Mayer of Germany in a little under an hour.  He has twice beaten Nadal in the same tournament and showed enough against Mayer to suggest he could repeat the hat-trick.  Federer is playing in Brisbane for the first time in his glittering career and treated the crowd on the Pat Pat Rafter Arena to a tennis master class against his Australian opponent.  He was briefly troubled in the opening game, facing three break points then took firm control.  The top seed will next play France's Jeremy Chardy, who beat another Australian, wildcard Sam Groth, 7-5 6-4.  The second semifinal will be between second seed Kei Nishikori of Japan and home favorite Lleyton Hewitt.  Nishikori ground out a three set win over Croatia's Marin Cili, while Hewitt continued his fine run with a straight sets dismissal of Romanian qualifier Marius Copil, 6-4, 6-2.

A California lawyer is facing license suspension for alleged deceptive advertising by Photoshopping herself into cozy pictures with politicians and celebrities on her official website.  The California State Bar Court is recommending Svitlana Sangary be suspended from practicing law for six months, after an investigation showed her website featured fake publicity photos of her next to President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Kim Kardashian, Ellen DeGeneres and others.  The California Bar Association says Sangary's suspension does not go into effect until approved by the California Supreme Court and is recommending two-and-a-half years of probation after the six-month suspension.  On Friday, CNN contacted Sangary for comment, and she said she would call back shortly. "I will tell you much more later," she said. Later in the day, she declined additional immediate comment.  She ultimately responded in a lengthy email Monday that defended her position, but did not flatly deny doctoring the photos.  Misleading the public  Sangary faked many or all of the photos by taking original celebrity pictures and then overlaying her own image, the state bar court found.  The ruling said because the "photographs were part of an advertisement and solicitation for future work ... they were false, deceptive, and intended to confuse, deceive and mislead the public."  But high-profile legal analyst and celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos does not think an attorney's photoshop frenzy is troublesome or worth suspension.  "If that kind of puffery is actionable by the state bar, you are going to put the entire membership of state bar out of business," Geragos told CNN. "There is no greater group of self-promoters than lawyers, and puffery goes with the territory."  Court documents say Sangary answered her notice of disciplinary charges with a "16-page soliloquy with little to no rational connection to the charges."  A "sweet sixteen" response  As an example, court papers cited a portion of Sangary's response, which she wrote referring to herself in the third person: "There is a popular expression, 'sweet sixteen'. The foregoing 16 pages can be characterized as bitter-sweet sixteen, in Sangary's view. It goes without saying as to why they are bitter. Can one envision the acts in the civil arena, more unseemly than the ones described above?  "Svitlana Sangary came to this country in her twenties, with nothing, and married another immigrant, who also had nothing ... Sangary's American dream has come true, as she has been able to achieve a point wherein now, in her thirties, Sangary is a prominent donor and philanthropist, supporting important social causes, who had recently received the email from President Obama, with the subject line 'I need your help today', asking Svitlana Sangary for an additional donation."  Sangary made similar statements in her Monday response to CNN saying the pictures "represent the doors that an underdog, an immigrant woman can walk through, and the heights the first generation American can climb."  "I put blood, sweat and tears to finally reach a point in my life when I became a major donor and devoted supporter of numerous charitable and political causes, and got invited to the events where I was blessed with the opportunity to socialize and have my pictures taken with the talented and successful people, who have been inspiring me for my whole life, whom I admire and look up to."  Sangary added: "Please take a look at all my pictures, consult any computer guru if you like, and decide for yourself whether these pictures are real, authentic or Photoshopped."  Culpable of four counts  Stan Goldman, a Loyola Law School of Los Angeles professor with a background in legal ethics, argues lawyers' websites and photoshopping should be controlled by the state bar so that clients can make rational choices.  "You may not be misrepresenting law school, grades or experience, but this (attorney's website) is untrue," Goldman said. "It's suggesting you are more well-connected, more important, more successful and talented than you are."  State Bar Court Judge Donald F. Miles found Sangary culpable of four total counts: deceptive advertising, two counts of failing to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation, and one count of failing to promptly release a client file.  Sangary's website says she's a Pepperdine Law School graduate and her offices "concentrate on trial practice and civil litigation, specializing in all types of litigation and dispute resolution in various forums."  CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.  
 In South Korea, the launch of "StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty" is more than just a follow-up to one of the PC industry's top-selling gamesit could shake up what many see as the North Asian country's national sport.  In high-tech South Koreawhich has one of the highest broadband penetration rates in the worldthe StarCraft video game series has spawned devotion more akin to professional sports teams.  Indeed, video game players there can get lucractive contracts from professional teams with corporate sponsorships. Games of large tournaments are broadcast live on television in South Korea.  "In Korea, a lot of factors came together to make it a big thing," professional gamer Greg Fields told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout.  The first StarCraft game, produced by Blizzard Entertainment in Irvine, California, came out in 1998 when the South Korean economy was melting down during the Asian Financial Crisis.  "It was in the middle of an economic recession and (StarCraft) was easy, cheap entertainment. It really took over and just captivated a nation," said Fields, a 20-year-old New Jersey native recruited two years ago to play StarCraft for the South Korean team CJ Entus.  In a nod to the game's popularity in South Korea,  Blizzard first announced plans for StarCraft II at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational in Seoul in May 2007.  About 90 percent of South Korean households are connected to high-speed broadband and the nation has some 25,000 internet cafes, which took in $600 million last year, according to government figures. The gaming market is expected to be worth $5.5 billion this year with a 17 percent growth rate, according to the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA).  StarCraft II was first released Tuesday in South Korea and other Asian nations. The original game sold about 11 million copies worldwide .  While gamers in South Korea are lining up to get copies of the new title, StarCraft II could be a game changer in the country's professional circuit, Fields said.  "In StarCraft II, the leagues aren't established yet, they're all building upit's going to be huge, but we don't know how long it will take, how huge it will be, whether (existing teams) will be good at the game or not," Fields said.

 World No. 1 Rafael Nadal will face longtime rival Roger Federer in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters on Saturday in a rematch of the event's past two title matches.  Defending champion Nadal crushed fellow left-hander Michael Llodra 6-2 6-2 on Friday, needing just 75 minutes to clinch his 35th successive victory on clay against a French player appearing in his first top-level quarterfinal on the surface.  Federer, who beat the Spaniard in the 2009 final, later overcame Robin Soderlingwho inflicted Nadal's last defeat on clay at that year's French Open.  The world No. 3 triumphed 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 against the Swedish fifth seed in one hour 42 minutes  After successive titles in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, Nadal's progress has been simpler this week following a third-round walkover when rejuvenated former world No. 4 Juan Martin del Potro pulled out with a hip injury.  "Today it was quite good, especially here with the altitude it's a little bit more complicated because it's more difficult to go over him," Nadal told the ATP Tour website after conceding only eight points on his serve and breaking Llodra four times.  "It's a bit more difficult with the serve. I felt quite good on the court, I served well. In the second set there were quite a lot of rallies and not so many in the first, and I think I played really well."  Friday's opening quarterfinal saw Thomaz Bellucci continued his giantkilling run by ousting seventh seed Tomas Berdych, beating the 2010 Wimbledon runner-up 7-6 (7-2) 6-3.  The 23-year-old became the first Brazilian since Gustavo Kuerten in 2003 to reach the last-four stage in the Spanish capital as he followed up his earlier shock win over British fourth seed Andy Murray.  Bellucci, ranked 36th, reached the semis of a Masters 1000 event for the first time.  "Of course, yesterday's match gave me a lot of confidence that I was needing," he said. "I was losing some games and wasn't playing very well, but yesterday I played my best tennis.  "Today I had a lot of confidence on the court and I managed to get a victory. I played well and I have got even more confidence for tomorrow's match."  Bellucci next faces either world No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who is unbeaten in 29 consecutive matches this year, or Spanish sixth seed David Ferrerthe losing finalist in Monte Carlo and Barcelona last month.  "They are losing very few matches, but they are not invincible, they can also lose," Bellucci said ahead of the duo's clash in Friday's late match.  Germany's Julia Gorges continued her fine form in the women's event in Madrid, with the Stuttgart champion beating Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to reach the semifinals.  She won 6-4 6-2 to follow up her second successive win over world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki and set up a clash with fourth seed Victoria Azarenka.  The Belarusian battled past unseeded Czech Lucie Safarova 6-3 3-6 6-2 to move to within one win of claiming the No. 4 rankingwhich no woman from her country has done before.  Her last meeting with Gorges ended in disappointment in Stuttgart last month when the 21-year-old Azarenka had to retire hurt with a shoulder injury after winning the first set.  Chinese sixth seed Li Na also went through to the last four, beating American Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-4 3-6 6-4.  Both players had beaten Italians in the previous round, with Mattek-Sands upsetting third seed and French Open champion Francesca Schiavone.  Australian Open finalist Li will take on Czech 16th seed Petra Kvitova for a place in Sunday's title match.  Kvitova, 21, came from behind to beat Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova 3-6 6-3 7-5 to follow up her earlier win over Russian second seed Vera Zvonareva.  Cibulkova eliminated former No. 1 Maria Sharapova in the previous round.

Hong Kong The woes of Boeing's new 787 mount as U.S. regulators ordered airlines to stop flying their Boeing 787s.  The U.S. move comes after two fleets of Boeing 787s have been grounded in Japan after alarms and a burning smell in the cabin forced a Dreamliner to make an emergency landing Wednesday.  The incident is the most serious in a spate of problems that have bedeviled the new aircraft, and comes after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for air safety, launched a comprehensive examination on Friday of the Dreamliner's design as well as its manufacture and assembly.  "The Boeing 787 incidents have taken on a new seriousness with the grounding" by All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Airlines (JAL), said Richard Quest, CNN's aviation correspondent.  "The potential of fire on board an aircraft is among the most serious issues in aviation," he said. "The plane is still safe to fly. However, Boeing must ensure the reliability of the aircraft for the airlines and the confidence of the traveling public to fly on the planes.  "That is the fundamental problem that Boeing is now facing," Quest said.  U.S. grounds Dreamliners over fire risk  What happened?  As CNNMoney reports, a Boeing 787 operated by All Nippon Airways was forced to make an emergency landing Wednesday in Japan. The domestic aircraft was traveling to Tokyo when irregular battery activity and smoke in the forward electrical compartment were detected. The aircraft then made an emergency landing at Takamatsu airport after a burning smell was detected in the plane's cabin.  Following the incident, both All Nippon and Japan Airlines said they were immediately grounding their Dreamliner fleetswhich effectively grounds about half of the Dreamliners now in operation worldwide. The Japanese airlines were among the first to take delivery of the Boeing 787. ANA has 17 aircraft, while JAL has seven Dreamliners.  Worldwide, Boeing has delivered 50 Dreamlinersbut hundreds more are on order. More than 150 Dreamliner flights occur daily, according to Boeing.  Japanese airlines suspend Dreamliner flights after emergency landing  What problems has the Dreamliner had?  In recent weeks, many. The most recent Dreamliner setbacks occurred Friday. Oil was discovered leaking from a generator on an engine at a Japanese airport, and a crack appeared in a cockpit window of a plane en route from Tokyo to western Japan, a spokeswoman for All Nippon Airways said.  On January 8, a Japan Airlines flight bound for Tokyo aborted takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport after a pilot on another airplane spotted the 787 leaking fuel. On January 7, a maintenance worker discovered the electrical fire aboard an empty plane being prepared at a gate at Logan for a return trip to Japan. Another Japanese flight was cancelled last week after sensors detected problems with the plane's braking system.  In December, a United Airlines 787 traveling from Houston to Newark, New Jersey, was diverted to New Orleans because of mechanical problems. A general inspection of all 787s in September turned up cracked engines on two planes.  The woes come after the debut of the plane in 2011nearly three years behind its production schedule.  Related: More trouble for Boeing as Dreamliner forced to make emergency landing  Do Dreamliners fly in the U.S.?  United Airlineswhich has six 787sdebuted the nation's first domestic Dreamliner routes last November. "We continue to have complete confidence in the 787 and the ability of Boeing," United said Friday in a statement. The airline described the problems as "early operational issues."  United's Dreamliner fleet travels primarily on routes connecting Houston and Chicago and between Newark and Los Angeles. Last week, the airline kicked off its first international 787 service between Los Angeles and Tokyo. Other U.S. carriers are in line to buy Dreamliners, including Delta. American Airlines has announced an order, but it's not yet "firm."  What does the troubles mean for Boeing?  The company's stock has taken a hit as the troubles mount. Several hundred are under order, making its success crucial for Boeing, which had not designed a new commercial jetliner in years before unveiling the Dreamliner.  "The 787, being a new airplane, does have teething problems," John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN last week. It's common for new planes to have "these kinds of problems," he added.  Airlines have been excited by the Boeing 787 as the first mid-size, long-range airplane, which would allow airlines to open up routes where they don't have enough demand from passengers to justify a larger plane like a Boeing 747 or an Airbus A380.  Related: How the 787 will change the way we fly  Boeing has more than 800 unfilled orders from airlines around the globe that will take years to fill. In addition to the Dreamliner assembly line at its Seattle-area factory, it built a new 1,000-worker factory in South Carolina to handle the demand. It hopes to double production of the plane this year to about 10 a month.  CNNMoney's Charles Riley and CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and CNN Wires staff contributed to this report  
 LONDON, England The father of Princess Diana's boyfriend attacked the British Royal family Monday with a series of insults and accusations at the inquest looking into how the couple died.  Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi, repeated his allegations of a massive cover-up involving the Royal family, paparazzi and for the first time Diana's sister. He has previously included British intelligence services in the alleged plot.  Al Fayed, who spent most of the day in the witness box, let out a torrent of allegations that members of the royal family were racist.  He has previously blamed Prince Philip for the deaths, insisting that the royal family couldn't bear the prospect of a Muslim marrying the princess.  "Diana suffered for 20 years from this Dracula family," Al Fayed said Monday.  "I will not rest until I die. If I lose everything to find the truth," Al Fayed, told the court.  Al Fayed, owner of London's famed Harrods department store, began his testimony by reading a statement saying Diana told him in July 1997, the month before the crash, that she feared for her life.  Watch Al-Fayed have his day in court.   He said Diana told him her ex-husband Prince Charles, and the queen's husband Prince Philip, wanted to "get rid" of her.  Diana said she had a wooden box with her initials on it containing all the details about why she feared for her life, Al Fayed said. He added she told him that if anything ever happened to her, he needed to know about the box.  After the crash, however, the contents of the box were stolen before he could get to them, he said.  For the first time Al Fayed implicated Diana's sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, in the alleged cover-up. He said he spoke to her about the wooden box after the crash, but the fact that the contents were later stolen is evidence that she tried to conceal them, he said.  Al Fayed has previously said that Diana was pregnant with Dodi's child at the time of the crash, although British and French police investigations into the crash have discounted this.  At the inquest, Al Fayed testified that Diana and Dodi were engaged and planned an announcement the Monday after the crash.  When an inquest lawyer challenged Al Fayed as to why he didn't tell everybody once he knew about the alleged engagement, Al Fayed claimed he had only just found out himself.  "It was one hour before they were murdered. Am I going to announce it after they were dead?"  John Macnamara, the former head of security for Al Fayed, last week said at at the inquest that he did not he believe Prince Philip was involved in a conspiracy to kill the couple.  During the five-month inquest, witnesses have been questioned about a mysterious white Fiat Uno which some witnesses reported seeing shortly before the crash but which was never traced.  Al Fayed said the car belonged to paparazzo James Andanson, who did own a white Fiat Uno. Al Fayed said Andanson, who was found dead two years later in a burned-out car, was part of the murder plot and "assassinated" to cover up his role.  The inquest has also heard testimony about whether the chauffeur, Henri Paul, was drunk on the night of the crash.  Al Fayed claimed Paul was sober and that French investigators botched the tests, though he did not give evidence to support the claim. Instead he alleged a coverup by two French investigators: Dominique Lecomte, who conducted the post-mortem on Paul, and Gilbert Pepin, who tested Paul's blood.  Al Fayed also questioned the delay in transporting Diana to a hospital after the crash, adding she might have survived had she gotten treatment sooner.  He also alleged that MI6, Britain's foreign Intelligence Service, infiltrated the British tax service, as well as the Home Officethe UK's interior ministryand continued to conspire against him. Al Fayed said the Home Office denied him a passport as part of the plot.  The inquest is required under British law whenever someone dies in suspicious, sudden, or unexplained circumstances but it will only decide how they died and not lay blame.  It began in October 2007after the French and British investigations into the crash concludedand is expected to last six months. E-mail to a friend  CNN's Teresa Martini contributed to this report.

Boulder, Colorado The media have begun to make comparisons between Hurricane Katrina and the earthquake in Haiti. And in some ways, the two events are comparable.  Like Katrina, the earthquake has produced effects of catastrophic proportions. Both events rank among the largest catastrophes ever experienced in the Western Hemisphere.  They both have resulted in large loss of life and immense human suffering and make the coordination of emergency resources extremely difficult. Ordinary citizens are left to fend for themselves in the wreckage. And as we saw in Katrina and see now in Haiti, residents of disaster-stricken areas are the true first responders.  The aftermath of such catastrophes brings more prolonged suffering and massive recovery challenges. People pay attention as the media cover them, but they turn their attention elsewhere when the cameras leave, even though many of the real challenges that victims and affected regions face emerge later. Like the Gulf region, Haiti will struggle for years and perhaps decades to rebuild and recover.  But there, the comparisons end.  To get an idea of the distinction between the two events, imagine that all of the U.S. west of the Mississippi were to be destroyed or extensively damaged by some immense catastrophe in one minute, with absolutely no warning. That is the situation Haiti faces.  As horrific as it was, Katrina was a region-wide catastrophe, not a national one. Damage was enormous in the Gulf region, but the resources of the larger nation remained intact and available for mobilization, even though aid was slow in coming.  Katrina did not flatten our nation's capital or prevent national leaders from communicating with one another. Impacts were catastrophic in areas where Katrina struck, creating significant logistics problems, but the infrastructure of the rest of the nation was untouched. Also important, it was possible to issue warnings for Katrina, which enabled the vast majority of those who were at risk to evacuate to safety. The victims of the earthquake had no such warning.  In contrast, the earthquake in Haiti destroyed much of its capital, Port-au-Prince, and affected approximately one-third of the population of the entire country. The proportion of the nation's population that has been killed, injured or left homeless is enormous. The facilities that could have assisted victims, such as hospitals, clinics and the UN headquarters for the nation, were destroyed or are not operational. Aftershocks, which will continue for weeks, months and perhaps even years, will do additional damage and further compound both rescue and relief efforts.  There is another distinction that makes these events non-comparable.  Katrina affected the most vulnerable in the impact region: the poor, the elderly, the disabled, nursing home and hospital patients, and other at-risk groups. But the concept of vulnerability takes on a new meaning in the Haiti earthquake. The entire nation is desperately poor; 80 percent of the population lives in poverty and more than half that number in abject poverty.  On almost all indicators of well-beinghealth, education, literacy, incomeHaiti ranks very low. The nation has a long history of rule by dictators, political coups and savage violence. The capacity of Haiti's series of governments to provide services to its people has been abysmal for most of its history.  In many ways, residents of Haiti faced a daily disaster even before the earthquake. These differences matter, and they should be kept in mind by those seeking to see parallels between the two catastrophes.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Tierney.  
 LOS ANGELES, California  A crowd of about 10,000 came to Dodger Stadium on Saturday, but they weren't there for a baseball game.  Job seeker Eric Clardy, right, shakes hands with recruiter Raul Mendez from L.A. County Probation Department.  While the Dodgers were in Arizona for spring training, more than 80 employers set up employment booths in the parking lot just beyond the center field fence. To those who turned out, finding a job would be a home run.  Participating companies included Coca-Cola, Lowe's and Union Bank. And government agencies including the FBI, the Social Security Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers  were there, too.  All had one thing in common: They were hiring. And that was music to the ears of 30-year-old Eric Clardy.  It has been a rough couple of years for Clardy. He was laid off from his job as a loan processor when the real estate market started to tank. Then, after finding work as a project manager for a plumbing company, layoffs struck again.  "It's kind of like, get the job now so you can pay your bills, then start towards the career that you really want," he said.  Clardy said his goal is to make contact with at least 10 potential employers a day via phone, letters and the Internet. Being unemployed is hard work, too.  Watch how Clardy goes about trying to find a job   "It was a scramble," Clardy said. "I was selling insurance, doing temp jobs, going to job fairs."  The city of Los Angeles and the California Employment Development Department organized Saturday's event, which they said drew about 10,000 people.  Earlier this month, a two-day job fair to fill some 500 part-time jobs at the stadium during baseball season drew about 7,000 applicants.  California's unemployment rate is 10.1 percent, a full 2 percentage points higher than the national rate. The state's Employment Development office estimates that nearly a half-million state residents have lost their jobs in the past year.  "We are not seeing as many job opportunities as we saw a year ago," said Gloria Bratton Moore, who runs the state-funded Work Source job center in Los Angeles. Nonetheless, she said, "There are jobs available."  But at Dodger Stadium, it was clear that competition for those available jobs is stiff. Applicants were often stacked four and five people deep in front of employer tables, and there was little chance for most of the 10,000 job seekers to make much of an impression. But organizers worked hard to pump up any flagging spirits.  "Yes we can. Yes we can," Los Angeles School Board member Monica Garcia chanted over a loudspeaker.  State lawmaker Kevin deLeon told the crowd that they are among the nation's hardest-hit in this economic downturn, but he exhorted them to not give up.  "We will get out of this economic funk," he said. "We will recover soon. We've got to have hope."  Garcia and deLeon's comments echoed the campaign slogans of President Obama, who recently won approval of a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus package. Recruiters from the government agencies present at the job fair said that money will start creating jobs within the next few months.  The Army Corps of Engineers told applicants that it is hiring for a wide variety of positions, including those for engineers, heavy-equipment operators and environmental field workers. The Commerce Department is adding more than 1 million jobs in preparation of the 2010 census, and other federal agencies are hiring as well.  All of that was good news to Clardy, who left resumes and filled out applications at a number of the 80 booths cluttering the stadium's parking lot. But he remained realistic about this day's activities leading directly to a job.  "It seemed like a couple of years ago, the job fair was really your first interview," he said. "Now it doesn't seem like that. Some companies are not even taking resumes at the job fairs anymore."

One doctor says the study "very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine."  A new study published in the January 2008 issue of Archives of General Psychiatry found the prevalence of autism cases in California children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in 1999, suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder. Researchers from the State Public Health Department found that the autism rates in children rose continuously during the study period from 1995 to 2007. The preservative, thimerosal, has not been used in childhood vaccines since 2001, except for some flu shots. The latest findings failed to convince some parents and advocacy groups, who have long blamed mercury, a neurotoxin, for the disorder.  For years, parents have been concerned that a mercury-containing vaccine preservative may play a role in autism. But a study conducted in California found that autism rates increased even after thimerosal was removed from most vaccines. The study authors say this is evidence that thimerosal does not cause autism, although advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates have been affected. Do these findings suggest that autism isn't linked to mercury in vaccines?  Dr. Sanjay Gupta, chief medical correspondent: Let me explain. In 1999, manufacturers began removing thimerosal - which is a mercury-based preservative - from vaccines. Some people believed autism would decrease as a result, because they thought the two were connected. A new study in the Archives of General Psychiatry says this just didn't happen. Researchers looked at cases of autism in California after 1999. They reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism, the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed.  Just the opposite happened. From 2004 to 2007, when exposure to thimerosal dropped significantly for 3- to 5-year-olds, the autism rate continued to go up, from 3 per 1,000 children to 4 per 1,000 children in California.  A child psychiatrist who supported the study said it "very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine." But advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates were affected by removing thimerosal from vaccines. The National Vaccine Information Center says the study doesn't include children under the age of 3, which they say is the only group that was never exposed to mercury in vaccines. It says thimerosal wasn't completely off the shelves until 2002 or 2003. Their main point is that mercury is a neurotoxin, so why take a chance by putting it in vaccines?  What do scientists think causes autism?  As many as one in every 166 children in this country is found to have autism, and doctors still don't know why. Doctors point to genetics and environment as culprits, but it could be more complicated than that. The latest research shows these children are not necessarily born with autism but with the potential to develop it. What exactly are these outside factors? It's hard to pinpoint. What we eat, what we breathe, what we drinkall these things could play a role. Some doctors say the increase is due to a change in the way the condition is diagnosed  kids who were once labeled mentally retarded are now being labeled as autistic.  What are possible signs of autism in your child?  Doctors are now looking for signs of autism in children as young as 18 to 24 months.  Some red flags that indicate your child may have autism: no babbling or pointing by 12 months, no single words by 16 months, no brief phrases by 24 months, loss of language or social skills. If you see any of these signs, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends seeing a pediatric neurologist, developmental pediatrician or child psychologist.  What led companies to remove thimerosal from vaccines to begin with?  Several things pushed companies in this direction. Over the past decade, more and more attention was given to the health effects of mercury on humans. And then in the '90s, the CDC added new vaccines to the list of routine shots that children should get. Some of them used thimerosal as a preservative. This was happening while the government was trying to decrease our exposure to mercury. So the FDA began looking into the issue. In 1997, Congress passed a bill that mandated review of products containing mercury, which led manufacturers to begin removing thimerosal from vaccines two years later.  
 Beijing Beijing and the Vatican are again shadow boxing over the ordination of a new Chinese bishop without the Pope's blessing.  After years of quiet diplomacy and a tacit agreement to jointly appoint Chinese bishops, the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Associationwhich oversees the country's state-sanctioned churchin recent days ordained one bishop over the Vatican's objections, while another was reportedly detained after resigning from the CPA.  "It's worrisome," said a Catholic priest in Beijing, who asked not to be identified. "Are we going towards confrontation again?"  Bishop detained after shunning Party control  The two sides have been estranged since 1957, when China broke off relations with the Vatican. Beijing then accused Rome of engaging in anti-socialist activities.  In recent years, they have been talking quietly about restoring official relations.  One big stumbling bloc remains the Vatican's official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province.  Analysts say the two sides are close to reaching a modus vivendi on the diplomatic issue, but remain far apart on the ordination of bishops.  The CPA said last year that it would press ahead with plans to appoint 40 new bishops, a challenge to the Holy See's authority.  "It's a question of religious freedom and leadership of the Chinese church," explained the Catholic priest.  China's 10 million or so Catholics remain divided between those who worship in illegal "underground' churches"-- loyal to the Vatican, defiant of Communist Party controland those in a state-approved churches.  Despite the division, and the festering spat between China and Rome, Chinese Catholics remain devoted to their faith.  In recent years, Catholicism as other religions, are seeing a revival as more and more Chinese turn to faith.  Congregations seem to be thriving, as I observed on a recent visit to the Yongning parish, about two hours drive north of Beijing.  A choir sung the Chinese version of "Morning Has Broken," as 200 churchgoers heard Father Francis Zhang Tianlu deliver a Sunday mass.  Since he moved to Yongning last year, Zhang, 45, has turned a lethargic church into a vibrant congregation, as I discovered.  "When I moved here, this church building was so old, its roof was collapsing," Zhang told me during a tour of the area.  The Yongning church was originally built in 1873 by the French religious order of Vincent Depaul, before it was destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 when members of an anti-foreign Yihetuan attacked foreign missionaries, diplomats and traders, as well as Chinese Christian converts.  More than 600 Catholics were killed in Yongning and buried in the ground where the church now stands, Zhang said.  Rebuilt in 1902, the church had been in disrepair until last year. "We repaired it without government help," Zhang said proudly. "Individuals and groups contributed, in cash and in kind and with volunteer work."  More are joining the church. "When I just got here, there was only one 85-year old lady who attended the daily mass," he recalled.  Last year, 268 older residents were baptized, and this year over 50 young city-dwellers converted, too. "Finally I can see some faces of young people," he gushed.  A Western Catholic priest, who asked to remain anonymous, credits the 45-year priest for adapting well to China's rapidly changing society.  "Father Francis is creating new urban congregations and that is exactly what the church in China should be doingcontinuing to minister in the old existing churches, or building new churches in old villages."  Zhang noted that his diocese used to be home to at least 2,000 Catholics.  "Many of them are still going to the underground churches," he said. "Sometimes they invite me to their homes for a meal. They tell me they are eager to turn theirs into an open church, to worship God openly and devoutly."  His mission now, he said, is to encourage them to join the open churches.  Zhang used to worship underground.  "For ten years, my family provided four houses for underground assembly," he recalled. "In 1988, we decided to worship openly."  That means joining the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.  A fourth-generation Catholic, Zhang attended a Beijing seminary for five and a half years. He later enrolled in British and Belgian universities, where he studied philosophy, psychology and church management.  He also attended the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing to learn about diplomacy.  "Merely preaching is not enough," Zhang said. "You have to learn some knowledge of international relations."  Zhang has also learned how to balance his faith with the authority of the state.  Zhang disagrees, diplomatically, with Beijing's defiance of the Vatican in the ordination of bishops.  "I think it's not a good idea," he said. "I do hope Chinese government will pay attention to the universal idea, the universal church law of the Holy See.  "At the same time I hope Holy See can really understand the church in China and find out what it really looks like.  "Of course we follow China and we also follow the Roman Catholic way," he added.  "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. What belongs to God, return it to God. The state and church interaction is very dialectical."  For the foreseeable future, it seems, Chinese Catholics will just have to continue the balancing act between church and state.  Will Evans contributed to this report.  
	 'A new study published in the January 2008 issue of Archives of General Psychiatry found'
Sen. Robert Menendez slammed accusations that he had paid a Dominican woman for sex and expressed hope Tuesday that those behind the claims would be exposed in the wake of the woman's notarized confession that she'd never even met the New Jersey Democrat.  "I hope that you will all vigorously go after who was the source and purpose as you did go after the story at the time," he told reporters.  In a notarized statement filed in court, Nexis de los Santos Santana said she was filmed without her knowledge when she claimed that Menendez had paid her to have sex.  "I am the person in the video, that is me, and those are my words, but this statement is not true," Santana said in the statement. "I never agreed to be recorded."  In addition to criticism over accepting unreported plane flights and allegedly advocating on behalf of a business, Menendez was accused of partying with prostitutes in the Dominican Republicaccusations he said were "unsubstantiated."  As he did when the claims first emerged, Menendez said Tuesday the claims are "false smears" lifted from right-wing blogs ahead of the election.  Menendez faces scrutiny over ties to Florida doctor  "Look, I don't know more than what I have read. But I do know from the very beginning I have said that nameless, faceless, anonymous sources ... from the right wing blogs took this story which was just false smears right before an election cycle, attempted to do it then, and ultimately drove it into the mainstream press," he said. "But they were never anything other than false smears."  The confession document was presented at a press conference Monday by lawyer Vinicio Castillo, who said Santana was recruited to make the claims against Menendez by another lawyer, Dr. Miguel Galvan.  Galvan, in a notarized confession, pins the blame on a third lawyer, who Galvan said asked him to assist in a divorce case by finding "witnesses" to claim they had sex for money with Menendez.  CNN has attempted to reach both the lawyers who allegedly recorded the escort making the claims against Menendez, but has not yet received a response.  Questions revolve around his relationship with Salomon Melgen, the Florida man who owned a plane Menendez admits having flown three timesonce on official Senate business, and twice for personal reasonsto the Dominican Republic in 2010.  Melgen, his wife, Flor, and his daughter, Melissa, have been generous donors to Menendez, his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years. Castillo is Melgen's cousin and spokesman.  In January, Menendez paid approximately $58,500 to Melgen for the flights he took in 2010, chalking up the lapse in payment to his busy schedule.  On Tuesday, Menendez answered questions about intervening on issues on Melgen's behalf by saying, "we raise questions all the time for a wide range of universe on public policy issues and we think that those are all legitimate."  A law enforcement official said last week the FBI was continuing to "pursue all leads" surrounding the Menendez allegations, including the prostitution charges.  The same law enforcement source said federal agents had gone to the Dominican Republic in hopes of finding the women who claimed to have had sex with Menendez, but that the women had not yet been located.  The Daily Caller, a conservative website, originally published the video with two women claiming they had sex with Menendez for money. In an article published Tuesday, the Daily Caller said Santana was not one of the two women who were featured in the video, though Santana asserted in the notarized court document she was one of the women.  In her statement Monday, Santana said she was told she would be paid well for reading the script. Both she and Galvan requested legal protection in making their confessions.

 WICHITA, Kansas An anti-abortion activist suspected in the death of Kansas doctor George Tiller told CNN on Tuesday the closing of Tiller's women's clinic is "a victory for all the unborn children."  Scott Roeder, charged in the death of Dr. George Tiller, spoke to CNN on Tuesday.  Scott Roeder, 51, would not admit to CNN's Ted Rowlands that he killed Tiller, who was gunned down at his church May 31. But he said if he is convicted in Tiller's slaying, "the entire motive was the defense of the unborn."  Tiller's family said Tuesday the clinic he headed will permanently close, effective immediately, and they would issue no more statements. At the time Roeder was interviewed Tuesday, word of the permanent closure had not come outbut when told the clinic had been shuttered since Tiller's death, he said, "Good."  Roeder said the closure would mean "no more slicing and dicing of the unborn child in the mother's womb and no more needles of poison into the baby's heart to stop the heart from beating, and no more partial-birth abortions."  Watch Rowlands describe Roeder's mood during interview   Dan Monnat, Tiller's attorney, declined to respond to Roeder's comments on the family's behalf. But in an e-mail, he added, "Speaking for myself ... I am reluctant to in any way legitimize Mr. Roeder, or anything he stands for, by directly responding to his statements.  "I am content to let law enforcement determine whether anything he says merits attention. I do not encourage anyone else to give Mr. Roeder or his extremist views any additional attention as he awaits trial," Monnat wrote.  Tiller, 67, was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortions. He had already survived one attempt on his life before he was slain, and the announcement by Tiller's family dismayed supporters of abortion rights.  Nancy Keenan, the president of Washington-based NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Tiller's killing "part of an ongoing pattern of extreme anti-choice violence and intimidation" aimed at depriving women of a legal medical option.  "It is a sad day for our country when family members who stood by their husband and father as he endured countless anti-choice attacks are forced as a result of his murder to make a decision like this one," Keenan said in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon.  Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, expressed hope that other doctors "will be brave enough to come forward and continue Dr. Tiller's critical work of providing services to women."  "It is unacceptable that anti-abortion intimidation and violence has led to the closing of Dr. Tiller's clinic. It illustrates the ongoing harassment endured by abortion providers and the resulting disservice to women across this country," Northup said.  Roeder is jailed on first-degree murder and aggravated assault charges in Tiller's death. A Kansas judge earlier this month set his bail at $5 million.  Tiller's family said Tuesday it is "proud of the service and courage shown by our husband and father," and that it would honor his memory "through private charitable activities." The statement promised his patients "that the privacy of their medical histories and patient records will remain as fiercely protected now and in the future as they were during Dr. Tiller's lifetime."  Peter Brownlie, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, said he and his staff "fully respect and understand" the family's decision.  "Their loss is immensethey have lost a husband, father, grandfather and hero," Brownlie said in a statement. But the closure of Tiller's clinic "creates a significant gap in access for women and families in Kansas," he continued. "No one is providing that service between Kansas City and Denver."  Most of the leading U.S. anti-abortion groups have condemned Tiller's killing and disavowed Roeder, saying they wanted Tiller's clinic shut down, but through peaceful means.  Troy Newman, the president of one of those organizations, Operation Rescue, said in a statement on the group's Web site Tuesday that his group is "thankful that Tiller's clinic will not reopen and thankful that Wichita is now abortion-free." But he added, "This is a bittersweet moment for us at Operation Rescue. We have worked very hard for this day, but we wish it would have come through the peaceful, legal channels we were pursuing."  Operation Rescue and other Kansas anti-abortion activists had supported a criminal investigation by former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline, a petition drive to empanel a special grand jury to investigate the practice and efforts to get his medical license revoked. On its Web site, the group referred to Tiller as a "monster" who had "been able to get away with murder."  But in a New York Times interview last week, Newman said closing the clinic because of the shooting would be cause for concern.  "Good God, do not close this abortion clinic for this reason," he said. "Every kook in the world will get some notion."  Roeder met with Rowlands for a half-hour Tuesday, talking on a phone through security glass at the Sedgwick County jail where he is being held. He initially was reluctant to talk, as he said he had been misquoted in another interview. But he gradually opened up, noting that he was giving the interview against the advice of his defense attorney.  Roeder told CNN he is "feeling good," and getting encouraging letters from people around the country, many of whom he does not know. But he complained about conditions in the jail, saying he doesn't like being in solitary confinement and that the jail is "freezing."  Associates have told CNN that Roeder was a regular among the protesters who routinely gathered at Tiller's clinic. Roeder's former roommate, Eddie Ebecher, has told CNN Roeder was "obsessed" with Tiller and in the past had debated whether to kill him.  Relatives said Roeder had suffered from mental illness over the years and had refused treatment at times. He served prison time in Kansas in the late 1990s after being arrested with explosives in his car, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.  But Roeder said Tuesday that reports he has mental illness or schizophrenia are "totally wrong." He acknowledged having a drug problem at one point, but said he has been off drugs since he was 28 years old and has no mental illness.  Rowlands said he attempted to discuss Tiller's death with Roeder, pointing out that there were witnesses to the shooting and its aftermath who claim they saw Roeder leaving the scene and got a license plate from the car. Roeder nodded, Rowlands said, but still would not admit any culpability.  But "He didn't say, 'I didn't do it,' " Rowlands said. "He didn't say, 'Get me out of here, I'm the wrong guy.' "  Federal civil rights prosecutors have launched an investigation into Tiller's slaying, the Justice Department has said. The inquiry will focus on violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and other applicable federal laws.  Roeder was concerned about the possibility of federal charges, saying his lawyer has warned him that he will be facing them if he doesn't stop talking.  CNN's Michael Cary contributed to this report.  
	 'NEW: Scott Roeder says he is "feeling good" and getting encouraging letters'
Washington President Barack Obama announced Monday that the United States will resume using military commissions to prosecute alleged terrorists held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility.  In the announcement, the president said his administration remains committed to closing the controversial detention facility but will rescind its previous suspension on bringing new charges before military commissions. The commissions are military proceedings rather than trials in civilian courts.  Obama also called for prosecuting Guantanamo detainees in U.S. criminal courts when appropriate, and issued an executive order calling for periodic reviews of suspects held under indefinite detention.  The steps followed through on Obama's previous call to reform the process of prosecuting or holding Guantanamo detainees to make it more in line with international laws and standards, according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified by name.  However, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights both criticized the administration for what they called institutionalizing indefinite detention of terrorism suspects who have yet to be formally charged or designated for transfer to another country, but are considered too dangerous to set free.  "The creation of a review process that will take up to a yeardesigned to be repeated every four yearsis a tacit acknowledgment that the Obama administration intends to leave Guantanamo as a scheme for unlawful detention without charge and trial for future presidents to clean up, despite the fact that senior officials acknowledged today that keeping the prison open continues to hinder our national security in the long run," the constitutional rights center said in a statement.  Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York also called the administration's announcement disappointing, saying the Guantanamo facility is a "blot" on U.S. national honor.  Noting that Congress passed a law prohibiting the transfer of Guantanamo detainees for trial in the United States, Nadler said that "as a result, the administration has turned to the legally dubious military commissions to try these suspects."  Established in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorism attacks on the United States, the Guantanamo Bay facility has been a lightning rod for criticism of the U.S. handling of terrorism suspects.  Under the Bush administration, allegations of mistreatment of detainees, including harsh living conditions and denying them full U.S. legal rights, led to the facility becoming a recruiting tool for terrorist groups such as al Qaeda, U.S. officials say.  Obama previously pledged to close the Guantanamo Bay facility within a year of taking office in January 2009, prompting criticism from conservatives. In addition, his administration has sought to prosecute some high-profile detaineessuch as alleged September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammedin civilian courts on the U.S. mainland, which drew widespread opposition that crossed traditional party lines.  The Guantanamo facility remains open today due to legal complexities involving the status of some detainees and congressional opposition to holding trials for high-profile suspects in U.S. criminal courts.  Shortly after Obama's announcement Monday, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced the withdrawal of his prior suspension of new charges before military commissions.  Gates cited reforms of the military commissions under a 2009 law, and he and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen both expressed support for also using civilian courts to prosecute terrorism suspects.  "For reasons of national security, we must have available to us all the tools that exist for preventing and combating international terrorist activity, and protecting our nation," Gates' statement said. "For years, our federal courts have proven to be a secure and effective means for bringing terrorists to justice. To completely foreclose this option is unwise and unnecessary."  Congressional Republicansincluding Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith of Texas, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard "Buck" McKeon of California and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King of New Yorkwelcomed the renewal of military commissions.  However, McKeon and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan criticized Obama for acting on his own instead of working out a policy with Congress.  Rogers said he was "disappointed the White House chose to put another Band-Aid on this problem, rather than working with Congress to develop the comprehensive and long-term legislative framework we need."  McKeon also questioned what the steps announced Monday mean for high-profile detainees such as Mohammed and other September 11 conspirators.  The senior administration officials refused to comment on any individual cases. They said they expected new charges against Guantanamo detainees to be filed with military commissions soon, perhaps within days or weeks, and noted that the Obama administration had transferred 67 detainees to third countries so far, leaving a total of 172 in the facility.  In addition, the senior administration officials said they would try to repeal the law that prevents the transfer of Guantanamo detainees for trial in the United States.  "Military commissions should proceed in cases where it has been determined appropriate to do so," the administration said in an information sheet issued Monday. "Because there are situations, however, in which our federal courts are a more appropriate forum for trying particular individuals, we will seek repeal of the restrictions imposed by Congress, so that we can move forward in the forum that is, in our judgment, most in line with our national security interests and the interests of justice."

 (CNET)Craigslist's managers have complied with the wishes of most of the state attorneys general who demanded they rid the site of prostitution ads.  Craigslist says it has removed prostitution ads, but some issues remain.  The Web's dominate classifieds publication replaced its controversial "erotic" section with a new "adult" category. And where Craigslist once relied on readers to flag dodgy advertisements, the company's employees now review every ad submitted to the adult area before they appear online.  Yet, the site has been unable to block every solicitation for sex. Catherine, a self-described sex worker from San Francisco, confirmed for CNET that she successfully posted an ad for her services to the adult section late last week. She wished to remain anonymous, so neither the ad's photo nor text can be included in this story. Regardless, it isn't hard to find questionable ads in Craigslist's new adult section.  The most noticeable difference between Craigslist's erotic and adult categories is the photos. In the adult section, the photos are less provocative. Less skin is showing. When it comes to the text, however, the two sections are very similar.  Both are packed with ads for massage services. Ads in both areas include descriptions of the masseuse's breast size ("I'm a natural C cup") and they are often photographed dressed in their underwear. Even if most of these services are legitimate, and only a few are veiled offers of sex in the new adult area, plenty of others make little if any pretense about what they offer.  These ads typically include words such as "busty," or "fantasy girl" in their descriptions. Often, they feature photos of a woman or man dressed provocatively in their underwear or bathing suit. Some include hourly rates.  Clearly, Craigslist faces a significant challenge as it tries to purge prostitution from its Web pages. While it can ban nude photos and overt offers of sex, how can anyone expect the site to outlaw ads featuring photos of bikini-clad women offering phone numbers? One can find racier images in department store ads.  The Internet has made it easier for merchants of all kinds to conduct commerce and reach wider audiences. Should anyone be surprised that the sex trade has benefited from this as well. If Craigslist were to disappear tomorrow, does anyone really expect that would curb prostitution?  A review of some competing online classifieds shows that while Craigslist has been a popular destination for sex workers, it is by no means the only one.  For example, Backpages.com is an online classified publication and Craigslist competitor. The content it produces can also be found on the Web sites of some entertainment and alternative publications in major metropolitan areas, such as New York's Village Voice or San Francisco's SFWeekly.  Craigslist is G-rated compared with the photos found in Backpages' adult section. Ads included nude photos while others showed people engaged in sexual intercourse. A common ad would show a bare chested woman asking men to call her at a phone number.  In the area of Backpages that services Charleston, S.C., one ad found on Tuesday by CNET featured a photo of a bare-chested woman apparently engaged in masturbation. It must be noted that there was nothing as graphic on Craigslist. This is relevant because Henry McMaster, South Carolina's attorney general, last week threatened Craigslist with a criminal investigation.  McMaster hasn't made any similar threats--at least none that has been publicized--against Backpages. Managers at Backpages did not respond to an interview request.  In November, Craigslist and 40 state attorneys general, including McMaster, signed an agreement that called for the site to add more safeguards. The classifieds publication followed through and one of the new changes was a new requirement that anyone posting to the erotic section must provide a credit card. All the parties hoped that criminals would be unwilling to provide identification and this would be deterrent.  "Many of the classified and communication services on the Craigslist site provide the public with a valuable service," McMaster wrote to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster on May 5. "However, it appears that the management...has knowingly allowed the site to be used for illegal and unlawful activity after warnings from law enforcement officials and after an agreement with forty state attorneys general."  Since then, Craigslist did away with the erotic section and agreed to review every ad before it appeared, but McMaster was dissatisfied. He posted a note on his site that said the "Craigslist South Carolina site continues to display advertisements for prostitution and graphic pornographic material. This content was not removed as we requested. We have no alternative but to move forward with criminal investigation and potential prosecution."  This is at best an empty threat, says Matt Zimmerman, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  The Communication Decency Act protects Web sites like Craigslist from being held criminally liable for the actions of its users, Zimmerman said, who added that Craigslist has no legal obligation to even review ads before they go online.  Had Zimmerman had his way, Craigslist would have never agreed to do the monitoring. Craig Newmark, Craigslist's founder, had earlier gone on national TV and said that Craigslist would not do away with the erotic section. The company's reversal may have led McMaster to believe he could shame Craigslist managers into doing more than what the law required. "It made life more difficult for Craigslist I think," Zimmerman said.  "But I was much more disappointed with (McMaster) than Craigslist," Zimmerman said. "His threats were bogus to begin with and he was wrong to threaten (Craigslist's managers) with jail when the law is very clearly on their side."   2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

	 'The U.S. will resume using military commissions to prosecute alleged terrorists held'
Israeli President Shimon Peres said he had an amicable phone conversation with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a day after Erdogan stormed offstage during an angry exchange with Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan leaves the stage Thursday, as Israeli President Shimon Peres sits, left.  Peres said he and Erdogan did not take the spat personally.  "I called him up and said, yes, it's nothing against you, nothing against Turkey. We consider you as a friend," Peres said. He said Erdogan reciprocated.  Although there was no mention of an apology, Peres said there was a polite exchange between the two leaders.  "I didn't take it personally. I didn't go for a personal fight. I answered unfounded accusations. It was my duty. And they didn't change my mind," he said.  Watch Shimon Peres on the Gaza conflict   Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation, has long been the Jewish state's closest military and economic partner in the region, and Turkey recently mediated indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria.  But many Turks have been incensed with Israel over its three-week military operation that ended there earlier this month.  And in Davos, Erdogan was angered after Peres said that Israel is committed to peace and blamed Hamas for the fighting in Gaza, where Israel staged a three-week military operation that ended earlier this month.  When Erdogan began responding, a moderator cut him off, saying the debate had run over its allotted time. Erdogan patted the moderator on the arm until he was granted one more minute to respond.  Watch commentary on Erdogan's angry exchange   "I know the reason behind raising your voice is because of the guilty psychology," he said to Peres. "My voice will not be that loud. You must know that. When it comes to killingyou know killing very well. I know how you hit, kill children on the beaches."  He then left the stage, complaining that Peres was receiving preferential treatment.  "From now on, Davos is finished for me," Erdogan said. "I will not come back. You won't let people talk. You gave him 25 minutes, but you gave me 12 minutes. This is not right."  Erdogan had described the military campaign against Hamas fighters in Gaza as "barbaric" and accused Israel of using excessive force.  He said: "The Palestinian Territories are like an open-air prison, isolated from the world. I have always been a leader who said anti-Semitism is a crime against humanity. But so is anti-Islamism."  Peres had said Hamas was responsible for the "tragedy," accusing the Islamist militants of creating a "dangerous dictatorship."  "Israel left Gaza completelyno occupation," Peres said. "I want to understand why they throw rockets at us."  On Friday, after his outburst, Erdogan returned home to a hero's welcome. Thousands of people lined up at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, cheering and waving signs. A large banner read, "You Will Never Walk Alone," and smaller signs bore phrases including "Davos Conqueror." People also were seen waving Turkish and Palestinian flags and throwing flowers on the road leading to Erdogan's home.  Despite the glowing response at the airport, there has been some criticism in the Turkish media of Erdogan's exchange with the Israeli president.  CNN Turk's Deniz Bayramoglu said the issue was still "hot" with Erdogan's secularist political opponents speaking out against the prime minister.  "They also say that Israel's behavior in Gaza is unacceptable but they are very critical of Prime Minister Erdogan's behavior," Bayramoglu said.  "Some are saying they are really proud of Prime Minister Erdogan and some are saying it is a diplomatic scandal."  Erdogan explained whom he was directing his anger at during a news conference at the airport. "My words were only to the Israeli government, not the Israeli people," he said.  CNN's Simon Hooper and Talia Kayali contributed to this report.  
  In-form superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi go head-to-head in Monday night's El Clasico between Real Madrid and Barcelona in the Camp Nou, which is set to have a significant bearing on the Spanish title race.  The world's most expensive player Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in Real's 5-1 thrashing of Athletic Bilbao in their last league outing, which kept them one point ahead of Barca, who crushed Almeria 8-0.  Messi, the reigning FIFA world player of the year, also netted a hat-trick for the defending champions, who have beaten Real in their last four league meetings.  Ronaldo, who was on the receiving end last season as his team were pipped by the Catalan giants for the title, does not expect history to be repeated with his compatriot Jose Mourinho now in charge at the Bernabeu.  Capturing sport's biggest characters  "It could be a decisive match as the two sides are so even and these games could decide the championship," the Portuguese told AFP.  "It would be difficult for the losing team to take.  "We are stronger than last season and we go into the match without losing a match and have a lot more confidence and solidity.  "The team looks really good and the coach has given us a lot of confidence."  Mourinho, like his Barcelona counterpart Pep Guardiola, has spent the pre-match build-up trying to downplay the significance of a victory for either side.  "The Clasico is obviously an important match because we will play against a direct opponent," he told the official Real Madrid website.  Blog: Are we in for the greatest El Clasico in history ?  "Nevertheless, whatever happens, 25 league games will still remain. I expect a beautiful game in which players help the referee and true football takes center  stage," he added.  And this from Guardiola, who will be hoping his team can capitalize on home advantage to make it five wins in a row in the biggest derby match of all.  "This will not be decisive though, but whoever does win will surely be considered to be the champions for the next week at least," he told his club's official website.  Mourinho is guaranteed a hot reception in the Camp Nou, having been a former assistant coach there under Bobby Robson before embarking on his incredible managerial career.  "I don't see any coaches worrying about how they may be received. My concentration won't falter if the stands are against me. I don't care. I just want to play football and enjoy it. That's all," claimed Mourinho, who masterminded a Champions League semifinal victory over Barcelona as Inter Milan coach last season.  Both teams are expected to be a virtual full strength, with the home side having a doubt over Gaby Milito, who missed training Sunday, while Kaka remains sidelined for Real Madrid.  Ronaldo, who tops the La Liga scoring charts with 15, just ahead of Messi, claims the match is so much more than an individual battle between the pair.  "Talking about a duel between myself and Messi is nonsense," Ronaldo.  "I am just one player and I don't think I have more pressure than my teammates. We all have the responsibility to perform well.  "I am not obsessed by scoring goals and I am not obsessed by scoring against Barcelona."  Argentina ace Messi has scored in three out of their last four victories over Real, including a double in their 6-2 rout in the Bernabeu two seasons ago.  "Real will come to Camp Nou with revenge in mind," Messi told AFP.  "Since the 6-2 at the Bernabeu I guess they have a real desire to beat us and this season they have strengthened with the new signings and (Jose) Mourinho."  The return El Clasico will see Real entertain Barca on the weekend of April 16/17 in the title run-in.

Fabio Cannavaro is to join the Italian national squad on Sunday for their World Cup qualifier against Cyprus next week, despite being under the cloud of a drug test controversy.  Fabioo Cannavaro's proudest moment came in 2006 when he led Italy to World Cup glory.  It was revealed on Thursday that the 36-year-old Juventus defender recently failed a drug test after taking a medicine that contained the banned substance cortisone.  Cannavaro was interviewed by the Italian Olympic Committee's (CONI) anti-doping prosecutor Ettore Torri on Thursday night in Turin but national coach Marcello Lippi does not expect his star to be absent from the squad.  "I have not spoken to Cannavaro," Lippi told reporters. "Will he be here with us on Sunday? Of course he will.  "I have not spoken to Cannavaro," added national team doctor Enrico Castellacci. "But he is calm and serene. This is just a bureaucratic case."  Juventus claimed the defender needed cortisone treatment for an insect sting in August. The player requested an exemption from taking drugs tests on the grounds of having taken a medication in an emergency situation but his request did not include a document necessary to complete the application.  While awaiting a decision, Cannavaro took an anti-doping test after a Serie A game at Roma which returned a positive result.  "When he came to the national team, after the Roma game, he told us what had happened and he told us that without the medicine that contained cortisone he would have had a reaction, an anaphylactic shock," Castellacci said.  "We asked Juventus for all the necessary documents regarding the medicine taken by Cannavaro and all the communication is in our possession."  Cannavaro will not travel to Dublin for Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Ireland as he serves a one-match ban, but is expected to lead the Azzurri in Wednesday's qualifier against Cyprus in Parma.  
 Megumi Yokota was only 13 when she was abducted by a North Korean agent in the 1970s. Now, almost 40 years after her disappearance, her aging parents, Shigeru and Sakie Yokota, have traveled to Mongolia to meet her daughtertheir granddaughter.  In a series of meetings in Ulan Bator arranged by Japanese and North Korean foreign ministry officials, the Japanese couple met 26-year-old Kim Eun-gyong,  her husband and 10-month-old daughter.  "Our long-cherished dream had come true," Shigeru Yokota said at a press conference. "It was actually first time to meet her although I've been seeing her on TV (since she was) 14 or 15."  Yokota, who was kidnapped from the port city of Niigata in 1977, was not present at the meeting. North Korean authorities insist that she committed suicide, although this is disputed in Japan and repatriated ashes proved not to be a DNA match.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters Monday morning that he was "glad" to hear that the meeting was conducted safely.  "We are determined to resolve the abduction issue at any cost," he said.  The abductee issue is a considerable sticking point in Japan-North Korea relations. The reclusive state has admitted to kidnapping a number of Japanese nationals, mostly to help train spies in Japanese language and culture.  The Yokotas said that they were unable to confirm their daughter's safety with Kim, as political matters were off the table. However, her mother said, "I spent time with them believing Megumi is still safe somewhere."  The meeting took place as North Korea's bellicosity is once again on the rise, with reports that the Stalinist state has fired a number of short-range missiles into the sea off its east coast.

Washington The United States expressed concern Thursday about recent arrests in Zimbabwe of political and civil society activists and allegations by their lawyer that some of them were tortured.  On February 19, former Movement for Democratic Change Member of Parliament Munyaradzi Gwisai and 45 other labor union and student activists "who had gathered peacefully to discuss recent events in Egypt" were arrested and charged with treason, State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said in a statement.  Other political and civil society activists have also been arrested, he said.  "Gwisai's defense attorney has reported that several of the 46 people were tortured while in custody, and we understand that the magistrate has ordered physical examinations to substantiate those claims," he said. "We call on the government to provide medical attention for those who need it and, if torture occurred, to take immediate action to hold the perpetrators accountable."  A ruling on the charges' merits is to be delivered March 7.  Crowley called on the government of Zimbabwe to uphold rights spelled out under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to ensure that those arrested are guaranteed due process.  Zimbabwean authorities said the 46 people were arrested and charged with treason after they were caught watching footage of the protests that led to the ouster of Tunisian leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.  "On 16 February they held a meeting and the purpose of the meeting was to organize, strategize and implement the removal of a constitutional government of Zimbabwe by unconstitutional means, the Tunisian-Egyptian way," prosecutor Edmore Nyazamba said last week in court.  At least 12 of the activists were beaten with broomsticks on their buttocks and the soles of their feet, defense attorney Alec Muchadehama told a packed courtroom on Thursday. All 46 defendants were charged with treason, a charge that carries a death sentence in Zimbabwe.  "If watching television footage of the uprisings was treason, most Zimbabweans would be guilty of it because we watch news daily," Muchadehama said.  Robert Mugabe, 87, has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. Like Mubarak and Ben Ali, he has been accused of rigging elections and instituting repressive laws to tighten his grip on power.  The arrests may be an indication that authorities are worried that the changes sweeping across north Africa may inspire Zimbabweans to rise up. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, which is in a troubled unity government with Mugabe's ZANU-PF, has called the arrests "an abuse of state machinery by ZANU-PF to suppress the people's views."  Mugabe's policies over the past decade have been blamed for plunging the once-prosperous country into economic crisis. Mugabe has called for an election this year, but his political rival and leader of the MDC, Morgan Tsvangirai, has threatened to boycott the poll if a referendum on a new constitution is not held.  
 Anyone who has struggled to be healthy is intimately familiar with the counting game. They've counted calories, carbs, Weight Watchers points, their heart rate, steps and miles.  Now a new smart eating utensil called the HapiFork will help them count bites during meals, and maybe shame them into eating slower and potentially losing weight.  Technology has made it easier to track the minutiae of everyday life, with smartphones, pedometers and small sensors that can fit in wearable devices such as wrist bands. The self-tracking hobby has blossomed into the quantified-self movement, which reaches far beyond the health conscious.  People are tracking their sleep patterns, heart rate, mood, air quality and work habits, often in a bid to analyze enough data to correct problems with their health or lifestyle.  "Whatever we can measure, we can improve," said Fabrice Boutain, CEO and founder of HapiLabs.  In the case of the HapiFork, what can be improved is how fast people eat. It takes 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it is full and that it's time to stop eating, putting speedy eaters at risk for being overeaters. The HapiFork team says there are many potential health benefits to eating slower, including decreasing acid reflux, obesity and diabetes.  The $99 fork first gained attention during the Consumer Electronics Show in January and will be on the market by the end of the year.  How it works  The fork can be used to passively track eating habits and automatically sync that information, including duration of meals and frequency of forkfuls, with a smartphone. The HapiFork mobile app will also include a coaching program and tools to connect with friends and family.  The device can also be set up for behavior modification, vibrating any time the diner is eating too quickly as a gentle reminder to slow down. By default it is set to allow a bite every 10 seconds, though the exact time is customizable.  When the metal tines of the HapiFork touch the mouth, a circuit is closed and a bite is tallied. The data is automatically transmitted to a smartphone over Bluetooth or can be uploaded using a micro USB port in the base. The fork, which can stay charged for 15 days, has a thick plastic handle that houses the electronics. The core pops out so the fork can be washed by hand or run through a dishwasher. You must hold down a button to turn it on before each meal, but it powers down automatically after you stop using it.  A hands-on (and mouth-on) test  I tested the fork out this week on a lunch of seared-tuna salad. There are only 10 prototypes of the HapiFork, each thoroughly sanitized between the many test eaters (I hope). It was a pretty tasty salad, and soon slow, responsible bites turned into shoveling. When two bites happened in the same 10 second window, the fork vibrateda somewhat unsettling feeling especially if it's near your teeth.  I'd slow down for a while, mostly out of embarrassment, but eventually I'd forget and the fork would buzz me again. It happened about five times during the length of the meala fairly typical count for newbies, according to Boutain.  HapiLabs subscribes to the theory that it takes 21 days to create a habit. If you use the fork consistently for 21 days, it should retrain you to automatically eat slower at all times. One meal wasn't enough time to cure me of my snarfing ways, but I was more aware of how fast I ate for the rest of the day.  Origin of the smart fork  The fork was invented seven years ago by Jacques Lepine, who compares the retraining to techniques used by habitual nail biters to cut down on their nibbling. Such as coating nails with bitter-tasting polish, for example.  Last year Lepine connected with 5-year-old health and fitness content company HapiLabs, which is based in Paris and Hong Kong. The two joined forces just in time to take the first prototypes to CES in Las Vegas, where it was an instant hit.  HapiLabs has 120 employees, only 10 to 15 of whom are currently working on the HapiFork project. But that ratio could change soon if the fork takes off.  When can you get one?  On Wednesday, the HapiFork team launched a 45-day Kickstarter campaign to raise $100,000 and sign up the first 1,000 users. Those early adopters will be the company's first chance to collect a large amount of data and test how effective the fork's vibration is at changing eaters' behavior. HapiLabs plans to start shipping the first forks to early Kickstarter donors at the end of the summer, and roll the devices out to everyone by the end of the year.  "We want to cater to a community of people who like to eat mindfully," said Boutain.  Data, data everywhere  Since it has started collecting data from test users, HapiLabs has found that people take about 70 fork bites per meal. They start eating fast but slow down after six minutes, and in an interesting bit of carb trivia, they tend to eat rice much faster than pasta (possibly due to the labor-intensive twirling process).  This is just a sliver of the kind of insight the fork could give the company and medical researchers into how people eat. That potential is what makes the fork more than just a silly and fun novelty gadget. It represents an evolution in tracking technology.  In the coming years sensors will pop up in more and more household objects tracking things like air quality, movement, vital signs and other stats. This potential flood of sensors could lead to a mess of data, with each piece of information tracked in its own app. Fitness trackers like the Nike Fuel Band and the Fitbit are already hugely popular. A new company, Estonian startup Jomi Interactive, recently announced it is working on tracking devices that fit onto water bottles and monitor how much water you drink.  Ideally all the sensor companies will work together so that different data can be shared across apps and devices, allowing it to be analyzed for even more insightful conclusions. (Do you eat less on days you get more than 8 hours sleep? Does the air quality in your home effect your mood?)

Kampala, Uganda Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni says sectarian and chauvinistic cultural leaders are behind weekend attacks by people, armed mainly with machetes and spears, who killed security personnel and civilians in the western part of the country.  Police raised the death toll to 90 on Tuesday afternoon. Hundreds have been arrested, police said, including cultural leaders of rival ethnic groups in the Rwenzori Mountains region and in the oil-rich Lake Albert region bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Most of the dead "are attackers killed in a counterattack at a military camp in Bundibugyo district and civilians," police spokesman Fred Enanga said. "We have so far found 86 key suspects out of hundreds, and we continue with a cordon and search in the communities looking for 22 guns we lost.  "Most of guns were stolen at a police station and at a bank" where there are police guards and private guards, he added.  In a statement Tuesday, Museveni said the killings were the result of "schemes of some confused or a selfish bunch of people," adding that 51 attackers and eight security force members are among the dead.  "On account of chauvinistic ideas being bandied around for so long, it seems some groups hatched this criminal scheme that has caused the deaths of so many people," he wrote.  While the attacks were dealt with by the police and army, Museveni said, "of course, there was a failure of intelligence." He asks: "How did these people weave such a scheme without being preempted?"  Museveni says altogether, there were 13 daylight attacks across three districts in the Rwenzori Mountains and Lake Albert regions.  
 The United States issued a general travel alert for Americans in Europe on Sunday amid concerns that al Qaeda or related groups plan attacks similar to the 2008 massacre in the Indian city of Mumbai.  "U.S. citizens should take every precaution to be aware of their surroundings and to adopt appropriate safety measures to protect themselves when traveling," the notice from the U.S. State Department said. "We continue to work closely with our European allies on the threat from international terrorism, including al Qaeda."  The advisory is not meant to tell Americans to avoid travel, but to take "common-sense precautions" in case of trouble, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy told reporters Sunday.  "If they see unattended packages or hear loud noises or see something beginning to happen that they should quickly move away from them," he said. The warning urges them to be cautious in public places like tourist sites and airports or while riding public transportation, and Americans should know how to contact the U.S. Embassy and consider registering their travel plans there, he said.  In addition, thousands of U.S. troops based in Germany were placed under a curfew Friday night and were ordered not to wear their uniforms off base, according to an order obtained by CNN.  Kennedy said the State Department has issued travel alerts for Europe for "a variety of reasons" in the past, including the recent eruption of a volcano in Iceland that snarled air travel across the continent.  The State Department said worldwide travel alerts have been issued for U.S. citizens in the past, most recently in early September after the pastor of a small Florida church threatened to burn copies of the Quran, the Islamic holy book.  Previous alerts were issued after the 2004 al Qaeda bombings of commuter trains in Spain's capital Madrid and after the 2005 bombings of subway trains and buses in London, England.  News emerged last week that Western intelligence officials were looking at information about a possible "Mumbai-style" attack in cities across Europe, and a British security source said Saturday that intelligence related to such a plot was being looked at very seriously on both sides of the Atlantic.  Mumbai, India's financial hub, was the site of a three-day terror attack in November 2008 that left more than 160 people dead. Ten men launched the carefully planned assault, targeting two major hotels, the historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center.  Kennedy would not comment on specific intelligence sparking the report, but said it followed a "cumulative" process.  "We have been monitoring this carefully for at least several weeks," he said.  Don Hamilton, a former State Department counterterrorism expert told CNN Sunday that the alert is "about the mildest thing they can say."  "The State Department is historically extremely cautious about these things," he said. It doesn't want to be accused of failing to warn Americans if they have some information about a possible attack beforehand, but Hamilton said the alert is less severe than a more formal travel warning involving concrete threats.  A U.S. official said Saturday that the alert was prompted by the volume of intelligence on possible terror threats, rather than any new intelligence.  At the White House, spokesman Nicholas Shapiro said President Barack Obama "has been following the threat information on a daily basis."  "From the day we became aware of this latest plot, the president made clear we need to do everything possible to disrupt this plot and protect the American people," Shapiro said. Sunday's alert "is responsive to the president's direction that we spare no effort," he said.  A senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Obama met with members of his national security team Friday night and Saturday morning and received another briefing Sunday morning. The official said European allies are "all in sync" with the United States, "both in terms of our assessment of the threat as well as our shared conviction that governments have an obligation to keep their citizens informed of terrorist threats."  Several European governments said Sunday that they are not raising their already-high alert levels as a result of the latest reports. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Sunday that the U.S. advisory was "in line with the general recommendations that we have addressed to the French population."  "The indications provided by the U.S. authorities, in particular regarding terrorist threat in Europe are, of course analyzed, cross-referenced and where appropriate included in our national assessment of the threat, which still relies on a series of elements," the ministry said. "The terrorist threat remains high in France, the alert level remains unchanged at level red."  Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office changed its travel advisory for British citizens in France and Germany from a "substantial" threat of terrorism to a "high" threat, but the FCO said it does not comment on intelligence matters and thus can't specify whether the change is related to the U.S. travel alert.  Germany's interior ministry said in a statement that the warning for Americans comes in light of recent threats and that Berlin was informed by the U.S. of the decision to issue the alert. Germany will analyze and evaluate the intelligence data coming in but will not be changing its current threat level at this time, according to the statement.  Also, a spokeswoman for Spain's Interior Ministry told CNN that the country will remain at Level 2 alert, which indicates a "high, probable risk" of a terror attack. Spain has remained at this stage since January of this year.  CNN's Ed Henry, Elise Labott, Bharati Naik and Al Goodman contributed to this report.  
	 'NEW: The U.S. State Department says it has issued a travel alert for Americans'
Beijing I was at the last public speech by the former U.S. ambassador to China Gary Locke. During the Q & A session, a Chinese student asked the outgoing ambassador to compare the Chinese dream and the American dream. The ambassador said he didn't know much about the Chinese dream, so he talked instead about the American dream.  Like Americans, the Chinese people also have their dreamsa powerful country, a good education, a happy family, or a bountiful harvest. Yet the dreams of the ordinary Chinese have never been articulated as powerfully and eloquently as the American dream, until Xi Jinping came into power.  OPINION: China's awkward 'banana' slip  Xi first mentioned the term "the Chinese dream" during his tour of an exhibit at the National Museum of China in November 2012, shortly after he became leader of the Chinese Communist Party. That exhibit is called the Road to National Rejuvenation, and Xi said the Chinese dream is the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  Then on March 17, 2013, Xi fully spelled out his thoughts about the Chinese dream in his first public speech as the newly elected president of China. "The Chinese dream is the dream of the whole nation, as well as of every individual," he said. "The Chinese dream, after all, is the dream of the people. We must realize it by closely depending on the people, and we must incessantly bring benefits to the people."  Publicity campaign  After his speech, the Chinese dream has entered the daily discourse of both the Chinese government and the ordinary Chinese, thanks in no small part to the government's massive publicity campaign. There were countless speeches, contests, essay competitions, scholarly conferences, and TV shows that had the Chinese dream as the central theme. If there had been a contest for the most popular Chinese phrase in 2013, the Chinese dreams would probably have won the title.  Apart from nationwide publicity, there are other reasons why the Chinese dream has become a household phrase. It is much less elusive than Mao Zedong's Thoughts, Deng Xiaoping's Theories, Jiang Zemin's Three Represents, or Hu Jintao's Harmonious Society; it is a term that can be understood by any Chinese. Besides, who doesn't have dreams? Thus it easily resonates with the Chinese people. Finally, Xi promised to realize the dream by depending more on the people and bringing more benefits to them. Thus Xi's dream, at least in its rhetorical form, is a dream for the people, by the people, and of the people. Who doesn't like such a dream?  Reforms  And Xi meant what he said, at least in one area and that is corruption, the most urgent issue facing the Chinese community party. He has launched an unprecedented crackdown on corruption, and 20 high-ranking officialsvice-minister level and abovehave been investigated or punished within a little more than year.  He also signed two documentsEight Regulations and Six Bansthat have significantly improved bureaucratic efficiency and sharply reduced public expenses on receptions, overseas travel, and vehicle purchases. Because of Xi's tough campaign, China's entertainment businesses, particularly top-end restaurants, clubs, and hotels, have suffered enormous losses, over which the ordinary Chinese are rightfully gloating.  Rampant corruption, be it bribery, buying and selling offices, illegal land grabs, or abuse of power, is certainly the biggest scourge of China today, leading to rising discontent and unrest as well as declining public trust in government. Most importantly, corruption seems to have made it increasingly difficult for the ordinary Chinese to have their dreams come true.  Restoring confidence  China is becoming economically and militarily much more powerful, and the average Chinese is living a much better life. Yet at the same time more and more Chinese seem to have lost faith in the government and the future of China. A prosperous and powerful China should be a land of opportunities for its people, but actually it appears to have become a land of anger and despair for an increasing number of Chinese.  Thus Xi's articulation of the Chinese dream and his campaign against corruption can be viewed as the first steps by the new Chinese leadership to restore public confidence in the party and the government. Thus far, his policies have won enthusiastic support among most Chinese, and Xi has become arguably the most popular leader since Deng Xiaoping.  If the dreams of the ordinary Chinese todaylike those of their ancestors in ancient Chinadepend on the good luck of having a sage leader, however, that means China is still under the rule of man, not rule of law. When that leader steps down, or if that leader makes disastrous decisions, the dreams of the Chinese people will be in jeopardy.  With immense popular support at the moment, President Xi should initiate institutional reforms that empower every Chinese to have dreams and to have those dreams come true. These reforms will not only set China on a path of sustainable political and economic development, but also enable the Chinese people to be truly proud of the Chinese dream, just as Americans are proud of the American dream.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tao Xie.  
 Southwest Airlines passenger Matthew Harper says he was singled out because of his weight before a recent Chicago to Denver flight, told by a flight attendant that he could be removed from the aircraft, according to CNN affiliate KDVR.  "We're people too. I get out and I work every day. You know, it's discrimination," said Harper, who weighs 340 pounds.  "We sincerely regret Mr. Harper's unhappiness over his experience," said Southwest in an e-mailed statement. "We have personally called Mr. Harper to offer him our apologies and better understand his concerns. It's important to clarify that he did travel as scheduledwe did not deny him boarding. Our employee informed him of our policy, and he proceeded to travel as scheduled."  Airline squeeze: It's not you, it's the seat!  Southwest's "customer of size" policy suggests that customers purchase a second seat in advance if they know they'll need it on the flight. The rule of thumb: not encroaching on "any part" of the neighboring seats.  "The armrest is considered to be the definitive boundary between seats; width between the armrests measures 17 inches. The purchase of additional seats serves as a notification to Southwest of a special seating need, and allows us to adequately plan for the number of seats that will be occupied on the aircraft."  The airline will refund the cost of the second seat after the flight.  As airlines pack more passengers into their aircraft and charge for amenities like legroom and first-on-board boarding rights, how do you think people who don't fit into those seats should be treated by the airlines?

Apple is known for building excitement over its latest gadgets, but the company's next closely watched event has nothing to do with a product. Instead, anticipation is growing over the scheduled return of Apple's charismatic CEO.  Steve Jobs looks gaunt at an event in October. He began a leave of absence three months later.  It's been almost six months since Steve Jobswho co-founded Apple and has thrilled the public by launching consumer tech favorites such as the iPhone and the iPodannounced that he was taking a medical leave of absence until the end of June.  As that time quickly approaches, Apple fans, investors and observers have been gripped by questions.  Will he come back as promised? If so, in what capacity? And how crucial is he still to the company's success?  Jobs, who is a pancreatic cancer survivor, revealed at the beginning of this year that a hormone imbalance caused the considerable weight loss that had some speculating whether his cancer had returned.  See a timeline of Jobs' life and career   "The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward, and I've already begun treatment," Jobs wrote in a letter addressed to the "Apple community" on January 5.  "But, just like I didn't lose this much weight and body mass in a week or a month, my doctors expect it will take me until late this spring to regain it."  There had been little news since. But that all changed Saturday when The Wall Street Journal reported Jobs, 54, had a liver transplant about two months ago in Tennessee. He has been recovering well, but may work part time for several weeks when he returns to work, the newspaper reported. Fortune: Inside Steve Jobs' liver transplant  The fact that the article appeared just hours after Apple began selling its new iPhone 3GS had some bloggers questioning the timing of the report, with some suggesting that the excitement over the rollout helped draw attention away from the revelations about Jobs' health.  Apple didn't comment on The Wall Street Journal report directly, answering media questions with the same statement.  "Steve continues to look forward to returning to Apple at the end of June, and there is nothing further to say," said Apple spokesman Steve Dowling.  Dowling declined to provide a specific date for Jobs' return or say whether Jobs would be making any public appearances or statements.  'Iconic figure'  "This feels like they're clearing the way for his return. But it wouldn't be out of character for Apple to let the deadline slip a bit," said Philip Elmer-DeWitt, who writes the Apple 2.0 blog for Fortune magazine and has been covering the company since 1982.  "The real issue of Steve coming back is: How much does the company need him?"  How much, indeed?  Investors have been painfully aware of how any development regarding Jobs' healthreal or rumorcan affect Apple's stock price. But experts say Apple has been taking steps to ensure that its fortunes are not linked with Jobs taking an active role in the company. Watch how Jobs' health has affected Apple  "He's an iconic figure that everybody wants around, he's the world's greatest salesman and that's irreplaceable," said Gene Munster, a senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray who has been covering Apple since 2003.  "But as far as the product direction and the product quality, the road map for the next five years is already in place [at Apple]."  Munster described Jobs as a visionary and someone with the ability to figure out what the next big thing is. But he said Piper Jaffray's "Buy" recommendation on the company's stock wouldn't change even if Jobs doesn't come back, based on the strength of products such as the iPhone.  Still, few companies have been so closely associated with their CEOs. Munster likened the situation to Henry Ford and the car company he founded at the beginning of the 20th century. Elmer-DeWitt said it could be compared to Walt Disney and the entertainment giant he created.  Jobs is also much more than just a CEO. His knack for developing must-have gadgets, his signature black turtlenecks and dramatic delivery during product launches have made him a cultural icon beyond Silicon Valley. He was even hilariously impersonated on "Saturday Night Live."  Smaller role  Observers say Apple and Jobs himself have made efforts in recent years to "wean" the public off his presence, such as including other people onstage with him during events and de-emphasizing his role.  "Last year a lot of pundits were [saying that] if Steve Jobs left the company, the company would just immediately fall into ruin," said Daniel Eran Dilger, a contributing editor for AppleInsider.com.  "And what's interesting is after he went on leave, and he's been gone for six months now, the company has had a couple of major announcements and events and has gone on fine."  When he began his leave of absence, Jobs put Apple Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook in charge of the company's day-to-day operations. If Jobs decides to step down, Cook can take over and probably will, Elmer-DeWitt said.  "There are lots of smart people at Apple and most people have sort of accepted the idea that ... Jobs trained an executive team to operate the company without him," he added.  "And that his DNA, the thing that makes Apple different from all the other companies, has been baked into the leadership team and that the company will do fine."  What may be lacking years down the road if Jobs retires or leaves is his "X-factor" and his unique stamp on every little piece of design.  "Once you get a bunch of people in a room, none of whom is more powerful than the other, you start to get products that are literally designed by committee and that's what Apple products never were," Elmer-DeWitt said.  "They were always designed by very smart people that Steve chose. But ultimately there was one guy who had final say on them. It remains to be seen whether there's someone at Apple who can step up and take over that role."  
 Sen. Charles Schumer, saying he sees few tangible benefits for passengers, called Sunday on the Transportation Security Administration to reverse its decision to allow small pocketknives on airplanes.  At an afternoon news conference in New York, Schumer said TSA agents would be distracted by having to measure knives and other items like baseball bats.  "These items are dangerous, and have not become less so in the years since they were banned from planes," the New York Democrat said. "Now is not the time for reduced vigilance, or to place additional burdens on TSA agents who should be looking for dangerous items."  During the news conference, Schumer held up a slender bladed object that he said would be allowed under the new rules. "It looks dangerous and it is dangerous. This can kill someone," he said.  A representative from Schumer's office later identified the object as a knife similar to ones made by office supply companies.  The TSA subsequently responded by saying that knife would not be allowed on flights under new regulations because the blade can be locked in place and because the blade appeared to be a razor blade, which remain banned from passenger airplanes.  Schumer's request on the TSA rule change came a day after U.S. Rep. Ed Markey also came out against the TSA's move.  In a letter to TSA Administrator John Pistole, the Massachusetts Democrat expressed concern about the new policy and asked it be reversed.  "The attacks on September 11, 2001, demonstrated that in the confined environment of an airplane, even a small blade in the hands of a terrorist can lead to disaster," wrote Markey, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat recently vacated by John Kerry.  "In addition, the additional responsibility of assessing which knives meet the new requirements could be a distraction for already overburdened screeners at TSA checkpoints, potentially leading to increased wait times and decreased security."  Knives on a plane? Really?  Under the rules outlined this week, knives with blades no longer than 2.36 inches (6 centimeters) and less than a half-inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is retractable and does not lock into place. Razorblades and box cutters are still prohibited.  The rules also allow a passenger to carry two golf clubs, toy bats or other sports stickssuch as ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and pool cuesaboard in carry-on luggage.  Pistole said the move brings the United States into alignment with international rules and is in keeping with his "risk-based security" approach.  Kip Hawley, who oversaw the TSA from 2005 to 2009, said the search for knives interferes with the search for objects such as bombs and toxins that can threaten aircraft.  Ex-TSA chief backs decision  But others have sharply criticized the change, which takes effect April 25.  They include the Flight Attendants Union Coalition, a nearly 90,000-member group that has launched a campaign to reverse the TSA's decision. The policy is also opposed by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a union representing more than 26,000 officers from 65 agencies.  Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson said Friday he shares the same "legitimate concerns" as his flight attendants.  Delta CEO opposed to allowing small knives on aircraft  "If the purpose is to increase security checkpoint flow, there are much more effective steps we can take together to streamline the security checkpoints with risk-based screening mechanisms," he wrote in a letter to Pistole.

Activision is reloading the golden gun to take another shot at reviving a James Bond video game relic.  The game publisher plans to unveil a new 007 shooter based on the 16-year-old Pierce Brosnan flick, "GoldenEye," at a news conference later this month, said a spokeswoman helping organize the Activision event.  The formal announcement is to take place on July 20 in San Diego at the annual Comic-Con expo. There, Activision will also show upcoming games in the "Spider-Man" and "X-Men" series.  Activision Publishing registered Web domains last month suggesting the title of the new Bond game may be "GoldenEye 007: Reloaded."  The next Bond film, which is codenamed Bond 23, is scheduled to open in theaters on November 9, 2012.  "GoldenEye" was neither the highest grossing nor the most memorable Bond movie. But the "GoldenEye 007" game resonates with many people, even today.  In the late '90s, the four-player shooting game was part of a nightly ritual at many college dormitories and after-school meet-ups.  Rare, which created "Donkey Kong Country" and was later acquired by Microsoft, developed the cult classic, and Nintendo published it exclusively for the Nintendo 64 console.  Rare's and Nintendo's divorce, along with Activision becoming the exclusive rights holder to develop Bond games, has spun an elaborate web that has left the original "GoldenEye 007" landlocked. Nintendo and Microsoft have been unable to come to terms on how to redistribute the game.  Rare's "Perfect Dark," a futuristic spy franchise, was billed as the spiritual successor to "GoldenEye." Several "GoldenEye" designers left Rare to form a studio called Free Radical Design, which develops the "TimeSplitters" games.  But the "GoldenEye" name, story and characters hold a special place in many gamers' hearts. Seeing that opportunity, Activision remade the game and released "007: GoldenEye" for Nintendo's Wii in November. Developer Eurocom replaced Brosnan's likeness with that of Daniel Craig, the current Bond actor.  The Wii is not typically associated with first-person shooter games, and the "GoldenEye" reboot didn't necessarily break that mold. But Eurocom has said it was satisfied with the sales.  Treyarch developed a recent Bond game, based on the "Quantum of Solace" film. Most recently, it made "Call of Duty: Black Ops." Treyarch was not tapped to make the upcoming "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3," and it has not said what its next project will be.  Game industry watchers suggest the new "GoldenEye" will be released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, two systems where shooting games have thrived.  
 (The Frisky)Don't you just hate the type of person who smugly informs you, "I don't watch TV," like that's something to be proud of? They think they're so great with all their fancy book learning.  What they don't realize is that TV isn't for dummiesthere's tons of educational programming availableyou just need to know what to watch. I mean, you can learn your ABCs with "Sesame Street's" Grover, how to make gnocchi with Mario Batali, and the ins and outs of prettying up your home with any number of programs on HGTV.  Television is also a great romance resource. Think of all the great TV twosomes we've seen over the yearsLucy & Ricky Ricardo, Judy & George Jetson, Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag ... but not all TV personalities set such a sincerely loving example. It's also a good place to learn which type of guy you should avoid.  Here are a few examples:  Chuck Bass ("Gossip Girl"): Few men can pull off lavender argyle, but Chuck Bass is definitely one of them. Moody and sinister, when Chuck Bass Types (CBTs) like you, it's as though you've been inducted into a secret society of two.  It's you against the world and the CBT will bring out a dark side you might not have even realized you possessed. Whip smart with a caustic wit, he'll charm you all the while tucking away your secrets for use at a later date. And use them he will. Because when a CBT tires of you, he won't just say "see ya," he'll decimate you.  Hank Moody ("Californication"): Some boys take longer than usual to grow out of their Charles Bukowski-wannabe phase. Exhibit A is Hank Moody. Actor David Duchovny, playing what the tabloids would have you believe is an autobiographical role, has managed to hang onto his Bukowski-phase well into his forties. Drinking, partying, and resisting monogamy, Hank still manages to attract more ladies than hotter men half his age.  Of course the only women drawn to Hank are either damaged girls with daddy issues or the type of dame who doesn't feel complete unless she has some mess to clean up after. If you see yourself dating a Hank Moody type, do not walkrunto your nearest mental health professional.  Vince Chase ("Entourage"): Those big blue eyes and that floppy mop o' hair...  you can forgive him for making a stinker like "Medellin," can't you? Sure, but do you really want to deal with someone who lives in a dude cocoon? Not only does he live with his brother and two best friends, he can't make any decisions without polling the group.  On the upside, he's rich! On the downside, he's famous, which means other women are throwing themselves at him constantly. Vince might be fun for a fling, but forget about bringing him home to mama.  Don Draper ("Mad Men"): Why is it when unattractive people are quiet we just assume they're stupid and/or boring, but verbally challenged hot people get pegged as mysterious and smoldering?  Mad Men's smokin' hot Don Draper actually is mysterious (and smoldering!), so I don't know what point I was trying to make (because I'm all distracted from the photos on his IMDB page)... oh, wait! The point I'm trying to make is that while Draper is indeed mysterious, he's also a liar, a cheat and a cad. So if a DDT tries to slip you his number, just say no and send it to me. What?

Flint, Michigan A few weeks ago, Nicole Mansfield called her daughter in Flint, Michigan. She tried to calm Triana Jones down, but she had bad news.  "She said, 'I might not be home in a week, somebody stole my ID,' " Jones recalled of the conversation almost a month ago. "So she wasn't able to come home."  This wasn't a minor headache, part of the travail of international travel. Jones thought her mother could be in Syria, fighting alongside rebels in the country's bloody civil war.  Nicole Mansfield had converted to Islam several years ago, her daughter told CNN Friday.  Jones wept as she and Gregory Mansfieldher mother's fathertalked to CNN about the horror they felt seeing images on the Internet this week of a dead woman they are convinced is Nicole Mansfield.  Syrian state-run television aired a story saying that government forces had killed three Westerners. The video package shows a bullet-riddled car, weapons placed on the car hood, a computer, a hand-drawn map of a government military facility and a flag belonging to the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front.  The camera pans close to bodies arranged in a row, lying on the ground.  Mansfield's relatives told CNN they have no doubt she's one of them.  Though it's unclear how the family knew to look on the Web to see the images, they say the FBI paid the Mansfield family a visit Thursday to ask them about reports that Mansfield was killed in Syria.  "The first time I saw those pictures I had to look again because I didn't even recognize her. I didn't believe it was my mom the first time I saw them," Jones told CNN, choking back tears. "And then I had to look again and I looked at her body and her feet and her hands and her nose and her mouth. And I knew it was her."  Jones added that she's upset the pictures have gotten out, saying "I shouldn't have to see my mother's body like that all over the media and the Internet." She's also hurt by what people are saying about her motherlike that she was a terrorist or a CIA agent.  "She was just an American woman who was misguided," Jones said. "... And it really makes me sick to my stomach that people post such horrible things."  After showing the bodies, the Syrian television story shows shots of IDs; one of them appears to be Mansfield's.  Forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad killed three Westerners, an announcer says. The story also shows a picture of a British man. The UK Foreign Office confirmed Friday that a British national was killed in Syria and officials are trying to reach relatives.  The United States is aware of the claim that an American woman was killed and is working through the Czech Republic mission in Syria to obtain more information, a State Department official told CNN on condition of anonymity.  Citing concerns that the privacy of a family could be jeopardized, the official declined further comment.  CNN asked Jones why her mother might have wanted to go to Syria.  "I know that she was talking to people online and that they told her about the project in Syria," she answered. "And that she was interested in going over there to help. But she didn't think it would be fighting. She told me there wouldn't be (guns) or anything. She would never be involved in that."  "And they lied to her. They misled her and they took her and brought her over there, probably paid for her ticket and everything, and they kept her there."  CNN asked Jones if she could be more specific about what she meant by "project."  "That it was to help free the Syrians from the Syrian government and all the problems that they're having over there," she answered.  Nicole's father, Gregory Mansfield, contacted the FBI when his daughter left the United States three years ago, but he was not clear on where she went.  CNN asked Gregory Mansfield why he thought his daughter going abroad was disturbing enough to warrant notifying the FBI. He refused to explain. He said his worries concerned "Israel" and repeatedly insisted to CNN that the FBI should have revoked his daughter's passport.  Nicole's grandmother, Carole, said she last saw her granddaughter in Michigan in January. Another relative recently got a call from Nicole Mansfield in which she said she was gone, but she'd be back to the United States for a visit soon.  Carole Mansfield and Monica Steelman, Nicole's aunt, described Nicole as caring and outgoing, saying she'd sometime travel without telling her family where she was heading. She had worked as a home care worker and had been married twice, including to a man who practiced Islam.  "Nicole was the type of person if she thought that something was wrong somewhere, that she could help repair it," said her aunt.  Her niece tried to be a "problem solver," she said.  "Trouble spots," Carole Mansfield said, "... fascinated her."  Raised Christian, she converted to Islam three to five years ago and used to worship at a mosque in Flint. Carole Mansfield said she spoke to her granddaughter after her conversion.  "At that time I told her that I thought she was looking a rattlesnake in the eyes," the grandmother said. "But that's my belief. Not that I felt it made her a bad person."  
 For decades, Mike Wallace defined the image of the hard-charging investigative reporter. News of his death at 93 came Sunday and with it a multitude of remembrances and assessments of a complex man.  Wallace's longevity and his mediumthe TV networkput a face on investigative reporting for the public. His career reflected how investigative journalism evolved from the 1950s into the 21st centuryand showed why we still need it.  We watched his work on "60 Minutes" go from undercover tactics and ambush interviews in the 1970s to pieces that relied more on documents and analysisand in which targets were not entirely surprised by what was coming.  We also watched as Wallace showed how complex and confrontational investigative reporting can be. He spoke openly of subjects dodging interviews and of management and corporate interference in investigative stories. He acknowledged many of his own flaws and revealed his clinical depression resulting from the stresses of the work.  We watched too as he underwent two major controversies that would have demolished other careers. One was a $120 million libel suit by Gen. William C. Westmoreland over a story that said the military had deceived the American public about the size of opposition forces during the Vietnam War. The suit was eventually withdrawn but not before it had damaged reputations and sent Wallace into depression.  The second was over an investigation into the tobacco industry that led to a fierce internal dispute at CBS on airing the story. Eventually, all the information came out and Wallace criticized his own bosses at CBS. But the controversy still resulted in a film highly critical of the network and Wallace's handling of the story.  In addition to those controversies, his methods periodically came under attack from inside journalism, and friendships were lost and colleagues estranged or disillusioned.  However, the public stuck with himperhaps because he continued to give hope that liars could be exposed, that dangerous practices could be stopped and wrongheaded policies overturned.  Backed by a series of talented reporters and producers over the years, he was the front manthe "closer" so to speakfor teams of investigative journalists and for the public. In the theater of the interview, he conveyed the outrage and skepticism of journalists who spent months digging for the truth.  One of his former producers, Charles Lewis, wrote Sunday, "Mike Wallace will go down in history as the finest investigative interviewer on the most popular and most honored network television news program in U.S. history."  Lewis, a founder of two nonprofit investigative journalism centers, added, "At 60 Minutes, he literally set the gold standard for fearless, 'tough but fair,' go-for-the-jugular questioning and showed the world and the profession how investigative television news could look, should look."  Wallace also exemplified a very American attitude that no matter how powerful someone is, he or she is expected to answer to the public for actions taken and mistakes made.  When he confronted someone, many viewers felt Wallace represented their frustrations and spoke for them. When Wallace said the subject of an interview had to be kidding, he really meant the subject had to be kidding everyone watching. Before the camera, he embodied the democratic attitude that everyone is equal and everyone is accountable.  In the end, one might wonder how he could continue to get those interviews after all those years of blistering confrontations, but I got a clue in 2000.  At the time, I was executive director of the professional organization Investigative Reporters and Editors and Wallace had been invited to be on a showcase panel at the annual conference in New York City. He came half an hour early and cheerily talked with the conference staff.  But while waiting backstage he suddenly said he needed one of his well-known catnaps. We offered to get a cot, but he said no thanks, folded his suit jacket inside out into a pillow, lay down on the floor and promptly fell asleep.  For 10 minutes the staff delicately stepped over and around him. Then he got up, completely alert, thanked everyone for inviting him, and smiling went on stage to chat with a thousand journalists.  I suspect it was that kind of regular guy attitude that got so many to talk to him, to believe in him, and even some of his targets to forgive him.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brant Houston.

The Syrian government has sent U.N. investigators the results of blood and soil testing from a mysterious attack that killed 25 people and injured more than 110 others, CNN affiliate ITN reported Sunday.  Syria has claimed that rebels used chemical weapons in an attack Tuesday in Khan al-Asal in the northern province of Aleppo, according to state-run media. Opposition officials have said rebels don't have access to chemical weapons or the missiles needed to use them in an attack.  Other rebel leaders have claimed Syrian troops fired "chemical rockets" at civilians and opposition forces.  Syrian opposition leader steps down; Israeli troops face fire from Syria  U.S. President Barack Obama and other American officials have said in recent days there was no intelligence to substantiate reports that rebels used chemical weapons against government troops.  And a U.S. military official directly familiar with preliminary intelligence analysis of the attack told CNN there were "strong indications" that no chemical weapon was used. The United States, in part, looked at video of the victims released by state-run television.  Analysts believe it's possible people in the video were deliberately exposed to a caustic agent such as chlorine, the official said. But that would not be the same as using chemical weapons such as a nerve or blister agent.  Syrian refugees flood Jordanian town  Sunday, ITN reported three unnamed Syrian medical or military officials said Damascus believes a small amount of chlorine mixed with saline and a homemade rocket were used.  "All sources we have spoken to say there is a pattern of victims suffering a variety of respiratory complaints from mild breathing difficulty, through fainting and vomiting to loss of consciousness and death," reporter Alex Thomson wrote on his blog. "In most cases there were no signs of any conventional blast injuries in terms of external lacerations, burns or fractures, they say."  Victims' blood samples, soil samples and rocket debris were sent to the United Nations, he reported.  Thomson wrote that the sources said the rocket was fired from an area that has been controlled by the radical Islamist group al-Nusra Front for "some time." The group is one of the most effective in the Syrian resistance, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere. In December, the U.S. State Department moved to blacklist the rebel group as a foreign terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq.  The Syrian government last week sent a written request to the U.N. for an investigation. The United Kingdom and France also put in requests.  Jean Pascal Zanders, a chemical weapons expert and a senior research fellow for the  European Union Institute for Security Studies, cast doubt on the use of chlorine, saying in an e-mail that one small rocket couldn't deliver the quantity needed to kill 25 people.  Chlorine isn't listed on any of the three lists of chemicals banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997.  "It is no longer considered effective as a warfare agent, " he wrote.  Official: 'Something went down' in Syria, but it was short of chemical weapons  Thomson added that in war, both sides lie, but this "is the most detailed account yet of what the Syrians believe happened."  Analysts believe the Syrian government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Specifically, the supply is believed to include sarin, mustard and VX gases, which are banned under international law. Syria has denied the allegation.  The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the production, stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons. Syria is not one of the 188 signatories to the convention.  In recent months, reports have repeatedly surfaced that Syrian forces moved some of the chemical weapons inventories, possibly because of deteriorating security in the country, raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-linked groups working with the opposition should Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government fall.  Focus on Syria: Chemical weapons frightful, relatively inexpensive  
 Imagine if it were possible to build your own home, in this day and age, for less than $35,000. Or to cut up some timber and piece your new home together like a giant jigsaw puzzle.  What if you could create, with your own hands, a home that collects its own rainwater and generates its own power, so you never have to pay a bill again?  As far-fetched as it sounds, if you can't afford to buy a house, then designing and building your own may be more viable than you assumed. Today, upcoming architects and designers are coming up with solutions to the problem of rocketing property prices, by building houses of their own and sharing their plans on the internet.  In the UK, a young architectural practice has devised the world's first 'open-source' building. Made of simple materials and freely available plans, the 'WikiHouse' was conceived by English designer Alastair Parvin as a low-cost solution to the global housing shortage.  The aim of the project is to allow anyone in the world to design, share, download, adapt and 'print' a house that is inexpensive and tailored to their own needs.  Construction of the house requires no special parts and the entire building can be made from pieces of timber that snap together. According to its inventors, the frame of the WikiHouse can be assembled in under a day, by people with absolutely no construction training.  Using a CNC machine, amateur builders can download cutting files from the company's website and then "print" the component parts of the WikiHouse from a sheet of plywood.  Parvin says that the motivation for designing cheap, easy-to-build housing was to help make architecture more accessible. "The open secret is that in reality almost everything we today call architecture is actually design for the 1%," Parvin says. "The challenge facing the next generation of architects is how, for the first time, we will make our client not the 1% but the 100%to radically democratize the production of architecture."  For Parvin, spreading affordable housing requires the empowerment of amateurs. "We are moving into a future where the factory can be everywhereand increasingly the design team can be everyone. We need to build tools and institutions for the social economythe 'long tail' of people who are making for themselves," Parvin says.  This same spirit is present in Dominic Stevens' grassroots project 'Irish Vernacular', in which he built a home for $33,200. Stevens documented his efforts to create his house online to inspire others who might wish to follow his lead. The blog features comprehensive photography and information on the building process, plus professional plans and cartoon instructions that are simple enough for almost anyone to follow.  Stevens' self-built home is a stunningly impressive three bedroom house that looks like it's been ripped from the pages of Wallpaper magazine. The building's bright living spaces and high quality finish belie its low price. According to Stevens, the house was primarily made from timber, and its roof is clad with a lightweight corrugated material called onduline. The house was largely constructed by a small group of Stevens' friends over the course of a long weekend (plus a little extra time to get the project finalized).  After sharing his plans online, Stevens says that he received significant interest from people hoping to build their own home. "By sharing my plans, I hope that it might be inspirational to people who have the skills, or will, or wish to put their own house together."  Stevens has also found that making his plans publicly available has actually stimulated his business. "I think if you open up and submit to sharing things, you get it all back," he says.  Craig Strachan, Development Director at the National Self Build Association warns that not everyone will necessarily be able to build their own home: "Dominic Stevens' project is inspiringa fantastic home created for a fraction of the usual cost, however the time and energy required to do this make it difficult for the 'average person' to undertake."  Seeking a cheaper lifestyle and a more ecological existence, Simon Dale built his own 'Hobbit House' in Wales back in 2009 for just $4,600 (3,000). Dale says the whole building was constructed with a hammer, a one-inch chisel and a chainsaw, and was made largely of scavenged materials. Dale says "Anything you could possibly want is in a rubbish pile somewherewindows, burner, plumbing, wiring."  Dale, who has no training as a builder, built his eco-home with the help of a few friends and family members. The eco-home uses water from a nearby stream, and is heated by a wood burning stove with wood gathered from the surrounding forests. The property has a compost toilet, and is powered by solar panels on the roof.  Famous architects have also been turning their minds to the global housing crisis. Renzo Piano, the designer of the ShardLondon's tallest buildingrecently unveiled a working model for the 'Diogene'the smallest scale project he has ever mounted, which attempts to create a functional micro home that is fully featured but at an economical scale.  Renzo Piano's Diogene house is designed to function self-sufficiently. Water is collected by the house, then cleaned and reused. The house also generates its own power through solar panels mounted on the roof.  Architecture critic Hubertus Adam says that Piano's design addresses many of the housing crisis's central problems: "We live in an age in which the demand for sustainability forces us to minimize our ecological footprint. This is paired with the desire to concentrate and reduce the direct living environment to the truly essential things."  Strachan says that individuals building their own houses may be critical to the future of home ownership: "self build and custom build offer people a real alternative to buying a new home, and allows them to define the environment in which they live. Most projects use local labor and materials which helps stimulate the economy around them."

With flights to Paris topping $1,000 these days, travel to France can be trs cher. But you needn't cross the pond for that Gallic je ne sais quoi.  Here are five enclaves in North America where French culture thrives:  Montreal,Quebec  Settled by French fur traders and later captured by the British, Montreal grew into a bilingual city with dual identities. And while myriad other tonguesare spoken thanks to a thriving immigrant population, it remains the second-largest Francophone city in the world after Paris. You'll hear bonjours and ca vas in every borough, but the most solidly French neighborhoods are east of Boulevard St.-Laurentthe de facto border that separates it from the largely English-speaking west side.  Linger over an espresso at one of the terrasses (patios) that line Rue St. Denis in the Latin Quarter. Then head to the vaunted L'Express, a classic Parisian bistro in Plateau Mont-Royal, where everything from the zinc bar to the tight quarters to the duck confit will spark flashbacks of Montmartre.  Go for: The FrancoFolies is a festival celebrating Francophone music with some 250 live acts. June 14-22.  Quebec City, Quebec  Founded by French explorer Samuel de Champlain more than 400 years ago, Quebec City, like Montreal, fell to the British crown a century and a half later. Its Gallic culture, however, remained firmly intact. Today, nearly 95% of the residents are native French speakers. The city's gabled roofs, winding streets and ramparts conjure an Old World feel. Vieux-Quebec (Old Town) is the only fortified city in North America north of Mexico.  Get the full scoop on Quebec's French heritage at the Muse de la Civilization, where a new exhibition tells the story of Francophones who pulled up stakes to settle in North America with interactive features such as a hallway meant to evoke a departure dock. Around the corner, the cozy Caf Le St. Malo, with its exposed brick walls and roaring hearth fire, serves up the kind of rustic fare you find in the French countryside, such as cassoulet (a one-pot dish of white beans and meat such as pork sausage and duck confit) and boudin noir (blood sausage).  Go for: Quebecois celebrate the arrival of their ancestors in Canada at the Nouvelle France festival. August 7-11.  New Orleans, Louisiana  Claimed by France as part of the Louisiana Territory in 1682, La Nouvelle-Orlans rose from a swamp on the bend of the Mississippi River to become a strategic port city.  Named for the Regent of France, Philippe, Duc d'Orleans, the original town developed around what is now known as Jackson Square. After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, a mix of nationalities flooded the city, creating the unique French/Creole-infused melting pot that is the Big Easy today.  Nonetheless, remnants of its French heritage are evident throughout. For one, snacking on beignets and caf au lait at the venerable Caf du Monde in the French Quarter is as de rigueur for tourists as taking home Mardi Gras beads.  History buffs who can't make it to the Louvre to see one of Napoleon Bonaparte's famous marble bathtubshe supposedly signed the Louisiana Purchase while in the tubcan book Suite 730 at the 100-year-old Le Pavillon Hotel, near the French Quarter, to take a plunge in one said to have been owned by Napoleon (there are three total).  A short walk away on Esplanade Avenue, the Degas House, a bed and breakfast and former home of artist Edgar Degas, hosts "Bottles and Brushes" evenings, where amateur artists can drink wine, paint and soak up the atmosphere in the studio of the French Impressionist master.  Go for: In a nod to New Orleans' Gallic roots, French statesman Charles de Gaulle gave the city a Joan of Arc statue, an exact replica of one that stands in Orleans, which today presides over the French Market and is feted annually with a parade. January 6.  Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, French territory  A remnant of France's exploits in Canada, these rocky islands some 15 miles off the coast of Newfoundland were deeded to the republic in 1816 under the second Treaty of Paris after a century-long tussle with England. Settlers eager to work in the islands' rich cod fishery came from Acadie, Brittany and Normandy in France and the Basque country, which includes parts of Spain and France. Another boom came during Prohibition, when smuggling spirits to the U.S. made some islanders rich.  Today, the archipelagoa "territorial collectivity" of Franceretains much of the character of its mother country.  Most merchants close up shop at midday to lunch with their families at home. The baguettes and croissants are the real deal. The euro is the currency of the land, though many businesses accept Canadian and U.S. dollars.  You'll find the most action on the tiniest and most populated island, Saint-Pierre. With its colorful clapboard houses, narrow streets, classic cafes and Peugeots zipping around, it's Greenland-meets-Normandy. Join the locals as they break for la collation, a light meal, in the late afternoon; duck into Dlices de Josphine on Rue General LeClerc for a spot of Mariage Frres tea and a Paris-worthy pastry.  Go for: Bastille Day, the anniversary of the storming of the infamous prison in Paris in 1789, is celebrated at Place du Gnral de Gaulle in St. Pierre. July 14.  Cajun Country, Louisiana  Expelled by the British from what are now the Canadian Maritime provinces and northern Maine during the French and Indian War (1754-1763), many Acadians settled in south Louisiana, spawning a rich culture and their own dialect, Cajun French, that is still very much alive today.  In some pockets, such as the small town of Arnaudville, French ruleson street signs, in radio broadcasts, political ads and even as the sole language of some residents.  At the Vermilionville Living History Museum and Folklife Park in Lafayette Parish, a replica of an Acadian village depicts life circa 1765-1890. For a modern taste of Cajun life, landmark Lafayette restaurants Randol's and Prejean's host live Cajun music and specialize in local favorites such as crawfish touffe.  Go for: Unlike the glittery spectacle in New Orleans, Mardi Gras in Cajun Country has changed little since its early days. Revelers on horseback dress up in costumes made from flour sacks or burlap, and ride from house to house collecting ingredientsincluding live chickensfor a communal pot of gumbo. February 12.  
 Europe remained gripped by frigid temperatures and snow Friday, with the icy weather closing much of the Danube River to shipping and disrupting travel across the region.  Central and Eastern Europe have borne the brunt of the unseasonably bitter weather, which has led to hundreds of deaths and thousands of cases of frostbite and hypothermia.  Twenty-two countries have posted warnings for extreme cold temperatures and accumulating snow, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.  The big freeze is not likely to end any time soon, Miller said, with the Arctic air forecast to continue spilling deep into Europe, keeping temperatures well below average and allowing the snow to continue to pile higher and higher.  In Ukraine, the worst-affected country, well over 100 people have died and more than 3,000 have sought hospital treatment.  State news agency Ukrinform said more than 120 shipsmost of them foreignwere trapped in the Kerch Strait, linking the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea, because of ice.  Parts of the Danube River, one of the most important rivers in Europe for commerce, have nearly frozen over for the first time in 25 years.  That has led at least four countries to halt shipping along sections of the 1,700-mile-long waterway because of the risk of damage to vessels' hulls. The river is also used for drinking water, irrigation and tourism.  The stretch of the Danube running through Romania has been closed indefinitely to traffic, Romanian state television network TVR reported Friday. However, most roads had reopened as of late Thursday, TVR reported, although major problems remain on the country's rail network.  Romania's capital, Bucharest, reached a low of -24 degrees C for the second morning running Friday, its lowest temperature since the cold snap began two weeks ago.  Bucharest has not seen the mercury climb above the 0 degree Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) freezing point since January 24, Miller said. The average high for this time of year is 3 degrees Celsius (37 degrees Fahrenheit).  Snow is lying 11 inches deep in Bucharest but has piled up even higher to the west, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the capital, Sarajevo, has seen over 39 inches accumulate in the past two weeks, Miller said. A year ago, the city was covered by less than half an inch of snow.  The Balkan Peninsula has been hammered with a series of potent snow storms, the result of a jet stream that has sagged much farther south than normal, allowing storms to pick up moisture over the waters of the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and dump it on the already frozen landscape of the Balkans, Miller added.  In Serbia, the death toll from the cold snap rose to 16 on Friday, Interior Ministry emergencies official Predrag Maric told Serbian state news agency Tanjug.  The situation has improved, he is quoted as saying, since the government declared a state of emergency in 38 municipalities. Authorities are now focusing on getting food to people in the worst-affected areas, the news agency said.  Five more people died of hypothermia overnight in Poland, according to the Interior Ministry, the website of the publicly funded Polish Radio reported, taking the total number of cold related deaths there to 97.  Turkish Airlines, the national flag carrier for Turkey, canceled 57 domestic and international flights Friday because of severe weather, the semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported.  In a sign of the extreme weather conditions, the city hospital in Split, Croatia, has used two years' supply of plaster in only five days; a result of treating the high number of fractures caused by slips on the snowy and icy terrain, Miller said.  South-east and western Europe can also expect more wintry weather over the weekend.  Italy is braced Friday for heavy snowfall, with more than 40 deaths blamed on the cold snap so far, according to reports.  La Repubblica newspaper said it was expected to be the most difficult weekend for more than a decade, with the icy conditions extending as far south as Calabria.  Schools and offices were closed in Rome as city workers prepared to cope with as much as a foot of snow overnight. The mayor has issued an order requiring drivers to carry snow chains, and extra salt has been stockpiled for use on the roads.  Heavy snowfall a week ago paralyzed roads and trains in many cities across Italy, leading to wide criticism of authorities.  The number of beds available for homeless people in Rome has almost doubled, from 1,300 to 2,500, and new shelters have been set up in many metro stations, which are being kept open overnight, officials said.  The Six Nations rugby match between Italy and England in Rome will go ahead Saturday as planned, English rugby union officials said.  Some weather-related delays and cancellations have been reported at Italian airports. Train services have been suspended in 12 regions, the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported.  The center-north regions of Emilia Romagna, Abruzzo and Marche, where it has been snowing for several days, have been particularly affected by the bad weather. Local trains are suspended.  In the northern Italian city of Trieste, an icy wind is blowing at more than 80 miles per hour and is expected to strengthen, according to the regional civil protection agency.  An alert has been issued for strong winds over the next 36 hours, as people in the city report finding it difficult to remain standing in the gusts.  The famous canals of Venice started freezing over this week, preventing gondoliers from plying their trade on the city's picturesque waterways.  Many parts of England and Wales saw snow Thursday night and Friday morning.

 Congress might cut most of the federal funding for your local poison control center, which could mean a longer wait during your next poison-related emergency.  Measure H.R. 1 would cut $27.3 million, or about 93%, of federal funding for poison control centers across the United States. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate on March 9.  Congressional leaders now need to negotiate a final spending measure, and that bill might include cuts to the poison control centers.  "My feeling is that just based on my experience, it would end up costing lives somewhere along the way," says Jo Anne Bryant, a nurse with 30 years experience who recently called a poison center when her husband, Ronald, accidentally inhaled pesticide fumes while cleaning out the garage. "I've dealt with some emergencies in this field over my career, but I was completely at a loss as to what to do. When it came to this, I felt completely helpless."  Bryant dialed the national poison center hot line 1-800-222-1222 and was told to take her husband to the hospital if he had specific symptoms, including vomiting. He'd already thrown up, so they headed to the emergency department, where he was treated and released.  It's not just the patients  Hospitals rely on poison control centers, too.  Poison centers answered 4.2 million calls in 2009, and about 16% of those calls came from hospitals seeking their expertise.  "After the hospital did their initial treatment," says Bryant, "they also called the poison control center to verify that they had administered the correct treatment."  What about when you dial 911? They call your poison center, too. When the 911 operators figure out your emergency is poisoning related, they conference in the poison center for a three-way conversation.  That's because the poison center staff answering phone calls include nurses, physicians and pharmacists with specialized poison center training, and there is always a toxicologist on call.  "If we're not around, you better tell your 911 operator to strap their belts on to answer a whole lot of calls that they don't know a damn thing about and can't safely manage that patient at home," says Mark Ryan, director of the Louisiana Poison Center.  Spending here, saving there  Poison control center operators say their services save health care dollars, primarily because most callers are told they don't need a hospital. Eliminating call centers could increase unnecessary trips to the hospital, further burdening the health care system, they say.  "Poison centers treat nearly 75% of all exposure cases at home, without the patient having to go to a health care facility," said Jim Hirt, executive director of the American Association of Poison Control Centers, in a written statement. "The costs of this cut would ultimately far exceed the $27 million saved."  According to a study cited by the Department of Health and Human Services, for every dollar spent on poison control centers, $7 in health care spending is saved. Other studies find the per dollar value of poison control centers to be far greater.  Louisiana has already been down this road. Because of state budget cuts, the Louisiana Poison Center closed on October 31, 1988.  The percentage of patients treated at home dropped to 28.6%, from 74.1% before the center closed, according to a 1991 study published in the Southern Medical Journal.  The Louisiana Poison Center reopened in 1992, because the additional health care costs outweighed the savings, and because of stories like Peggy Toner's.  Toner's 2-year-old daughter swallowed an antibiotic cream one day in 1990. With the Louisiana Poison Center closed, she called another state's poison center for help, but the staff was instructed not to help her, because the state where she lived, Louisiana, was not paying for their poison center services.  "It was the most horrible feeling in the world," says Toner. "What if my daughter died because they wouldn't help me?"  She then called a Kentucky poison center, where she got help.  Creating one national call center  The cuts in federal funding would eliminate all but one of the nation's 57 poison control centers, which rely heavily on federal funding.  Click here to see how many federal dollars your local poison control center receives.  "There's just no reason to maintain 57 separate call centers around the country when technology would enable us to get the job done with one," said a statement from Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Montana, chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Health and Human Services. "We can save millions simply by cutting out 56 duplicative locations and with record debt and deficits putting our future in jeopardy, it's worth looking under every rock for savings."  Poison control center operators strongly disagree.  "Local relationships are invaluable" says Ryan of Louisiana. "There's no way a single center could get in there and provide for the wants and needs of every state. It's not possible."  He also warns of putting all resources in a single entity.  "What happens if the hypothetical 'single' center gets wiped out by a tornado and the infrastructure is destroyed? Where are those 12,000+ calls each day going to go?"  Many health care studentsdoctors, nurses, pharmacists, EMTsreceive formal toxicology training from their local center. "Who else knows what we know?" says Ryan.  It is unclear how one enormous center would be funded, or in which state it would be.  "If you want the same number of people to be answered," says Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, "suddenly you need to have probably six- or seven-hundred people working in a single poison control center."  Proponents of the one-center plan cite innovation in private business and say government could follow the example to be more efficient.  "If you look at things like bookstores or movie rental stores, with internet technology, where long distances really aren't an issue anymore, what they do is they save a ton of money by putting everything in a single warehouse," said one congressional staffer speaking anonymously.  Could it work?  Many call centers already serve areas far beyond their locale.  A call center in Nebraska also handles emergencies in American Samoa and Micronesia. Oregon serves Guam. A Jacksonville, Florida, call center serves the Virgin Islands. And MontanaRehberg's stateis served by the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center, which also handles Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho and Nevada, negotiating rates with each state.  Cell phones also make out-of-state poison emergencies a common thing.  Timing the announcement with National Poison Prevention Week, which began Sunday, the American Association of Poison Control Centers will release an iPhone app to help users dial the poison control hot line. Those calls, like all cell phone calls, may ring at the nearest poison control center, or not.  "Every single center gets calls from other states almost daily," says Ryan. "Two or three a day; we see it more with certain carriers than others."  Still, poison center operators insist that local matters.  "I think it was just an ill-informed decision by somebody who, let's just hope, was new on the scene," says Lopez about the proposed budget cuts, "and wasn't that ill-informed after lots of experience."

 Cruising a luxurious superyacht with your own custom-built limousine onboard, ready for offshore jaunts, sounds like an experience fit only for royalty.  Likewise, lounging in your very own salon designed by one of the biggest fashion houses in the world could perhaps come with a lifestyle limited to supermodels.  But it need not be just for kings and queens or even leading fashionistas. The Sovereign superyacht can be anyone's, that is, if they have around $132m to spare.  Sovereign is the brainchild of Gray Design who insist the finer details of the superyacht would please monarchs around the world.  Gray Design specializes in high-end, luxury yachts that often incorporate designer cars. Sovereign is no exception with its sleek lines inspired by a limousine.  "We thought about a typical person on board one of these yachts and asked: how do they travel on land? Well limousine," says Gray Design CEO Eduard Gray. "It's a very unique concept in the yacht world."  The matching custom-built car is an added extra, but regardless if the new owner requests one or not, there will be space on the yacht for a garage to store their wheels whilst they are at sea. If the owner's car are left at home, the garage becomes an ideal area to store all the boat's toys such as jet skis.  Designers say production will start in the coming months. "The plans are so advanced that ship builders can bring production by the end of the year," says Gray. "It's not conceptual anymore; it's gone into the engineering stage."  The design team is now in talks with potential owners about special modifications to suit their tastes, including working with fashion house Armani to fit out the interiors.  Discussions are also underway to install a patch of grass out the back as a makeshift golfing green that can also be used for a play area for the potential owner's dog.  At the back end of the yacht, is a circular infinity pool that surrounds a reinforced glass helipad. The latter also acts as a skylight for the room below. There's space for ten guest suites, in addition to the owner's quarters, as well as a cinema, gym, nightclub and library.  But the Sovereign is not simply designed for luxury, she can reach speeds of up to 30 knots. "It's the most high performance 100 meter yacht ever," says Gray.

For a company that hasn't attended CES since 1992, Apple dominates the show.  You can't walk more than a dozen feet here at the Las Vegas Convention Center without seeing an iGadget or iAccessory of some kind. Apple's overwhelming presence by proxy is impressive, and underscores the immense place the company occupies in the consumer electronics sector.  Of the 3,000 or so exhibitors here at CES, nearly 500 reside in the iLounge pavilion, a section dedicated specifically to Apple-related products. And then there are the hundreds of audio, automotive, health, gaming, and accessory companies hawking iOS and Mac peripherals.  There are more iPhone and iPad adaptors, docks and dongles than you could possibly imagine. Vendors are showing off iPad camera rigs, solar-powered Mac batteries and even an iPhone-connected plant sensor. And then there's the sea of bedazzled and bedecked iPhone and iPad cases.  The biggest reason for this is, of course, Apple's dominating presence in the consumer electronic space. It's a lot easier for startups and established players alike to ride Apple's coattails than those of, say, Google or Microsoft.  "We know that Apple is doing well," said Howard Cheng, Just Mobile's director of operations. "We know that it's better to make Apple products than anything else."  Another advantage to going down the iRoute is Apple's tight focus on a few products and form factors. It's far easier to tailor accessories to Apple than anyone else.  "Accessory makers can reach virtually the entire installed base of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch owners with two products, determined by the connector," the 30 pin or Lightning, said Charles Govin, an industry analyst with Forrester. "Similarly, a case maker must create many SKUs for the Android market, but essentially only three (iPhone 3G, 4, and 5) for the entire iPhone market."  The relative ease with which companies can develop peripherals for Apple is made all the more appealing by the fact Apple customers have proven themselves only too happy to shell out money to accessorize their iDevices.  "Apple owners have a demonstrated willingness to spend for accessories, cases, and other customizations," Govin said. "Essentially, the potential return on investment is more promising for Apple-related products."  CES also shows just how willing people are to build on Apple's iconic "i" branding. There's iLounge, iBattz, iSkin, iConnectivity, iPort and even iCat all within a few feet of each other on the show floor. Spend five minutes walking the floor and it becomes clear there's no need for Apple to be here. Hundreds of companies are only too happy to carry Cupertino's banner.  Apple's presence here has grown rapidly. In the three years since the iLounge Pavilion launched, the space has quadrupled to 120,000 square feet, all but taking over an entire hall and pushing the automotive industry into another space.  But does anyone wish Apple were actually here? Not really.  "I don't care," said Raymond Meng, president of iSmartAlarm. His company is releasing an iPhone-controlled home alarm system, which Meng says was inspired by the burglary of Steve Jobs' house this summer. Meng said that it doesn't matter that Apple isn't at CES with a booth or keynote, because CES is already the most successful and popular show for companies like his.  Cheng, from Just Mobile, agrees. "At this point, I don't think Apple needs to be here," he said. "They have their own events and that works for them."  Just Mobile already has eight products in the Apple Store and uses CES to expand into the international market and meet clients. As for meetings with Apple, "We visit them at their campus," Cheng said.  Of course, CES could be a much hotter destination if it had the hottest tech company involved. With Microsoft dropping out, CES is losing even more of its sizzle. But the CEA, the organization that puts on the show, says that Apple skipping out isn't a big deal.  "Apple is a CEA member. It's just there prerogative to not exhibit and they've found it more cost effective to host their own events," CEA spokeswoman Danielle Cassagnol said. "They've never keynoted or exhibited at CES, so them not being here isn't really a loss for us."  That's not entirely true, since Apple did introduce the Newton at CES in 1992, but perhaps the CEA wants to forget this fact. But the fact remains that Apple and its products are the widely seen, and discussed, at CES. It's here, even if it isn't.  "They have employees that attend the show, so in that way, Apple sort of is here," Cassognal said.  Follow: Wired's live coverage of CES  Follow: CNN Tech's live coverage of CES  
 Washington Taxes, religion and educationthis politically charged trifecta divided the Supreme Court on Wednesday in a case involving a state school choice program.  At issue is a lawsuit challenging Arizona's tax breaks for voluntary donations benefiting private school scholarships. The 13-year-old program provides dollar-for-dollar income tax breaks for money given to "school tuition organizations," or STOs.  Some Arizona taxpayers challenged the program as unconstitutional because, they say, not-for-profit religious organizations award most of the scholarships, and require children to enroll in religious schools. Those opponents say the state has effectively been funneling taxpayer money to religious schools through a third-party "front" group.  The justices appeared torn over whether that represented a de facto "endorsement" of religion by Arizona.  "The state could not give tuition vouchers on the basis of religion-- could not say, if you are a Catholic you don't get these tuition vouchers," said Justice Elena Kagan, who was impressive in her command of the complex issues argued. "But what the state has done here, apparently, is to set up a scheme that uses intermediaries that can make exactly that distinction, that can say-- sorry, if you are a Catholic you don't get scholarships out of our STO."  One key issue for the court is whether the tax credit means the donated amount is the government's money or an individual's.  "There is a very important philosophical point here. You think that all the money belongs to the government, except to the extent that it deigns to allow private people to keep some of it," Justice Samuel Alito told a lawyer for the taxpayer plaintiffs. "They don't owe it to the government if they have made this contribution. That's the whole point."  Besides the church-state questions, the high court must decide whether individual residents have "standing" to sue the state, even if they do not donate to the scholarship program. That could be the key legal point the justices decide to tackle, aside from the larger state-action debate.  The growing popularity of school choice plans around the country has raised fresh legal questions about whether Arizona's plan is religion-neutral, and whether parents have true decision-making power, free from government intervention.  A federal appeals court ruled the decade-old lawsuit could proceed.  In 2002, the Supreme Court separately upheld school voucher programs. Supporters of the Arizona aid program say theirs is no different from the Cleveland program approved eight years ago, because in both cases, government does not direct any money to religious schools.  Arizonans can receive a $500 credit ($1,000 for a couple filing jointly) off their state income taxes for contributions to school tuition organizations, which operate as charities. These organizations must spend at least 90 percent of money received on scholarships, and must offer them to students at more than one school. Parents would apply for the tax-credit funded scholarships at either a religious or secular school.  State figures show more than 50 school tuition organizations had received about $400 million in contributions through last year. In 2009 the program provided 27,000 scholarships to 373 schools, with most going to students who would not have been able to afford to attend.  An Arizona Republic newspaper investigation found that of the $54 million in scholarships awarded in 2008, 93 percent went to students attending religious schools.  Four Arizona taxpayers had sued the state and some of the largest school tuition organizations. The plaintiffs are represented by various outside groups including the American Civil Liberties Union.  In oral arguments, the divided bench struggled over whether these four Arizona taxpayers could claim they were directly affected by how the scholarship money was spent, and whether the program was funded by money from the government or private contributors.  Arguing for the Obama administration, Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal defended the state program, saying parents ultimately control where the scholarship money is spent. "If you placed an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the [suing taxpayers] pay in tax, not a cent, not a fraction of a cent, would go into any religious school's coffers," he said.  Several left-leaning justices appeared unconvinced. Echoing the arguments of the taxpayer plaintiffs, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, "Either you pay it to the state [in taxes] or you use it for this [school] purpose, but it's the state's money and it's given you by its largesse, the right to redirect it."  "Does anyone have standing, in your view, to challenge this scheme?" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked the government lawyer. "The Establishment Clause will be unenforceable unless we recognize taxpayer standing."  "Suppose that an STOthis is a hypothetical casediscriminated on the basis of race. No Hispanic or no white or no black can receive our money," said Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could well prove the deciding vote in this appeal.  "Don't you think a strong argument can be made that it can be attributed to the state," allowing a private individual discrimination claim to be made. "The state has all sorts of rules about what an STO has to be. The state provides the mechanism through the credit for the funding."  Kagan added, "There are STOs that make these distinctions that clearly would be impermissible if the state administered the program."  Paul Bender, attorney for the plaintiffs by contrast, faced tough questioning from several conservative justices over the state action.  "How is it discriminating on the basis of religion if the STO doesn't care whether it goes to a religious school or not? It's treated the same?" asked Chief Justice John Roberts.  "That doesn't matter. If the state's grantee cares, that's unconstitutional," said Bender, an Arizona State University professor. "This is a government spending program. Is there any doubt about that? The money in this program is not private charitable contributions."  "It's a great leap to say that it's government funds, that any money the government doesn't take from me because it gives me a deduction, is government money," said Justice Antonin Scalia. "This money has never been in the government's coffers. The government has declined to take this money."  Taxpayers are generally limited in their ability to claim constitutional wrongdoing over government spending. A special class was carved by the high court 42 years ago for some kinds of disputes related to the First Amendment's prohibition on government "establishment of religion."  The current cases are Arizona Christian School Tuition Org. v. Winn (09-987) and Garriott v. Winn (09-991). A ruling is expected sometime next year.

At a college reunion, it's common for alumni to share post-collegiate achievements with each other.  But a report compiled for this year's 50th reunion class at Harvard University contained an unusual entry.  Ted Kaczynski, the so-called "Unabomber" and Harvard alumnus, listed his eight life sentences for a string of bombings that killed three people and wounded 23 others as an "award" in the class of 1962 report.  The Harvard Alumni Association said in a statement Thursday that they "regret publishing Kaczynski's references to his convictions and apologize for any distress that it may have caused others."  The Boston Globe published an apparent photo of the entry, which lists Kaczynski's occupation as "prisoner" and his address as "No 04475-046, US Penitentiary-Max, P.O. Box 8500, Florence, CO 8126-8500."  In the section where alumni list their awards, Kaczynski's entry reads: "eight life sentences, issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, 1998."  Kaczynski's entry was published in a class reunion report, which was distributed in advance of the 1962 reunion.  All members of the class who submit their own entries are included in each year's report, according to the alumni association.  Kaczynski was arrested in 1996 and pleaded guilty in 1998 for sending bombs through the mail from 1978 to 1995.  
 Washington Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich made it official Wednesday: He's running for president.  The Georgia Republican announced via Twitter that he is formally seeking the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.  Gingrich is widely viewed as the most serious official Republican candidate so far.  "I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States because I believe we can return America to hope and opportunity," the former speaker said in a campaign video posted online.  "We Americans are going to have to talk together, to work together, find solutions together, and insist on imposing those solutions on those forces that don't want to change."  The candidate called for more jobs, a balanced budget and decentralized government.  "There are some people who don't mind if America becomes a wreck so long as they dominate the wreckage," Gingrich said. "But you and I know better."  "Let's get together, look reality in the face, tell the truth, make the tough choices and get the job done," he declared.  "There's a much better American future ahead."  House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said earlier Wednesday that "the discussion around the presidential race will obviously increase" when Gingrich entered the race for the GOP nomination.  "I think Gingrich has always been an ideas man, and I'm sure that will provide a lot of positive input to the debate," Cantor said.  Gingrich's online announcement followed a recent trend by national politicians to make major announcements through the Internet.  Barack Obama first announced his selection of Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 on his campaign website and in a text message to supporters. Then-Sen. Hillary Clinton announced her presidential candidacy in 2007 with the release of a statement and video on her campaign website.  Asked about his embracing of technology to make his announcement, Gingrich told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Wednesday night that "there are a lot of principles that haven't changed."  He came out swinging against Obama, the "elite" media and Hollywood.  Obama should be ashamed of himself for "dishonest scare tactics" in comments about Republican approaches to the budget and immigration, Gingrich said, adding he wanted to "clear away the liberal policies."  The candidate has traveled to key early voting states trying to build a network of support and has met with fundraisers. He has assembled a campaign team and told supporters he aims to raise $100 million.  During his appearances, the former speaker has pushed a wide array of policy proposals in his bid to lay the foundation of a campaign and prove he is a serious candidate, not just a symbol of the past.  "I expect the American people in the end will be remarkably fair. They'll render judgment, and they'll decide whether or not Newt Gingrich is somebody that they think can solve the country's problems and be the kind of leader they want for this country," Gingrich told Fox News in March.  He has given his audiences a lot of political red meat and has not shied away from controversy.  Speaking at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition event in March, he said there is a difference between a majority of Americans and "the secular socialist people around (President Barack) Obama and the degree to which they do not understand America, cannot possibly represent America and cannot lead us to success."  Gingrich has an agenda the includes overturning the health care reform bill, eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency, pushing more development of energy sources and advocating tax cuts.  "He is a polarizing figure (who) comes with a fair degree of baggage," Ford O'Connell, who worked on the 2008 McCain-Palin ticket, told CNN. He said Gingrich has to make himself relevant to the current political climate. "He does represent the past but has to show why he represents the future," O'Connell said, adding that he thinks right now Gingrich is having difficulty doing that.  "If he can demonstrate why he is relevant to the future in the current political climate," O'Connell said, "the baggage will dissipate."  Some Republican activists not affiliated with a campaign have said Gingrich might not be disciplined enough to focus his ideas to run a successful campaign.  Pollster David Winston, who worked with Gingrich during his years in the House, said he can.  "There isn't any question Newt Gingrich is a person with lots of ideas," Winston told CNN. "The step for Newt here is to not just merely focus on the future ... (but to) focus on the problems the country is most worried about."  Gingrich told Hannity he is better equipped to be president than when he left office 12 years ago.  "It's fair to say I am more mature," he said. "I have had time to reflect on what worked and what didn't work."  He declined to list who his strongest Republican foe might be, instead saying the focus is on the president.  The former House speaker, who converted to Catholicism, the religion of his current wife, has especially reached out to the social conservative wing of the party, a segment critical to success in the key states of Iowa and South Carolina.  Many of those activists are skeptical of Gingrich because of his two divorces.  "There's no question at times of my life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked far too hard and things happened in my life that were not appropriate," Gingrich explained to the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody.  After the Georgia Republican lost two runs for Congress in the 1970s, his third attempt in 1978 was successful. He was aggressive and rose to the second spot in the House Republican leadership. He was instrumental in helping to craft the 1994 Contract with America, a blueprint that helped the Republicans take control of the House. He was elected speaker but, after a disappointing GOP showing in the House elections in 1998, he decided to retire in 1999.  He then went about rehabilitating his political career, forming a conservative policy think tank called American Solutions, starting a string of successful businesses and becoming a political commentator. He has an impressive record of fundraising, he has developed a large network of supporters and he has authored almost two dozen books and produced movies on a wide range of topics.  Gingrich still has some work to do on his reputation.  Forty-four percent of those surveyed in a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll said they had an unfavorable opinion of him, while 30% said they had a favorable one. That gives him one of the largest unfavorable rankings of the GOP presidential contenders, although it also shows he has high name recognition.  When Republicans are asked who they favor for the nomination, 10% choose Gingrich, tying him with Rep. Ron Paul of Texas but behind Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney, Donald Trump and Mike Huckabee.  "He brings a lot to the debate. But there are a lot of candidates in the process of going through a presidential primary. We'll sort out the good from the bad, and we'll end up with a good candidate," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said on NBC's "Today" show Tuesday regarding a Gingrich candidacy.  It has not been all smooth sailing as Gingrich tested the waters. He admitted his advisers flubbed the initial announcement in March that he was exploring a run and starting a website, when expectations were built up that they would announce a more formal step.  "It led to unfortunate confusion," he told the Des Moines Register. "I wish we had been a little more structured ... but I don't take it as a serious problem."  Gingrich also drew some criticism for not giving a coherent critique of the Obama administration's policy on Libya. He told Fox News on March 7, when asked what he would do, that he would "exercise a no-fly zone this evening." But later, after a no-fly zone was put in place, he said on NBC's "Today Show" that "I would not have intervened. I think there are a lot of other ways to affect (Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi."  For his part, Gingrich has denied he flip-flopped, saying he was just commenting on the circumstances as they changed. He posted on his Facebook page: "President Obama said publicly that 'it's time for Gadhafi to go.' Prior to this statement there were options to be indirect and subtle to achieve this result without United States military forces."  "The president, however, took those options off the table with his public statement," he continued. "That's why during a March 7th Greta van Susteren interview, I asserted that the president should establish a no-fly zone 'this evening.' "  CNN's Rebecca Stewart and Alan Silverleib contributed to this story.  
	 'NEW: Gingrich says he is "more mature" than he was when '
Simply put, it's impossible to imagine the past 50 years of rock without Lou Reed, who died Sunday at 71.  Glam rock, punk and various strains of '80s and '90s indie and alternative rock would simply vanish without his example. Every New York rocker in a black leather jacket, from the Ramones to the Strokes, stands in Reed's shadow. David Bowie's early gender-bending persona was explicitly in Reed's debt.  His songbook was a building block for rock's front ranks in the '80s and '90s: R.E.M., Nirvana, U2. Even peers of his band the Velvet Underground looked up to it. The Rolling Stones' 1968 song "Stray Cat Blues," Mick Jagger later admitted, came from trying to emulate sound of the Velvets' "Heroin."  Appreciation: Lou Reed, the minimalist god  Yet Reed was the first rock star that wasn't actually a star. Only one of the four classic albums he made with the Velvet Underground from 1967 to 19701969's "The Velvet Underground"made the "Billboard" album chart, peaking at just 197.  He would not climb high on the chart until 1972, when his solo single "Walk on the Wild Side"produced by Bowiereached No. 16, a position he never again came near.  "If something of mine ever got popular, maybe I could've stuck with that," he told Spin in 2008. "But that was never the point. I had other goals."  And those were long-term. "You may be drawing a circle for the thousandth time," he told Esquire in 2000, "but maybe it's a slightly better circle."  Nevertheless, he became infamousand grew visibly weary of being infamousfor singing about pursuing pleasures of the flesh well past the mandates of healthy, polite society.  Bob Dylan had opened pop songwriting up to just about any topic, but Reed's refusal to flinch while singing about sadomasochism (1967's "Venus in Furs," or the 1969 recording "Foggy Notion," released on the great 1985 outtakes compilation "VU") and hard drugs on "I'm Waiting for the Man" and "Heroin" (both 1967) was unheard of in rock 'n' rollor really any music. So were the screeching, feedback-laden guitars.  That thorniness was ingrained in Reed's public persona, in his unflinching demeanor and permanently alienated worldview.  John Cale, his old Velvet Underground band mate, described Reed as gratuitously vicious, once "the most difficult person to work with I have ever known." Reed was, by many accounts, a fearsome challenge to interview; an anthology could be made of his most withering journalistic encounters (such as the Spin Q&A above).  Artistically, Reed could be equally contrarian.  In 1975, he issued a double-LP, "Metal Machine Music," containing over an hour of machine-generated feedback, to critical howls, dismal sales and irritated fans. Reed didn't care.  His last release, 2011's "Lulu"a heavily improvisational collaboration with Metallicawas similarly derided. Chuck Klosterman, writing in Grantland, called it "appalling," while Pitchfork gave it a 1.0 (out of 10.0). As ever, Reed proudly did whatever he damn well felt like.  As a guitarist and songwriter, he practiced a conscious musical primitivism. The quote from Reed flying around Twitter the fastest in the wake of his death goes: "One chord is fine. Two chords are pushing it. Three chords, and you're into jazz."  But rock was Reed's lifeline. In a 1966 magazine essay written before the Velvet Underground took off, Reed declared, "The only decent poetry of this century was that recorded on rock-and-roll records." While that may have been an exaggerationReed studied under poet Delmore Schwartz at Syracuse University and was in that poet's thrall for the rest of his lifeit candidly reflected his ardor for the music.  Having done so much to inspire punk and post-punk, Reed became a paterfamilias of the New York rock scene around CBGB's and Max's Kansas City in the 1970s; one of his finest solo albums, 1978's "Street Hassle," nodded to that scene. (It also featured a vocal cameo from another fan, Bruce Springsteen.)  It was the beginning of the phenomenon rock producer Brian Eno would allude to in 1982 interview with journalist Kristine McKenna, when he noted that while a relatively modest number of people bought copies of 1967's "The Velvet Underground & Nico," everyone who bought one started a band.  That process accelerated through the '80s. By 1986, Black Francis of Boston's Pixieswhose sneak-attack approach to loud choruses was adapted by, among others, Nirvanawas singing "I wanna be a singer like Lou Reed" on the band's first release, "Come on Pilgrim."  Punk rock and its many offspring weren't all that Reed touched.  In 1990, the rap group A Tribe Called Quest sampled Herbie Flowers' rolling bass line from "Walk on the Wild Side" on its hit, "Can I Kick It." Reed was a longstanding hip-hop fan; one of his last public acts was publishing a widely read paean to Kanye West's "Yeezus."  "There are moments of supreme beauty and greatness on this record, and then some of it is the same old s---" Reed wrote. "But the guy really, really, really is talented."  Sounds a lot like the guy who wrote it.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michaelangelo Matos.  
 Syria is a Hell on Earth that is expanding in plain sight.  The death toll there has doubled in a year's time, if an opposition group is right.  Since civil war broke out there, 310,000 people have been killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday. A year earlier, SOHR's tally stood at 162,402. And the year before, the United Nations put the death toll at 70,000.  Violence has plunged well over half of all Syrians into such destitution that they are in dire need of survival aid, the United Nations says, as food rations are being cut for lack of donations.  Numbers alone can't convey the immeasurable anguish of millions, but maybe it can remind the rest of us of the magnitude of the world's currently greatest tragedy.  The number of years since perpetual bloodshed began, since dictator Bashar al-Assad's security forces fired on crowds of demonstrators and armed militant groups rose up against him in March 2011.  Percentage of the Syrian population killed. It would be like killing 3 to 4 million Americans. The range comes from the SOHR's death toll of 310,000 and a recent lower estimate by the U.N. of at least 220,000 dead.  The number of Syrians in need of immediate life-saving aid, according to the U.N.  That's the population of Moscow.  Syrians driven from their homes, the U.N. says. Imagine the entire Boston metropolitan area emptied out.  Syrians who have fled as refugees to neighboring countries, creating humanitarian and economic hardship across Syria's borders. Turkey has taken in 1.7 million, Lebanon 1.2 million, Jordan 625,000, and Iraq 245,000.  The reduction in the size of food rations the World Food Programme says it has been forced to make due to a lack of donations. That means people receiving aid will get only 60% of the daily nutrition they need.

Fat Tuesday is rolling up fast, so we asked for your recommendations for New Orleans' very best dishes.  "Excess is the new moderation," one iReporter proclaimed. Debatable, but not a bad mantra for a trip to diner's paradise. If you're not hungry now, you will be.  Oysters every which way  Tucked into a baguette, charbroiled, fried, smothered in butter and cheese, sprinkled with bacon or just slurped right out of the shell, oysters turn up in many a New Orleans memory.  The charbroiled variety from Drago's made a big impression on Heather Ackerly, a South Louisiana transplant. "The rich butter and garlic mixed with the fresh saltwater taste of the oyster is heaven. And before you know itthe oysters are gone. But that wonderful butter and herb sauce remains, waiting for you to soak it up with the French bread."  Felix's Oyster Bar gets iReporter Lulis Leal's vote. "Whether served ice cold on the half shell, chargrilled and sizzling in garlic butter or fried to golden perfection, Felix's oysters are some of the best you'll ever have," Leal said.  Eatocracy: What NOT to do during Mardi Gras  There's nothing better than the standard oyster po' boy, "dressed, lots of Crystal," said Judy Pfau Hull of Rochester, New York. She likes Domilise's, Tracey's, Franky & Johnny's and Central Grocery for sandwiches.  "The wonderful thing about New Orleans cuisine is it really doesn't matter if you have $100 to spend or $10, you can always get something truly special," she said.  Local Ed Killeen goes just blocks from his home in Old Metairie to Zeke's for the "most stupendously crisp and fresh oyster po' boys!"  A proper po' boy requires lightly toasted French bread, real butter, crisp lettuce and pickles, thin-sliced tomato and "most of all, freshly fried oysters," Killeen wrote in his iReport.  Mardi Gras beyond bare breasts  A sandwich known 'round the world  Po' boys aren't the only world-famous sandwiches to come out of the Crescent City. The Central Grocery on Decatur Street is widely touted as the source of the original muffuletta, a sandwich of layered Italian meats, cheeses and olive salad on a flat round loaf of muffuletta bread. The sandwich has been replicated and interpreted, but Leal calls the Central Grocery's sandwich "definitive."  "Yes, other restaurants now make fatter ones on artisan breads with more exotic cold cuts and fancier ingredients in the olive salad, but Central Market's muffuletta has a classic dignity that simply cannot be bettered," she said.  Eatocracy: Lick-the-screen muffuletta  Steven Wolfe of Houston urges diners to order a whole sandwich to stave off regrets. "No other sandwich is so perfectly designed for proportion, texture and combination of tastes."  He's a fan of really communing with the muffuletta, so he suggests taking it back to your hotel room, "where you can have a private experience with the sandwich, away from the eyes of strangers," he wrote on iReport.com. Recline after you dine.  "By the time you're ready to walk around, cocktail hour should be creeping up on the Quarter. A cold Abita and a few oysters sounds lovely. Give in," Wolfe advised.  Eatocracy: What we ate in New Orleans  More fruits of the sea  Kristen Hendrix had an unforgettable taste of her husband's crab cake pasta at Oceana Grill. "It was so rich and creamy, just the right amount of seafood flavor to it," she said.  "We have tried to replicate it at home with no success so far," said Hendrix, who lives in Charleston, Illinois.  The alligator sausage cheesecake appetizer at Jacques-Imo's received two iReporter endorsements. Richard Senger of The Woodlands, Texas, called it "inexplicable."  Mariel Metzenthin of Overland Park, Kansas, went for it with this description: "The look on everyone's face at the table was the same, 'Damn!'eyes wide, mouths full and forks going in for seconds. The texture was smoother than a quiche, yet not as rich as the traditional cheesecake and the alligator sausage gave the right amount of bite."  When he's in New Orleans, former Louisiana resident Anthony DiFatta always stops at Coop's Place for the cajun pasta, a spicy creamy dish featuring crawfish, oysters, shrimp, artichoke hearts, mushrooms and cajun Tasso ham. He calls this "little dive" of a restaurant the city's best-kept secret.  For true home cooking, Marissa Turner recommends Val's Marina in Maurepas, Louisiana, about an hour's drive from the New Orleans airport. "I make the drive to Val's Marina because it feels like having dinner at my momma's house. And that's saying something," said Turner, who lives in Prairieville, Louisiana.  New Orleans: The food that got them through  A cloud of powdered sugar  What's not to love about fried things doused in powdered sugar? The famous Caf du Monde, established in 1862, popped up several times among iReport contributors. Beignets, French-style square doughnuts, are the main attraction, but coffee mixed with chicory is a natural complement.  "Don't get me wrong, I love touffe, gumbo, po' boys, muffuletta, but I gotta have my oysters and beignets," said Diana Nguyen, who lives in the Chicago suburbs.  More sweet treats  For a more unusual, sucr sal treat, head to Green Goddess. "The standout, not-to-be-missed creation I'm crazy about is the bacon sundae," said Lynn Chen of Los Angeles. She tucked into this concoctionpecan praline ice cream drizzled with bacon caramel sauce, topped with Applewood bacon and whipped creaminstead of cake on her 35th birthday.  And of course bananas Foster, bread pudding and pralines are well-loved New Orleans standards. See the gallery above for recommendations on where to indulge in those.  Breaking away from the local standards  When you've had more oysters, crawfish and beignets than you can bear, veer away from tradition and make new ones. The dining scene in New Orleans is always evolving with fresh twists on the classics and totally original dishes.  "Now really, about all you have to do is walk or drive down the street until you see an eatery. Go inside and 99.9% of the time you will be delighted!" wrote former New Orleans resident Duane Putnam.  Eatocracy: The great gumbo debate  Very fine eateries rub shoulders with casual favorites. Port of Call has earned hearty praise from Sharon Curole, who first encountered this hole-in-the-wall bar's tremendous burger with baked potato before her wedding in December 1995. "Every year since, my husband Chris and I make sure we get down to New Orleans to enjoy it again."  "Get it loaded or 'dressed,' as they say in NOLA," said Curole, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire.  Melinda Green Harvey of Lubbock, Texas, offered another rave for a well-loved sandwich: the Cuban. She found a very tasty version at Cochon Butcher, a hybrid sandwich shop, butcher and wine bar.  "I get it. People go to New Orleans for gumbo, or red beans, or beignets. But when you get tired of that and just want something simple and delicious, head to Cochon Butcher."  
 Brazilian side Santos booked their place in the FIFA Club World Cup final on Wednesday with a 3-1 defeat of Japanese outfit Kashiwa Reysol in Toyota City.  The South American champions will now face either European Champions League winners Barcelona or Qatari side Al Sadd in Sunday's final.  Santos took the lead at the Toyota Stadium after 19 minutes, Brazil forward Neymar displaying dazzling footwork to evade a challenge before curling a delightful shot into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area.  Striker Borges ensured the eight-time Brazilian champions went into half-time with a two-goal lead when he bent a similarly impressive effort into the back of Kashiwa goalkeeper Takanori Sugeno's net.  CNN blog: Is Roberto Mancini the right man for Man City?  J-League champions Kashiwa rallied and dragged themselves back into the contest nine minutes into the second half, when defender Hiroki Sakai headed home Jorge Wagner's corner.  But Muricy Ramalho's team sealed victory just past the hour mark, Brazil full-back Danilo dispatching a long-range free-kick into the bottom corner to end Kashiwa's resistance.  The 20-year-old Danilo is on the verge of leaving Santos, having already agreed a deal to join Portuguese side Porto after the Club World Cup.  Santos are making their first appearance at the Club World Cup in its current format, but won tournament under its previous title of the Intercontinental Cup in both 1962 and 1963.  Barcelona, who claimed the trophy in 2009 and 2006, will be hoping to reach the final for the third time in six years when they face Asian champions Al Sadd on Thursday.  Al Sadd, coached by Uruguayan Jorge Fossati, defeated African Champions League winners Esperance of Tunisia to reach the semifinals.  In the Europa League, French side Paris St Germain beat Group F table-toppers Atletico Bilbao 4-2 but it wasn't enough to stop them crashing out before the round of 32 stage.  Under new Qatari owners, PSG had been one of the favorites for the competition but their fate was sealed by Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg who beat Slovan Bratislava 3-2 in Slovenia to qualify in second.  Turkish outfit Besiktas beat Stoke City 3-1 to seal top spot in Group E as the English Premier League club had to make do with second place. Ukrainian outfit Dynamo Kiev were knocked out after drawing 3-3 with Maccabi Tel-Aviv.  Italian Serie A side Lazio beat already qualified Sporting Lisbon, from Portugal, 2-0 to go through to the knockout stage as runners-up in Group D.  English side Fulham, finalists back in 2010, were on course for a place in the last 32 after claiming a 2-0 lead over Odense BK but the Danish outfit hit back and grabbed a last minute equalizer to knock the London club out.  Fulham's defeat meant Poland's Wisla Krakow went through as runners-up in Group K after a 2-1 victory over Dutch side FC Twente, who had already qualified in first place.  Steaua Bucharest claimed second spot in Group J, the Romanians beating AEK Larnaca, from Cyprus, 3-1. German club Schalke, who had already qualified in top spot, beat Maccabi Haifa, from Israel 3-0.  In Group L, Belgian side Anderlecht beat Lokomotiv Moscow 5-3 to seal top spot in the group. The Russians go through in second.

President Barack Obama called Sunday for a "thorough" and "rigorous" investigation into allegations involving prostitutes and Secret Service agents in Colombia.  Some 11 Secret Service agents and officers are being investigated over preliminary findings that they allegedly brought back several prostitutes to a hotel in Cartagena, U.S. government sources familiar with the investigation have told CNN.  "What happened here in Colombia is being investigated by the director of the Secret Service," said Obama, who spoke in Cartagena, where he was in town for the Summit of the Americas event.  U.S. Secret Service agents sent home from Colombia  "I expect that investigation to be thorough and I expect it to be rigorous. If it turns out that some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course I'll be angry," he said.  The alleged misconduct occurred before Obama arrived in Cartagena. The Secret Service personnel have since been sent back to the United States and put on administrative leave, the agency said. The U.S. military said that five U.S. troops who were working with the Secret Service are also under investigation for missing curfew and alleged "misconduct" at the same Colombian hotel.  "We're representing the people of the United States and when we travel to another county I expect us to observe the highest standards," said Obama. "Obviously what's been reported doesn't match up with those standards."  Leaders debate Cuba, drug war at summit  Still, he cautioned: "I'll wait until the full investigation is completed until I pass final judgment."  None of the agents or officers being investigated was part of the president's personal protective detail and Obama was not based at the Hotel Caribe, where the alleged misconduct occurred. But dignitaries and journalists reporting on the hemispheric meeting were staying there, a U.S. government official said.  Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, was briefed on the matter and told CNN on Saturday that the government personnel brought prostitutes back to their rooms Wednesday night and "one of the women did not leave the room in the morning."  A hotel manager tried to get in the room, and eventually the woman emerged and said "they owed her money," according to King. Similarly, U.S. government sources said there was a dispute between at least one Secret Service member and a woman brought back to his hotel over a request to be paid.  At least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police, and complaints were filed with the U.S. Embassy, the sources said.  "The Secret Service saw that report, and they immediately began an investigation," King said.  Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovon said that the agents were relieved of duty Thursdayprior to the president's arrival in Colombiaand replaced after "allegations of misconduct."  The agency's assistant director, Paul Morrissey, noted his agency's "zero tolerance policy on personal misconduct."  "This incident is not reflective of the behavior of our personnel as they travel every day throughout the country and the world performing their duties in a dedicated, professional manner," Morrissey said Saturday. "We regret any distraction from the Summit of the Americas this situation has caused."  The U.S. military is conducting its own investigation and will mete out "punishment, if appropriate ... in accordance with established policies and the Uniform Code of Military Justice," U.S. Southern Command said in a statement Saturday.  Ronald Kessler, a former Washington Post reporter who has written a book about the Secret Service, called the incident "clearly the biggest scandal in Secret Service history."  The Washington Post, which was the first to report the story, said it was alerted to the investigation by Kessler.  Jon Adlerpresident of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which represents Secret Service agents and other federal law enforcement officersurged caution in jumping to conclusions, characterizing the incident as "isolated" and not necessarily a scandal.  "That's just sort of an overdramatic interpretation of an isolated incident," he said. "We have to trust the process of the internal review."  While soliciting prostitution is legal in certain areas of Colombia, it is considered a breach of the agency's conduct code, the government sources said. High-level officials in the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security were outraged over the incident, the sources said, noting that the investigation indicated the prostitutes were brought back to a hotel that had been secured for the summit.  
 (Coastal Living)The Little Dipper's seven patio tables overlook a twinkling Caribbean. Tonight, the chefwho's also waiter and hostessprepares Creole fish with vegetables. Although the small restaurant is one of the best in Grenada, it's the vista that stands out.  Founded in the late 17th century, the capital city of St. George's sits on the island's southwest coast.  Sailboats sway at anchor on Clarkes Court Bay, and lights blink on against dark green hills. The island's hidden treasure is its viewsand not just from quaint seaside cafs.  Take the nearby resort of Laluna, on Portici Bay. With 16 hillside cottages huddled around a private cove beach, it overflows with scenic panoramas.  Founded by a former fashion consultant from Italy, Laluna is chic, but not pretentiousa stylish retreat on one of the Caribbean's quietest islands. Eco-inspired rooms feature fabric-draped four-poster beds from Bali, individual plunge pools, and bamboo-topped verandas.  The most distant cottage sits 150 feet from the beach, making the resort a barefoot, lounging kind of place. Ultracasual dress code aside, Laluna takes meals seriously.  Dinner comes prepared by an Italian chef who mingles his home country's techniques with Caribbean flavors. You can start with octopus salad with potatoes and chickpeas, then make your way down the menu to pappardelle with a nutmeg cream sauce.  It won't be the last time you see nutmeg on a menu here. Grenada provides a third of the world's supply of the spice, which can be sampled as a powder, syrup, or jam.  Almost every visitor brings some home, usually in a small basket also packed with cloves, cinnamon, mace, bay leaves, and ginger. The country may not claim flashy casinos or high-rise resorts, but Grenada grows more spices per square mile than any other place on the globe. Coastal Living: The other Caribbean  It takes a lush climate, such as the rain forest at Grenada's center, to produce these flavors. Grand Etang National Park preserves the island's tropical flora and fauna.  Visitors can book guides to lead them through terraced banana farms and forests of giant gommier trees, teak, and wild orchids. From a mountain peak, 90 percent of the island is visible, vivid green after a midday rain.  As one might expect, the cities here move at a sleepy, island pace. But the township of Gouyave on Grenada's western coast jumps to life on Fish Fridays, which are part street-food festival, part outdoor concert, and part extended-family gathering. Beginning late afternoon, the fishing village's streets and side passages fill with tables of seafood. Vendors sell sample-size servings of everything from lobster to jerked marlin to deep-fried fish cakes. Music lifts the spirit, as do the enthusiastic greetings of friends and relatives.  Visitors to Gouyave are a little reluctant to leave. But eventually they'll head back to Laluna, along a cliffside road illuminated by stars on a cloudless nightyet another unforgettable view.  Island Info  Laluna's cliffside cottages start at $390. Rates do not include meals, but all snorkeling and kayaking is included; 866/452-5862 or laluna.com. Guided hikes from Henry's Safari Tours cost $40 to $55 per person. Denis Henry offers trips tailored to your experience level. His taxi tours are also the best on the island; 347/721-9271 or henrysafari.com. Reservations at Little Dipper on Clarkes Court Bay in Woburn can be made through Laluna, or by calling 473/444-5136. From Laluna, a round-trip taxi to Fish Fridays in Gouyave costs roughly $100. Food at the festival will run between $15 and $20 per person.

A grand jury has indicted polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs on a second sexual assault charge in connection with a probe of his Texas compound, prosecutors said Wednesday.  The charge against Warren Jeffs stems from a probe into his sect's Yearning for Zion Ranch near Eldorado, Texas.  The Schleicher County, Texas, grand jury charged Jeffs, who already could be sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of a different charge in Utah, with a first-degree felony count of aggravated sexual assault.  The indictment is Jeffs' second in Schleicher County.  In July, he was charged with sexually assaulting a child under 17.  Grand jurors have also indicted three more members of Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, prosecutors said Wednesday. One member faces a count of conducting the unlawful marriage of a minor, another faces three counts of bigamy and a third faces three counts of bigamy and one count of tampering with evidence.  The Texas charges stem from a state and federal investigation into the sect's Yearning for Zion Ranch outside Eldorado, about 190 miles northwest of San Antonio. In April, child welfare workers removed more than 400 children from the compound, citing allegations of physical and sexual abuse.  After a court battle, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the children returned in June, saying the state had no right to remove them and there was no evidence to show the children faced imminent danger of abuse on the ranch.  To date, 12 people associated with the compound have been indicted as part of the investigation, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said.  Jeffs, 52, is the leader and "prophet" of the estimated 10,000-member FLDS, an offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church. The FLDS openly practices polygamy at the YFZ Ranch, as well as in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state lineHildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona.  In Utah, Jeffs was convicted on accomplice to rape charges for his role in the marriage of a sect member to a 14-year-old. He is awaiting trial in Arizona, where he faces similar charges.  He faces a sentence of up to life in prison for the Utah conviction, and he also could face another life term if convicted of the Texas charges.  His attorney in Arizona, Michael Piccarreta, has questioned the motives of Texas authorities, telling CNN in a July interview that the state's investigation into Jeffs and his followers is an effort "to cover themselves up on the botched attack on the ranch in Texas."  
 Islamabad, Pakistan Intense rains let up in parts of northwestern Pakistan on Thursday, giving humanitarian groups a chance to get more aid to the millions of people suffering.  The dry skies were a respite for areas battered by the heavy rains, which left behind bloated rivers and covered whole neighborhoods with flood waters.  But heavy rains were still pounding some parts of the country, including Punjab and Sindh provinces.  The floodingcaused by torrential monsoon rainshas destroyed thousand of homes, crushed many bridges and affected 3 million people, officials said.  As many as 1,500 people have died in what has been called Pakistan's worst flooding in 70 years.  "Today is going better. It is sunny and drier, but the destruction is all around us. Most of the villages have been washed away by water," said Joseph Prior Tio, who's working with Doctors Without Borders in Pakistan's Swat Valley.  Another big issue is the many left without electricity, Tio said.  "We are fighting to get safe water to many areas," Tio said "There is simply no electricity anywhere in the entire valley. All over the valley there are about 1 million people who depended on electricity to get basic services such as safe drinking water."  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday urged Americans to donate to relief efforts, saying that experience in post-earthquake Haiti showed that small donations can make a big difference.  Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani appealed to residents to curtail expenditures for Ramadan feasts and upcoming independence day celebrations, and instead help their suffering compatriots.

A former Mexican senator was reported missing on Saturday, Mexico's attorney general's office said.  The case has rocked Mexico, with President Felipe Calderon saying he is closely monitoring the investigation into the disappearance of the former official, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos Ramos.  The attorney general of the state where Fernandez de Cevallos was reported missing said that authorities have no clues as to his whereabouts.  Fernandez de Cevallos was last seen on the ranch of his home in Pedro Escobedo, in central Mexico's state of Queretaro, the country's official Notimex news agency reported.  The attorney general's office said that Fernandez de Cevallos' vehicle was located on his ranch and that "in the place where the car was located, some of his belongings were found and there were traces of violence."  Queretaro attorney Arsenio Duran said the former legislator had arrived alone at his La Cabana ranch, as he usually did, at approximately 11 p.m. Friday (midnight ET Saturday) and that it was presumed that he was kidnapped in the driveway of his property, Notimex reported.  Duran said that around 7 a.m. Saturday (8 a.m. ET) relatives of the former legislator noticed that the door to his truck was open, Notimex reported. Outside the vehicle were discarded glasses, pens and scissors; inside were traces of blood.  The federal attorney general's office has declined to call the case a kidnapping.  Queretaro authorities are investigating the case, the attorney general's office said.  A statement on the Mexican president's website said that Calderon "from the first hours of the morning, has been in constant communication with the attorney general and with the secretaries of Interior and Public Security," about the investigation.  The statement said that Calderon has "communicated with one of the two children of Fernandez de Cevallos, who is facing this difficult situation with integrity, to offer his solidarity and the necessary backing to successfully locate Fernandez de Cevallos."  The missing legislator was a senator from PAN, Mexico's National Action Party, and is a former presidential candidate. The statement on Calderon's website called Fernandez de Cevallos "a key politician in the Mexican democratic transition."  CNN's Esprit Smith contributed to this report.  
 Arctic reindeer herders in northern Scandinavia are getting a view from space to help them look after their herds as the region copes with climate change.  Snow worries: Satellite maps of snow coverage and melt can help reindeer herders.  Using satellite-based snow melt maps supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) backed program Polar View, herders are able to view the depth of snow and judge where the best foraging spots are to take their reindeer.  "Snow is of paramount importance for reindeer herding, because its quality determines whether reindeer are able to access the pastures that lie beneath it for much of the year," Anders Oskal, the Director of the International Center for Reindeer Husbandry (ICR) told the ESA.  "Detailed circumpolar snow information is, thus, becoming increasingly important following the recent changes in the Arctic climate."  Oskal is working with Smi reindeer herders in Finnmark, Norway, to help them maintain and develop sustainable reindeer husbandry.  According to Oskal, Finnmark is the area of Norway that is predicted to experience the largest temperature increases, raising concerns about whether ice layers will form over pastures preventing reindeer from foraging.  Under the Polar View initiative, Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) have been providing snow melt maps for Norway and Sweden, as well as snow cover maps for Eurasia, for the last 18 months.  The ICR partnered with Polar View in a trial of the maps to examine how satellite observations could help by gathering information on snow change in a timely manner for such vast circumpolar regions.  "The experience so far has definitely been positive, and the reindeer herders are extremely interested in the future utilization of Polar View products that can relate important information about local snow conditions," said Oskal.  "These products could have important consequences for herders' decisions regarding winter pasture quality and potential migration routes."  In addition to climate change, reindeer herders also have to face a loss of pastures because of infrastructure development, such as roads, hydroelectric power dams and cabin resorts.  The same technology would help the ICR to monitor the different forms of land-use change over time.

As the United States shutters some diplomatic sites around the globe over concerns about a possible attack, at least two major U.S. cities have stepped up their security.  In New York, officials are beefing up police presence, particularly around transportation hubs and religious sites, New York Police Department spokesman James Duffy told CNN.  And in San Francisco, police increased patrols at key locations, including mass transit, popular landmarks and embassies, said spokesman Gordon Shyy.  Officials in both cities emphasized that there was no specific threat leading to the decision. Rather, the moves were made in an abundance of caution.  In Washington, the Metro Transit Police Department sent an e-mail to employees Friday night.  "I want to let you know that at this time, there is no specific or credible threat against Metro, nor any other transportation system in the U.S. However, this worldwide alert serves as an important reminder for us to remain vigilant at all times," police Chief Ron Pavlik wrote.  U.S. Park Police spokesman Paul Brooks said security has not been increased at national monuments in Washington, and there are no new directives to officers.  In Los Angeles, police and the county sheriff's department said they had no new formal directives, but were told to be a little more vigilant than usual.  Miami police told CNN it was "business as usual," and that the department is constantly monitoring for potential threats.  Houston police said they do not comment on "tactical operations."  CNN's Josh Levs, Chuck Johnston, Greg Seaby, Chris Boyette, Devon Sayers, Marlena Baldacci and Stella Chan contributed to this report.  
 Idiotic TV shows and all the latest apps bumming you out on the 21st century? Ready for some "me time" on the world's remotest islands?  Forget golden sands and swaying palmsthe reality of solitude is different as these terrifyingly distant landfalls demonstrate.  Tristan da Cunha1,750 miles from South Africa  The British island group of Tristan da Cunha stands profoundly alone in the South Atlantic. The nearest landfall is South Africa, 1,750 miles east, and to the west, South America is more than 2,000 miles.  It's the world's most remote inhabited island chainso precariously occupied that when a volcanic vent erupted in 1961, the whole population was evacuated to England.  Reaching Tristan da Cunha: This is no easygoing excursion.  To quote the official website, "There are no package tours for independent travelers, no hotels, no airport, no holiday reps, no night clubs, no restaurants, no jet skis nor safe sea swimming."  All visitors need to clear their arrivals in advance through the Island Council, and they also need to obtain a police certificate. (A 40-day wait is typical.)  There are around 10 sailings a year from Cape Town, South Africa, and Namibia, each taking five to six days to reach the islands; it costs $800-$1,500 for a round trip. A list of available ships can be found on the official website: www.tristandc.com.  Bear Island400 miles off Europe's north coast  Bjornoya, better known as Bear Island, is the southernmost island in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, 400 miles north of mainland Europebut only on paper, given that it's almost 150 miles south of the Norwegian island chain with which it's lumped.  It's been a nature reserve since 2002 and has a lively history of failed occupationhard to believe for a place of barren cliffs, near-zero precipitation and risk of leaks of radioactive material from the nearby wreck of a nuclear submarine.  Reaching Bear Island: Getting to the heart of Svalbard is a relatively simple matterthere are daily flights from Oslo and Tromso to Svalbard's capital, Longyearbyen, on the west coast of Spitsbergen.  Now it gets tricky. Research vessels infrequently call on Bear Island (the Norwegian Polar Institute makes an occasional appearance), while individually chartered boats and the occasional adventure cruise (such as this one from Polar Quest) haul in the remaining visitors.  Bouvet1,000 miles from Antarctica  Tristan da Cunha is the remotest inhabited island in the worldnow, welcome to its uninhabited, far bleaker counterpart.  Its cliffs are sheer. It's almost entirely covered by a glacier. In winter, its seas are pack ice.  And its nearest neighbor is Antarctica, 1,000 miles to the south. In short, idyllic.  Reaching Bouvet: The entire island is a nature reserveso unless you can make a compelling case for visiting, you'll be blocked by Norwegian authorities.  Get permission, and it's now a simple matter of finding a research vessel, quickly mastering a valuable skill such as arctic geological surveying or marine biology and then getting someone to land you via helicopter. (There are no ports or harbors.)  If all else fails, try becoming an amateur radio enthusiast: In 1990, a multinational expedition of operators spent 16 days on the island.  Bishop Rock30 miles from England  Regarded by Guinness as the world's smallest island with a building on it, Bishop Rock stands at the end of Britain's Isles of Scilly, where coastal waters give way to the fury of the Atlantic.  In 1847, engineers started building an iron lighthouse thereand it washed away in a storm. Its extraordinary successor, first lit in 1858, stands to this day.  Reaching Bishop Rock: Visiting the most southwesterly point in Britain is surprisingly easythe St. Mary's Boatsmen's Association runs day trips.  But as Martin Hesp notes, even on a "calm" day you're in for serious chop.  Boreray60 miles off mainland Scotland  Love the Scottish islands, but want something with a little more bite? Head west of the Outer Hebrides, and you'll find the archipelago of St. Kilda, 40 miles into the Atlantic.  It's one of Scotland's five World Heritage sites, with a main island that was abandoned in the 1930s when crops failed. Imagine the surprise of archaeologists when they found that one of the least hospitable islands, Boreray, was occupied in prehistoric times.  Reaching Boreray: Since Boreray comes under the protection of the National Trust for Scotland, you need its permission to visit.  Then? Lots of time and lots of luckwith a rugged shoreline and savage sea swell, this isn't an island built for landings.  According to one guide, more people have reached the summit of Everest than have landed at Boreray since the National Trust took ownership in 1957.  North Sentinel Island  400 miles from Myanmar  North Sentinel is one of the 572 islands making up the Andaman chain in the Indian Ocean's Bay of Bengal.  It's surrounded by dangerous reefs, but North Sentinel is intimidating because of its inhabitants. The Sentinelese want nothing to do with the modern world and have repeatedly rebuffed attempts to make peaceful contact.  Reaching North Sentinel Island: You're kidding, right? If the above description didn't put you off, this article about a pair of fishermen who strayed onto the island certainly should.  Rockall270 miles from Ireland  If you think Boreray sounds forbidding, try sailing 187 miles west of it. Rockall is the tip of an extinct volcano reaching 20 meters (about 65 feet) above sea level, in seas with waves recorded as high as 29 meters (95 feet).  In 1955, the British Empire, in its final territorial acquisition, seized Rockallallegedly due to fears the Soviets would build a missile battery on it.  Reaching Rockall: In the words of the recently minted Rockall Club, "visiting Rockall is difficult, completely weather dependent and not cheap."  Your best bet is contacting Kilda Cruises and arranging a tailor-made excursion. Or you could sail there, lash yourself to the rock and claim it as your very own micronationbut you wouldn't be the first.

A French author whose tales center on memory and guilt has won this year's Nobel Prize in literature, the Nobel committee in Sweden said Thursday.  Patrick Modiano, 69, is the 11th Nobel literature prize winner born in France.  He is being honored "for the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable human destinies and uncovered the life-world of the occupation," the committee said.  Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said Modiano was "well known in France, but pretty well not anywhere else."  Born in 1945, Modiano has published some 30 books, mainly novelsfor which he is chiefly knownbut also some children's books and movie scripts.  His novels tend to be short, often 130 to 150 pages in length, and written in simple language, Englund said, but they are refined and elegant in nature.  "They are always versions of the same themeabout memory, about loss, about identity, about seeking," he said.  Modiano, who published his first novel in 1968, has previously been recognized with some of the most prestigious prizes in French literature, including the Prix Goncourt in 1978.  Englund's own recommendation? The novel "Missing Person," which plays with the detective genre as its protagonist, who has lost his memory, seeks to find out who he really is.  The Swedish committee has not yet been able to reach Modiano to tell him of his win, he added.  Troubled past  In a 2011 interview with the cultural journal France Today, Modiano said of writing, "Actually, I never thought of doing anything else."  The child of a Belgian mother and an Italian Jewish father, his was a difficult, fragmented childhood, the journal says. His experiences are recounted in his memoir, "Un Pedigree," published in 2005.  His works are infused with questions of identity, often tied in with France's troubled past during the Nazi Occupation.  "After each novel, I have the impression that I have cleared it all away," he told France Today. "But I know I'll come back over and over again to tiny details, little things that are part of what I am. In the end, we are all determined by the place and the time in which we were born."  Sticking with familiar themes, he also made the 1974 movie "Lacombe, Lucien" with director Louis Malle, which was set during the Occupation.  His latest work is the novel "Pour que tu ne te perdes pas dans le quartier," published this month.  The Nobel Prize in literature has been awarded 107 times since 1901. It is almost always awarded to one author and has been shared only four times, which stands in contrast to the science Nobels, which two or three scientists often share.  The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday, followed by the award for achievements in economics Monday.

Germany's government has asked America's top spy chief stationed in the country to leave.  It's a punitive gesture usually reserved for adversarial nations in times of crisis and only very rarely for an ally, particularly a very close one.  But allegations of American spying have seriously injured German trust, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said. And it's time for a reset.  Germany let loose the diplomatic slap, reminiscent of a Cold War rebuke, after news of two new possible U.S. espionage cases broke back to back in a week's time.  Two Germansone working at a German intelligence agency, the other in the Ministry of Defenseare suspected of spying for the United States.  Local media report that both cases involve stolen official German documents.  The U.S. official shown the door is based in Berlin at the U.S. Embassy, which followed up on Friday's announcement with a note to journalists:  "The U.S. Embassy has seen the reports that Germany has asked the U.S. Mission Germany's intelligence chief to leave the country. As a standard practice, we will not comment on intelligence matters."  A German official confirmed that person was the CIA's station chief and that the agency's director, John Brennan, has talked multiple times with his German counterpart.  'So much stupidity'  Top German government officials have candidly spoken about the decision to expel the U.S. official as they poured their disappointment over alleged U.S. spying into microphones and cameras for days.  Most pointedly, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble casually described the alleged U.S. actions as "daft" before a television talk show audience. "One can only cry over so much stupidity," he said.  He based his remarks on the essential value of Germany's cooperation with U.S. intelligence agencies to fight international terrorism and complained that spying spoils the relationship.  Legal action  The latest allegations weigh densely on ties already burdened since Edward Snowden leaked indications that the National Security Agency tapped into Merkel's own cell phone.  They have seemingly undone any of Washington's diplomatic smoothing over previously alleged NSA intrusions.  One of the new cases has landed on top of an existing investigation on federal prosecutors' desks into the possible spying on Merkel.  The NSA scandal has also prompted prosecutors to set up a new special committee to investigate and criminally prosecute cyberspying by foreign intelligence.  Merkel deferred to the pending results of those investigations, but it didn't stop her from expressing on Thursday the disappointment she feels over the suspected acts.  "From a common sense standpoint, in my opinion, spying on allies is, in the end, a waste of energy. We have so many problems, and we should, I find, concentrate on the essentials."  ISIS, Syria, terrorismall take priority over spying on each other, she said. And trust between allies is vital.  Privacy is sacred  To understand Germany's particular hurt over spying allegations, one need only to look at the country's history in the 20th century, when oppressive fascist and communist regimes spied on citizens in order to persecute them.  During the Cold War, high-level spy scandals stoked division between then divided democratic West Germany and communist East Germany.  The scandals triggered government shakedowns and deep public outrage in the West.  As a result of the Nazi past, democratic, postwar Germany has instituted very strict privacy laws that prohibit government agencies, companies and private individuals from gathering or passing even simple information about citizens without their express consent. Or in criminal cases, without probable cause.  Data protection is so sacred in Germany that advertisers there are prevented from profiling prospective consumers.  Top U.S., German diplomats to meet  Amid the new allegations, the top U.S. and German diplomats are expected to meet in Vienna, Austria, this weekend during multination negotiations about the future of Iran's nuclear program, a senior U.S. State Department official said.  While the official said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier will touch on topics such as the Middle East and Ukraine, it'd be hard to imagine the two ignoring the spy issue.  Across the Atlantic in Washington, the new allegations have also raised the eyebrows of some elected officials.  "I am concerned that we are sending the wrong message to a key ally," said Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado.  Otherwise, administration officials have countered their German counterparts' candor with lips as sealed as those at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to comment on the reported intelligence activity as a matter of policy, to protect American national security and "intelligence assets."  "I'm not going to have anything more to add on that front," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told a journalist who asked if reports of Germany booting the U.S. intelligence official were true.  German journalists who contacted Washington officials for comment on the cases, when news of them first broke, reported receiving e-mail replies containing only two words, which they included in their articles in the original English:  "No comment."

 While suspended star striker Wayne Rooney was recovering from a hair transplant, England's hopes of automatic qualification for Euro 2012 suffered a blow on Saturday as Switzerland claimed at 2-2 draw at London's Wembley Stadium.  The balding Manchester United player, who was booked in March's win over Wales to trigger the ban, revealed on Twitter before kickoff that he had used his time off to visit a hair specialist.  "Just to confirm to all my followers I have had a hair transplant. I was going bald at 25, why not. I'm delighted with the result," he wrote on the social networking website.  "It's still a bit bruised and swollen when it dies down u will be first to see it. Anyone recommend any good hair gel. Haha."  France held by Belarus in Euro 2012 qualifier  It was more serious for Fabio Capello's team, who had to come from two goals down after goalkeeper Joe Hart was badly caught out by two free-kicks from Tranquillo Barnetta just after half an hour.  Frank Lampard reduced the deficit with a penalty before halftime and his replacement Ashley Young leveled soon after coming on at the interval.  The result meant Montenegro joined England on 11 points at the top of Group G after five games after also being held at home, 1-1 by Bulgaria.  Bulgaria and the Swiss have little chance of earning second place and a berth in the playoffs, with both nations having five points with three matches left.  England next travel to Bulgaria on September 2, when Montenegro visit pointless bottom nation Wales.  Hart looked on in bemusement as Barnetta's curling set-piece drifted past his defenders and into the far corner in the 32nd minute, and he was caught out at the near post by the same player from wide out on the left soon after.  However, Lampard made it 2-1 in the 36th minute when Jack Wilshere was fouled in the box by his Arsenal teammate Johan Djourou, and Young leveled six minutes after his halftime introduction after being set up by fellow substitute Leighton Baines.  Striker Darren Bent blazed over the bar when he should have hit the target for England with 20 minutes left, and both teams went close in the closing stages.  England manager Capello said his players were tired after a long season.  "You can see the Switzerland players were fresher. They have had a different season," the Italian said.  "We had three clear chances to score goals but at the end of the game, in the last 10 minutes, some players were without energy."  Slovakia, Russia and the Republic of Ireland are tied on 13 points at the top of Group B after all three won on Saturday.  Slovakia edged a 1-0 win at home to bottom nation as striker Robert Vittek scored the only goal in the 63rd minute.  Russia triumphed 3-1 at home to Armenia thanks to a hat-trick from striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, while the Irish defeated Macedonia 2-0 away as skipper Robbie Keane netted both goals to pass a half-century in internationals.  Greece returned to the top of Group F with a 3-1 victory over Malta, with two goals from young attacking talent Giannis Fetfatzidis and another by teenage debutant Kyriakos Papadopoulos.  That moved the Greeks a point above Croatia, who were joined on 12 by Israel following that nation's 2-1 win in Latvia.  Midfielder Yossi Benayoun and Tal Ben Haim, with a penalty, scored in the first half to keep Israel's qualification bid alive.  Group H also has a three-way tie at the top with Portugal, Denmark and Norway battling for automatic qualification.  Portugal beat Norway 1-0 at home as striker Helder Postiga scored the only goal eight minutes after halftime.  Denmark joined them on 10 points, winning 2-0 in Iceland thanks to second-half goals from Lasse Schone and Christian Eriksen.  In a friendly international, five-time World Cup winners Brazil drew 0-0 with three-time runners-up the Netherlands.  The home team had midfielder Ramires sent off in the 79th minute for his second booking.  Current world champions Spain crushed the United States 4-0 in Massacheusetts as Santi Cazorla scored twice, with the other goals coming from fellow striker Alvaro Negredo and his halftime replacement Fernando Torres.  The U.S. upset Spain in the semifinals 2009 Confederations Cup, but this time conceded three goals in 13 minutes from just before the half-hour mark.  Spain visited in a warm-up match for the Americans ahead of the CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament which the U.S. is hosting this month.

MEXICO CITY, Mexico One small slice Monday of Mexican President Felipe Calderon's war on drug cartels: two shootouts on the streets of two cities; a man and a woman ambushed in their car; at least four people dead; three soldiers wounded, one of them gravely.  Suspected members of Los Zetas drug cartel are presented to reporters in Mexico City in April.  The confrontations between unidentified gunmen and Mexican army and federal police took place in the communities of San Nicolas de los Garza and Escobedo, near the U.S. border in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, the state-run Notimex news agency said.  One of the firefights lasted 45 minutes. At one point, the suspects launched hand grenades at the soldiers. House-to-house searches took two hours and it would be another seven hours before the areas were secured.  According to Notimex and news reports from the newspapers Excelsior, El Porvenir, El Nuevo Leon and El Norte, here's what happened:  Around 6 a.m., a military convoy came across a group armed men in several late-model vehicles in San Nicolas de los Garza. Shooting broke out, and the gunplay continued for 45 minutes along several neighboring streets as the suspects tried to get away.  The armed men abandoned their cars, blocked one of the streets with a Suburban truck and fled aboard several other vehicles.  The confrontation continued for another two hours as soldiers sealed off a city block and searched house-to-house.  "From early on, we could hear the shots and much shouting," Excelsior and El Nuevo Leon quoted an unidentified woman as saying. "We could hear footsteps on the roofs and soldiers yelling to them. There were several explosions; it seems like grenades went off, because we could hear it very loudly twice."  Around 7:45 a.m., the soldiers entered a house where the gunmen had holed up. A grenade went off upstairs. Three gunmen died there, though officials did not say if it was from bullet wounds or the grenade explosion.  At the same time, Mexican military and federal police were involved in a shootout with armed men in Escobedo. That confrontation left three soldiers wounded, with one of them clinging to life Monday afternoon.  Also nearby, a man and a woman riding in car were ambushed at an intersection by armed men in several cars who surrounded them and drilled their auto with bullets.  The woman died on the scene, her body sprawled on the street. The man was wounded but survived.  The violent scene in Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas, has become a near-daily experience in Mexico since Calderon took office in December 2006 and launched a war on drug cartels. More than 11,000 people have been killed during that timeabout 1,000 of them police and other authorities.  
 Fort Hood, Texas The military judge overseeing the trial of admitted Fort Hood gunman Maj. Nidal Hasan told defense attorneys Thursday that they can't drop out of the caseeven though they believe it's tantamount to helping him commit suicide.  "This is nothing more than their disagreement with Major Hasan's strategy in conducting his defense," said the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, rejecting a motion by the standby counsel who are tasked with assisting Hasan as he represents himself.  The attorneys argued Wednesday that Hasan is trying to help the prosecution achieve a death sentence.  Osborn's decision sparked a bitter fight in a trial focused on charges that Hasan shot and killed 13 people and wounded 32 in the November 2009 rampage at the Army installation near Killeen, Texas.  "We believe your order is causing us to violate our professional ethics. It's morally repugnant to us as defense counsel," said Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, head of Hasan's legal team.  He asked for a stay on her order, which would prevent it from going into effect. The judge then asked for a written document from the state bar establishing that continuing to work with Hasan would be an ethical violation.  "I will make it easy for you. I've given you an order ... and that relieves you of every ethical liability," Osborn said.  Poppe would have nothing of it, his voice raised in obvious frustration.  "The order does not relieve us of the responsibility. ... We believe we are doing something that is morally repugnant. This is not about saving my license ... this is about what you are requiring me to do today: assist this man in achieving the goal, which we believe is achieving a death sentence."  The lead prosecutor chimed in, questioning the defense team's claims, saying that Hasan is mounting a legitimate defense.  "The government sees only two defenses: either 'I didn't do it,' or 'I did it, with an excuse.' He was caught with a gun in his hand," said Col. Michael Mulligan.  "I don't understand how that's repugnant to defense counselI'm truly perplexed."  In a military capital trial, a guilty plea is not an option. Hasan's official plea is that he is not guilty of the charges. But on Tuesday, Hasan used his opening statement to declare "I am the shooter."  After the standby counsel argued Wednesday that Hasan was seeking the death penalty, Hasan objected, calling it "a twist of the facts." But he refused to submit his objection in writing, a move that Osborn requested to avoid revealing privileged information in open court.  The defense attorneys Thursday immediately appealed Osborn's ruling. But she gave no stay in the meantime. "We're going to move forward," the judge said, allowing the trial to continue unless a higher military court weighs in.  The trial resumed with the prosecution calling to the stand soldiers who were witnesses of Hasan's shooting spree.  The attorneys' request Wednesday halted what would have been the second day of testimony.  Although Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, was granted his request to represent himself, Osborn ruled before the court-martial began that defense lawyers would act as standby counsel during the proceedings.  Expert: Judge can't let attorneys stop  Geoffrey Corn, a military justice expert at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said the defense lawyers are in "a terrible predicament."  "They have to stand by and watch the person they are ostensibly charged with assisting to represent himself essentially put a noose around his own neck, and they view this as fundamentally inconsistent with their ethical obligation as lawyers," he said.  But Corn said Hasan not only has the right to defend himself, "he has the right to do it poorly"even to the point of asking for death.  "The defense lawyers would love to get off this case, because it becomes unbearable," Corn said. "If you imagine having to sit there, being an ardent opponent of capital punishment, watching this guy seal his own fate with every move he makes, it must be torture. But the judge can't let them off the case."  Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions  Witnesses describe horror of shooting  Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage. He listened impassively as one of the first witnesses recounted the horror unleashed that November day at a processing center for soldiers heading to Afghanistan and Iraq.  Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford stared hard at Hasan, appearing to brace for a cross-examination from the man who had admitted to shooting him seven times. But Hasan just stared back.  The courtroom turned silent as Lunsford was called as a witness. He was the first of several survivors scheduled to testify against Hasan.  Lunsford recounted how the gunman rose from a chair in the processing center, shouted "Allahu Akbar," pulled out a pistol and began shooting.  "It was a state of panic," Lunsford said.  Lunsford, a health care specialist, described how his friend and colleague, physician's assistant Michael Cahill, tried to hit Hasan with a chair to stop the shooting; Hasan shot him dead. Soldiers tried to flee or take cover inside the processing center as Hasan fired dozens of shots.  As Lunsford was checking behind him, "Major Hasan is turning the weapon on me," he said. "He has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and I blink. In that time, he discharges his weapon. The first round, I'm hit in the head."  A second shot caught Lunsford in the back. He decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door. He made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside, he testified.  Hasan continued shooting at Lunsford even as he was receiving first aid outside the processing center, before police arrived. Officers shot and wounded Hasan, ending the rampage and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down.  After the prosecution finished questioning Lunsford, the judge asked Hasan whether he had any questions for the witness.  "I have no questions," Hasan said.  Hasan also declined to question Michelle Harper, who worked at the deployment center and was inside when the shooting began. Prosecutors played a recording of her 911 call, where she pleaded for help.  Scheduled to go to Afghanistan  Hasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings. Prosecutors hope to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a "progressive radicalization," giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime.  Hasan did not want to deploy to fight against other Muslims and believed "that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible," said Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in the case.  Investigators found 146 spent shell casings in the room where the attack began, Mulligan said. Hasan carried two laser-sighted pistols and 420 rounds of ammunition, his pockets lined with paper towels to muffle the sounds of the magazines banging together, he said.  Internet searches on Hasan's computer used keywords like "terrorist killing," "innocent," "Quran," "fatwas" and "suicide bombings," Mulligan said.  Hasan told the panel in his opening statement, "We mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion." But, he added, "I apologize for the mistakes I made in this endeavor."  The mujahedeen consider themselves warriors who defend the Islamic faith.  Witness: 'His punishment will come'  Hasan told his family he had been taunted after the al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011.  The case was first set to begin in March 2012, but was delayed repeatedly, notably over a previous judge's unsuccessful demand that the beard Hasan has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved.  Josh Rubin reported from Fort Hood. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Jason Morris contributed to this report.  
	 "NEW: Defense lawyers can't drop out of the case, judge says. NEW: Defense"
It's always been a mystery to me why Republican lawmakers who denounce the evils of government choose to run for office. If your belief is that the private sector holds the answers to all that ails us, it seems like you would want to go out and prove the case. So the May 9 vote by the House GOP to eliminate the American Community Survey, which collects statistics about the nation's population, is confusing.  Doing away with the data collection would seem to commit two cardinal sins against the right's ideology: Make government less efficient and eliminate a critical tool for profit-driven business.  You may not know the American Community Survey as separate from the U.S. census. While the census takes place once every 10 years, the ACS is an ongoing data collection survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau to provide more in-depth and current statistics about demographic patterns in America.  This information is crucial if you care about smart direction of the $400 billion in annual state and federal grants to schools, hospitals, infrastructure projects and other critical services.  The data derived from the survey provides guidance about how to divvy up best those hard-earned taxpayer dollars so that they are spent with as much care and precision as possible.  Apparently, that dynamic is lost on U.S. Rep. Daniel Webster, a Republican who beat Alan Grayson to win Florida's 8th Congressional District in 2010. He introduced the amendment to repeal the survey as a way to make good on his campaign promise to "stop wasteful spending." With the affirmative House vote, he hopes to save $2.5 billion over the next decade. Here's the rub though. If Webster gets his way, Americans will spend $4 trillion in that same time period with no data to guide the fundsessentially shooting in the dark with a massive amount of money.  That's the antithesis of efficiency; vastly more than $2.4 billion is likely to be wasted in the process. It seems that along with climate change and evolution, statistical science now appears to be viewed with suspicion by the tea party. I've not heard an alternative: perhaps a dartboard with pictures of all the states on it?  The GOP claims the survey is intrusive. But I have to wonder if the vote to repeal the survey is just a step toward tea party Republicans' Holy Grail of eliminating government spending entirely and with it, the $400 billion in annual disbursements.  If that is the path forward, let's look at where that road functionally leads us: Without the American Community Survey, we won't know where veterans are living, so we can't get them the financial assistance they're owed for their service to our country. Without the federal and state grants, we simply can't take care of them at all once they come home.  Without the survey, we can't know where there are pockets of uninsured people, so health care funds can be directed toward offsetting the costs of emergency room visits.  Without the state and federal grants, doctors will be forced either to let people suffer and die or raise costs on all their patients to make good on their Hippocratic oath.  Without the survey, we won't know where Americans still lack flush toilets and therefore risk contaminating the groundwater we all drink. Without the federal and state grants, we can't mitigate the impact of raw sewage on our water supply and prevent disease from spreading when our water gets tainted.  Webster might say: "Let the private sector take care of it." On that point, we can agree: The private sector can and should play a larger role maintaining the health of our country. The flaw in that plan is that our business sector is very reliant on the American Community Survey in making decisions about how best to serve their customers. That's why trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Homebuilders have voiced their opposition to the Webster amendment.  The data provided from the survey has informed everything from where to locate new stores to what kinds of products are popular with consumers.  These trade groups are hardly a bastion for government expansionists, and their opposition to this bill reveals the critical wedge in the Republican coalition. The business-first wing of the party is all too happy to allow government to foot the billin this case, for solid market researchwhen it's convenient for them. The small-government ideologues are more than happy to dismantle government piece by piece even when it harms business and creates bad spending strategies.  When asked about the elimination of the survey, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber said, "If you're opposed to the survey, you're opposed to understanding what's going on in America." For this reason, it will be an uphill climb to get the measure to pass the Senate and get signed by the president. Still, the initiative and the vote are telling.  If knowledge is power and ignorance is bliss, eliminating the American Community Survey will only pay dividends for those who live in powerful bliss. The rest of us would have to suffer through the mess being made of the informed and democratic process.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ilyse Hogue.  
 Tally-ho, Marlboro Man.  Best known as the rugged cowboy who starred in the Marlboro Man cigarette advertisements, Darrell Winfield died Monday at home in Wyoming at age 85.  His cause of death was not listed in his obituary on a Fremont County, Wyoming, news website.  Often called the most successful tobacco advertising campaign ever, the Marlboro Man appealed to American men because of his masculinity, individuality and freedom.  Though some of the Marlboro Men in the famous cigarette advertisements launched in the 1950s were actors, Winfield was the real thing.  Winfield was working at a Wyoming ranch in 1968 when Leo Burnett/Philip Morris Advertising came looking for real cowboys to feature in the campaign, according to his local obituary.  He often wore his own clothes and provided many of the animals in the photo shoots.  "His family said he loved horses, rodeo, especially team roping, ranching, and the cowboy way of life," according to his obituary. "He liked to tease, was quite a character, and never met a stranger. He collected bits and spurs, loved to read western non-fiction, history, and stories of the Native Americans."  Other Marlboro Men became disillusioned with the campaign, eventually starring in anti-smoking campaigns.  At least four actors who played the iconic cowboy died of smoking-related illnesses, the Los Angeles Times reported.  The Marlboro Man's run ended when the tobacco companies and state attorneys general reached a settlement in 1998 that banned the use of humans and cartoons in U.S. tobacco advertising.  Yet Winfield stayed true to the brand from the time he was hired in 1968 until he died, according to his obituary.  He is survived by his wife, Lennie, their six children, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.  People we lost in 2015

Federal jurors convicted the son of former Liberian president Charles Taylor Sr. of torture and conspiracy charges Thursday, said a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in the southern district of Florida.  Charles "Chuckie" Taylor Jr., also known as Charles McArthur Emmanuel, was found guilty on one count of torture, one count of conspiracy to commit torture and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, said Alicia Valle, special counsel to the U.S. attorney.  Taylor's case, tried in Miami, Florida,  was the first brought under a 1994 United States law saying those accused of committing torturous acts overseas can be tried in a U.S. federal court.  "Today's conviction provides a measure of justice to those who were victimized by the reprehensible acts of Charles Taylor Jr. and his associates," Attorney General Michael Mukasey said in a written statement.  "It sends a powerful message to human rights violators around the world that, when we can, we will hold them fully accountable for their crimes."  He could face a sentence of life in prison when he is sentenced January 8.  Although Taylor was born in Boston, Massachusetts, he moved to Liberia when his father was named president.  Prosecutors said Taylor became the leader of the Anti-Terrorist Unit and the Liberian National Police while his father was president. The two groups are accused of abducting, torturing and killing people.  According to prosecutors, Taylor committed torture and allowed others to commit torture. They burned certain victims with molten plastic, lighted cigarettes, candle wax and an iron; severely beat victims with firearms and cut and stabbed victims; and shocked certain victims with an electric device, prosecutors said in an indictment that superceded the initial indictment from 2006.  In the initial indictment, Taylor was charged with one count of torture, one count of conspiracy to torture and one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.  The superceding September 2007 indictmentwhich incorporated the initial chargesincluded five counts of torture, one count of conspiracy to torture, one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and one count of conspiracy to use a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.  The defense had said the U.S. government had little or no evidence to back up its claims.  Charles Taylor Sr. is standing trial in The Hague, Netherlands, on war crimes charges.  He was sentenced to 11 months in prison but was ordered detained on the torture charges and not released when that sentence expired, the U.S. attorney's office said.  
 In two operations in Africa nearly 3,000 miles apart, U.S. military forces went after two high-value targets over the weekend.  One operation took place early Saturday in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, when members of the elite U.S. Army Delta Force captured Abu Anas al Libi, an al Qaeda operative wanted for his alleged role in the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa.  In the second raid, a team of U.S. Navy SEALs in southern Somalia targeted a foreign fighter commander for Al-Shabaab, a terrorist group linked with al Qaeda, according to a senior Obama administration official.  Early-morning capture  Al Libi, 49, was returning to his house after morning prayers around 6:30 a.m. (Friday night ET) when a group of at least 10 men in four vehicles surprised him, his wife told CNN.  Umm Abdul Rahman said some of the men were wearing masks and some weren't. She said the unmasked men looked like Libyans to her and spoke Arabic with Libyan accents. She couldn't say whether the other men were Americans.  The capture was over very quickly, she said.  She disputed reports that her husband of 22 years was reaching for a gun when he was taken. She said he broke with al Qaeda in 1996 and had no role in the embassy bombings two years later, and he had even tried recently to clear his name.  The Saturday operation was conducted with the knowledge of the Libyan government, said one U.S. official. The Pentagon said the U.S. military was holding al Libi in a "secure location" outside Libya.  He eventually will be taken to New York, a source with knowledge of the capture and proceedings told CNN.  The Libyan interim government called the U.S. capture a kidnapping and has requested an explanation from Washington about the raid, the country's state news agency reported Sunday. Libya emphasized its citizens should be tried in Libya if they are facing charges, LANA reported.  President Barack Obama approved the two raids, monitored them closely and was updated regularly by homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco and his national security staff, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden told CNN on Sunday.  "This operation should be a clear reminder that the United States will seek justice against those who would attack Americans, and never forgets those who are victims of terrorism," the White House said Sunday.  And in a written statement Sunday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the raids "send a strong message to the world that the United States will spare no effort to hold terrorists accountable, no matter where they hide or how long they evade justice."  "We will continue to maintain relentless pressure on terrorist groups that threaten our people or our interests, and we will conduct direct action against them, if necessary, that is consistent with our laws and our values," Hagel said.  SEAL Team Six involved in Somalia  In the Somalia raid, members of the U.S. Navy's SEAL Team Six targeted a foreign fighter commander for Al-Shabaab named Ikrima, a senior Obama administration official said Sunday.  A Kenyan of Somali origin, Ikrima is associated with now-deceased al Qaeda operatives Harun Fazul and Saleh Nabhan, who played roles in the 1998 embassy bombing in Nairobi and the 2002 attacks on a hotel and airline in Mombasa, all in Kenya, the official said. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for all three.  The Nairobi embassy attack claimed 213 lives and wounded 4,500 people.  In the 2002 attacks, three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside the Israeli-owned Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, killing the bombers as well as 12 Kenyans and three Israelis. The same morning, a missile attack unsuccessfully targeted an Israeli airliner taking off from Mombasa's airport.  Local residents said the compound targeted by the Americans was the home of Al-Shabaab leader Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, also known as Ahmed Abdi Godane, and an Al-Shabaab spokesman claimed Godane was the target of the attack.  SEAL Team Six is the same unit that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011.  The SEALs came under fire and withdrew before they could confirm whether they killed their target, a senior U.S. official said. A second administration official said the commandos withdrew to avoid civilian casualties.  The operations were carried out even as polls show Americans are skittish about U.S. military involvement in overseas conflicts. This means others who might be in U.S. crosshairs could have more reason to worry, said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst.  "One (mission) could have gone without the other," Francona said. "But the fact that they did them both, I think, is a real signal that the United Statesno matter how long it takeswill go after these targets."  Speaking to reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bali, Indonesia, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the raids ought to make clear that the United States "will never stop in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror."  "Those members of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations literally can run," he said, "but they can't hide."  Al Libi tied to U.S. embassy bombings  Al Libi, has been on the radar for years. He was on the FBI's "Most Wanted Terrorists" list, with a $5 million reward offered for information leading to his arrest or conviction.  He is alleged to have played a key role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. More than 200 people were killed and another 5,000 wounded in the Kenya attack; 11 died in the Tanzania incident.  Al Libi has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, murder, destruction of American buildings and government property, and destruction of national defense utilities of the United States.  As early as December 2010, Libyan authorities told a United Nations committee that al Libi was living there, even providing a Tripoli address for him.  U.S. officials wanted al Libi to face trial in an American court.  But, counterterrorism analysts told CNN, he may not have been apprehended at the time because of the delicate security situation in much of Libya. There, ex-jihadistsespecially those who once belonged to the Libyan Islamic Fighters Groupheld considerable sway after the ouster of longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi.  "It's a huge deal to get him," said CNN's Nic Robertson, who has long been covering al Qaeda. "He's a big player in al Qaeda (and) he is in one of the key target areas, the north of Africa."  Beyond any psychological impact on the terrorist group, al Libi's capture could potentially yield a wealth of information about al Qaeda's plans and capabilities. The terrorist network has shown particular strength of late in Africa.  "Clearly, he may have useful information about the strength of al Qaeda and the Islamists in Libya," Robertson said. "He is somebody who is senior within al Qaeda. He was well respected, a good operative."  Al-Shabaab blamed for Kenya mall attack  Al-Shabaab long has been a target of Washington as well: It was designated a foreign terrorist organization in  2008. The group is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries as well.  The attack on Nairobi's Westgate Mall on September 21 thrust Al-Shabaab into the spotlight once again. Washington vowed to support Kenya's government after the bloody raid, which killed at least 67 people.  The Navy SEAL raid on Al-Shabaab took place before dawn Saturday (late Friday night ET) in the southern Somalian port city of Barawe. Abdiaziz Abu Musab, an Al-Shabaab spokesman, said at least one Al-Shabaab fighter was killed in the gunfight.  But no U.S. personnel were injured or killed, a U.S. official said.  In recent months, Al-Shabaab's haven in south-central Somalia has been been increasingly squeezed as Kenyan forces fight the group from the south and African Union forces come down from Mogadishu, the Somali capital.  At the same time, Al-Shabaab has become even more closely aligned with al Qaeda. The two groups effectively merged last year, said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen.  "This is a group that has adopted al Qaeda's ideology wholesale," Bergen said. "The reason they attacked the mall was not only because it was Kenyan, but also because it attracted a fair number of Western businessmen and others living in Nairobi."

	 'Charles "Chuckie" Taylor Jr., also known as Charles McArthur '
Wayne Rooney scored a hat-trick as champions Manchester United retained their 100% English Premier League record this season with a remarkable 8-2 thumping of injury-hit Arsenal at Old Trafford.  United dominated the Gunners who suffered their worst ever Premier League defeat.  With Manchester City winning 5-1 at Tottenham also on Sunday, it proved a superb day for the two Manchester clubs, who are level at the top with a maximum nine points from their three games.  What now for Arsenal and Fabregas?  In contrast, north London rivals Tottenham and Arsenal are struggling at the other end of the table, with Tottenham at the bottom without a point and Arsenal fourth from bottom with just one point.  Arsenal, who sold star players Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri this month, were always struggling to cope with the home side once Danny Welbeck headed United into the lead following hesitancy in the defense.  And Arsenal then wasted a golden chance to level when captain Robin Van Persie's penalty was saved by United keeper David De Gea after Jonny Evans pulled back Theo Walcott.  United soon made them pay when Ashley Young curled home a superb second before Rooney's brilliant free-kick made it 3-0.  Walcott pulled a goal back for Arsenal just before half-time from an acute angle, but United restored their advantage with another trademark Rooney free-kick in the 64th minute.  By now, United were running riot, and Nani made it 5-1 after being left free in the penalty area to clip the ball into the net.  Substitute Park Ji-Sung added a sixth before Van Persie scored from close range to make it 6-2.  Arsenal then had defender Carl Jenkinson sent off for a second yellow cardmeaning the club have had a player dismissed in each of their first three matches. And soon after, Rooney completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after Walcott's foul on Nani.  The humiliation was completed when Young matched his first-half strike with another superb effort in injury time.  The defeat, the first time Arsenal had conceded eight goals in a league game since 1896, increased the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger, with new signings expected to arrive before the deadline for trades on Wednesday.  "Of course it hurts, it's humiliating, but you could see that we had not recovered physically in the second half from Wednesday night's win over Udinese," Wenger told the official Arsenal website.  "We were short in some areas, that is for sure. They have class and they punished us. It was 3-1 at half-time and I think that was harsh against us.  "We missed a penalty, we had a chance to get back to 3-2. We tried desperately to get back but we opened ourselves up and were punished. Their finishing was great today," added the Frenchman.  United's performance was matched by the dazzling display of big-spending rivals Manchester City, with Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko scoring four goals in their rout of Tottenham at White Hart Lane.  With Frenchman Nasri in fine form on his debut following his move from Arsenal, City were too strong for Spurs, and they went ahead in the 34th minute when Dzeko scored from Nasri's cross.  And the duo combined again seven minutes later when Dzeko scored with a clever back-header from Nasri's cross.  Dzeko completed his hat-trick early in the second half when he tapped in Yaya Toure's cutback.  The home side pulled a goal back when Younes Kaboul headed in Rafael van der Vaart's corner.  But Sergio Aguero soon restored the three-goal advantage with a brilliant drive from outside the penalty area.  And Dzeko curled home his fourth and Manchester City's fifth in injury time.  The result leaves Harry Redknapp's side without a point along with Blackburn and West Bromwich Albion, who suffered their third straight defeat 1-0 at home to Stoke Sunday.  In Sunday's other Premier League match, Newcastle beat Fulham 2-1 at home with two goals from striker Leon Best.  
 Paris A decree from the early 1990s, reimplemented by French regulators, is putting an end to French television and radio announcers naming social networking sites on air except for news purposes.  The decree banned "clandestine advertising": the promotion of a brand outside the boundaries of recognized publicity avenues.  The reimplementation of the ruling by France's Superior Audiovisual Council means that French programs will no longer be able to urge their viewers or listeners to follow them on specific sites, such as Twitter, as has become the norm in worldwide broadcasting.  The controversy began when an unnamed French TV channel approached the council to ask whether, under this decree, they had the right to direct viewers to social sites.  Christine Kelly, spokeswoman for the council explained: "Facebook and Twitter are commercial brands like Coca-Cola or L'Oreal or any other. There are many social networking sites on many topicscooking, animalswhy should we mention one and not others?"  From now on news anchors will be able to give only vague instructions as to where to find information online, such as "follow us on social networking sites."  French bloggers have been up in arms on Twitter and some have even composed tongue-in-cheek ways to get round the ban. One suggested: "find live coverage of the trial on our thread on the platform which spreads messages of 140 characters"  French commentators have been speculating on the real roots of this regulation. Matthew Fraser, a social networking expert and author of "Throwing Sheep in the Boardroom," a book looking at the online social media revolution, believes the ban could be a sign of defiance against Anglo-Saxon cultural domination.  "In my mind," he said, "if it had been a French social networking site then nobody would have wanted it to be regulated, but because these sites symbolize the United States, regulation is there."  This is not the first time anglicized, Internet-related vocabulary has been banned in France. In 2003 the use of the word "e-mail" was forbidden in all government literature. This was due to the Toubon law, which tries to protect the purity of the French language from anglicized words and phrases.  This time, however, the Superior Audiovisual Council insists that the ban is in no way linked to language purity.  "It's not at all related. It's true that we are very attached to the French language and defend it a lot, but ... this is simply about reapplying existing regulations," Kelly said.  The council's decision did not cause much of a debate in the French media. Fraser believes that unlike cheese or wine there were no French interests involved and the French are simply used to regulation. "It doesn't faze them because it's part of their culture," he said.  Kelly emphasized the cultural differences that need to be taken in to account: "We have many, many rules which do not exist elsewhere. There is a very different context for this from one country to another. In the U.S., for example there are advertisements on TV every five minutes, whereas in France its more like every 20 minutes." She added that, similarly, in the United States product placement is commonplace, but it is forbidden in France.  Many are struck by the bizarre timing of the ban as it comes on the heels of the e-G8, an internet summit in Paris at which President Nicolas Sarkozy met with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

(EW.com)Ivan Reitman has decided that he will not return to direct the next installment of "Ghostbusters," EW has confirmed.  After producing and directing the previous two films and staying with the third project for years, Reitman will produce and help Sony find a new director for the film, which is eyeing an early 2015 shoot in New York. Deadline first reported the news.  Reitman told Deadline that his decision to step down from the director's post was in part due to the death of Harold Ramis. He said: "A lot of things happened in the last few months, the most significant of which was the passing of Harold, who was a very good friend who was extraordinarily influential in my career. We did five movies together including both Ghostbusters."  EW: 'Ghostbusters' co-star Dan Aykroyd, director Ivan Reitman on Harold Ramis' death  He also confirmed that script hold ups over the years were partially due to trouble contacting Bill Murray. They eventually started over without a role for Murray, and, Reitman said, they have a draft from Etan Cohen, with some assistance from Dan Aykroyd, that they are happy with. The original cast members are incorporated in a very minor way.  See the original story at EW.com.

 It's been almost a decade since the United States accused Iran of actively working on a secret program to develop nuclear weapons. Since then, Iran has steadfastly proclaimed to a skeptical world that it only seeks to produce nuclear energy, while American presidents have repeatedly warned that the United States will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. Over the years, the international community has demanded, to no avail, that Tehran end its uranium enrichment program.  Iran's defiance, coupled with its threats to destroy Israel, have led Israel to consider the option of a pre-emptive strike.  World powers have repeated their preference for a diplomatic solution reached through "sustained dialogue" as the possibility of negotiations surfaces once again. The statement came after Iran indicated it might let U.N. inspectors visit the military facility at Parchin, from which it had recently blocked them. But negotiations have failed many times without slowing Iran's enrichment activities.  The risk is increasing as the United Nations nuclear agency chief expresses renewed concern about Iran's nuclear intentions. Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Wednesday that, "Iran has engaged in activities relevant to the development of nuclear explosive devices."  Gary Sick: Are sanctions leading to war?  Tension is high. President Obama's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week did not produce any breakthrough. No one knows how the standoff over Iran's nuclear program will unfold. But some possible scenarios have crossed people's minds.  1. Iran backs down and opens up to diplomacy.  Under the weight of sanctions and the threat of war, Iran's leaders agree to a softened version of the U.N. demands. The theocracy survives, war is avoided and the opposition remains weak under the Ayatollahs' heels, hoping to rise up another day.  2. The West attacks.  Watching the negotiations drag on and the advances made in Iran's nuclear program, Israel decides that it cannot trust President Obama to "always have Israel's back." Israeli fighter jets, flying with permission from Saudi Arabia across Saudi airspace, launch a bombing campaign against fortified Iranian nuclear targets.  Or, President Obama, who has consistently expressed his preference for diplomacy, could reach a point where he believes diplomacy has failed and force, a last resort, has to be used. The U.S. attacks Iran without U.N. support (China and Russia indignantly object) but with the backing of European allies (though not NATO because Turkey indignantly objects.) Some Arab countries quietly cheer from the sidelines hoping to see their historic Persian rival pushed back.  If either Israel or the United States attacks, Iran's nuclear installations are destroyed.  Iran fights and loses. The regime is weakened and eventually a somewhat more Western-friendly government takes power. The new government says Iran has a right to nuclear power, but decides it's a bad idea to pursue a nuclear program for the time being.  Alternatively, Iran doggedly fights back with allied militias in Lebanon and Gaza attacking Israel. The war lasts longer than anyone expected. Chaos descends on the Middle East. Israeli civilians move to underground shelters. Iran's nuclear program is set back but the regime survives, vowing revenge toward the attackers. The country remains a perpetrator and sponsor of terrorism around the world but it is no longer capable of enriching uranium.  3. Iran reaches ability to make a bomb.  Iran manages to achieve "breakout" nuclear capability, accumulating everything it needs to assemble a nuclear bomb. Israel's security concerns are heightened. Its rival neighbors in Arab countries and in Turkey rush to catch up. The chances of wars and conflicts in the Middle East increase. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and others try to acquire nuclear weapons. The world becomes a less safe place as barriers against nuclear proliferation become less effective.  Granderson: Will Iran cost Obama the presidency?  4. Iran calls the world's bluff.  The diplomatic dance of threats, sanctions and speeches goes on until one day Iran announces that the Persian Empire has been restored to its old glory. Iran has a nuclear bomb and anyone who dares challenge it will be dispatched to the afterlife. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and others feel vulnerable next to a nuclear capable Tehran. They try to build their own nuclear weapons. Emboldened by its ability, Iran's rhetoric becomes more defiant. Calls for Israel's destruction are regularly interspersed with mocking statements about Arab leaders who are friendly to the West or, worse, those who support peace with Israel. Iran's threat to "wipe Israel off the map" hangs in the air. War becomes unavoidable, but by now it's a war between nuclear-armed nations.  Undoubtedly, no one wants another war. But Iran's pursuit and acquisition of nuclear weapons could ultimately prove more catastrophic for the Middle East, the West and the entire world. The international community must find a way to end Iran's nuclear program. After 10 years of threats and warnings, Tehran may no longer believe that it has to give up its nuclear program. The only way war may be avoided is if Iran believes an attack from the West is a real possibility.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.

When Shenan Chuang started out in the advertising industry in the 1980s, Chinese adverts were often dismissed as mere propaganda, unable to compete with powerful Western agencies.  Now in 2014, the country's advertising market is the world's second largest, perhaps thanks in part  to Taiwan-born Shenan Chuang, CEO of Ogilvy and Mather Greater China.  Meeting in the luxurious Waldorf Astoria in Bejing, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout spoke to the woman leading an industry tipped to exceed $50 billion in revenues by 2015.  Kristie Lu Stout: What are some of your most creative campaigns?  SC: In 2012 we created a poster campaign for Coke, it was called "Coke Hands" and won the Grand Prix at Cannesit was recognized as a cultural icon for the people. Recently in Taiwan we did a campaign for a local bank.  The TV campaign featured a group of six senior citizens who were not in good shape, but had a dream. In honor of  their dead friends they decided to ride motorcycles around the island. The campaign was very successful on Youtube and on social media.  KLS: What's your daily work schedule like?  SC: I wake up at 5am and exercise before I do anything else, and I finish work around 9pm or 10pm. When I first started out I worked seven days a week. But that was terrible and gave me some spine problems.  In recent years I've been very disciplined. I work during the week and at the weekend I spend time with my friends.  It's important to take a break, breathe and see the world. At the beginning of your career you have to learn a lot. You have to invest yourself, and you need to work hard. You have to go the extra mile when you are in the early stages of your career.  KLS: In every career, there is always at least one colossal failure. What has been your biggest mistake?  SC: My biggest mistake was in 1995, when I was leading Ogilvy Taiwan. WPP had just bought Ogilvy and enforced a lot of financial discipline. My executive creative director decided to leave. He thought our culture had changed and there was too much focus on finance and numbers. So he left, and so did a group of senior people.  But I was able to bounce back with a new team, and it took us one and a half years to bounce back, but we worked together and gained a good creative reputation in Taiwan. I would say that was my biggest hurdle.  KLS: Who shaped you and influenced you the most growing up?  SC: My family has a lot of strong women. My aunts are very, very strong, and they take care of everyone. So I think I learned a lot from them, and then also I read a lot. In terms of advertising I would have to say David Ogilvy, our founder.  I translated one of his books, and I learned a lot about how to lead the company and the company culture. And then our current global CEO, Miles Young, the reason I name him is because I think he's probably one of very few leaders that is very business focused, but also very people oriented.  KLS: Will there ever be a Chinese female president?  SC: I think in Taiwan it's very likely.  KLS: What is your advice to young women starting out in marketing communications, PR or advertising, what do you want to tell them?  SC: I want to tell them you have to be brave. You have to stand up for yourself, you have to show that we have what it takes to be in charge.  Learn: How DVF conquered fashion world  Inspire: Sandberg: Positive images spur change  
 For centuries, the lush national parks of southern Kenya and northern Tanzania have been called home by the Maasai, one of Africa's most culturally district tribes.  Being traditional pastoralists with a nomadic bent, the Maasai have used the sprawling grasslands and forested slopes of the Serengeti National Park, Tsavo National Park and Mkomazi Game Reserve as a grazing ground for their cattle, which provide them with the milk, meat and blood they need to survive.  But lately, these rich lands have also lured many outsiders, including large-scale hunting companies, threatening the traditional Maasai way of living.  "The riches and the wealth that come out of it is actually flying away from Maasai land by the rich and powerful people," says Martin Saning'o Kariongi, with a wry smile. "Maasai land is a very rich country, or rich region, but the owners, the inhabitants, are amongst the poorest in the world. It's very sad but that's the reality."  Read this: Maasai tribe's 'last stand'  Aware of the precarious position his tribe finds itself in, Kariongi, a well-respected Maasai community leader, has made it his life's work to save his people and their way of life, whilst helping them adapt to a changing world.  As one of the few of his generation to make it through high school and further education, Kariongi started his work as a social development activist in the early 1990s, after spending time studying in Europe. Upon his return to Tanzania, he organized a legal campaign opposing a government-forced eviction of Maasai people from the country's Simanjiro plains.  The High Court of Tanzania ruled in favor of the Maasai and soon Kariongi was working to improve the economic conditions of his people too.  "Around 2000 we started to think that despite the whole struggle for land rights and human rights of the Maasai people, poverty is growing and so many of our young people are rushing into cities," recalls Kariongi. "That's when we actually said we have to find a way to create opportunities for community economic empowerment."  Read this: 'Education is the road out of poverty'  Kariongi's first idea for self-sustainability was to turn the resources available to the Maasaitheir animals and abundant milkinto an opportunity to create wealth for his people.  Working together with a SHGW, a Dutch NGO dedicated to promoting sustainable development in rural regions of the developing world, they launched a company and established five small milk processing units in five locations around the Maasai plains.  From milking the herds to processing the milk and producing the dairy products, the business is run entirely by women. The units can process up to 2,000 liters a day, making cheese, yoghurt, butter and ghee.  "We started the milk processing plant as one way of finding a ready market for the women," says Kariongi, who's based his social development plan on gender equality. "As an economic project that will create a market where women can sell milk and engage in a cash economy," he adds.  "It has been going on now for the last five years and the life of the people, the life of the families have changed dramatically and women are making so much money."  Today, the company has grown to include many arms, from an energy and water firm, to a media house producing broadcasts tailored for the Maasai, to a community ranch that helps improve access to quality breeds.  They are all growing organically, based on a strict business model.  "The social investor who is investing in us is investing as an investor, not as a donor," explains Kariongi, who is a strong opponent of handouts. "This social business mentality is actually creating opportunities to awaken our entrepreneurial nature; that we use our own locally available resources to create wealth and to create sustainability within ourselves to come out of poverty, rather than depending on aid," he says.  Read this: Good African Coffee wants trade, not aid  It's all part of Kariongi's determination to help his people adapt, intact, to the 21st century and avoid extinction.  "We have created facilities herethe radio station, the milk processing plant, the energy and water company, the internet, the libraryall these facilities to bring modern life to people, so they don't have to rush to towns," says Kariongi. "When we lost our sons and daughters, rushed into towns, our women going to towns, then our lands will become empty and we might end up in an extinction."  He adds: "Culture is not static; culture is dynamic, it grows; it's like a fireIn order for the fire to keep on burning and giving light and heat, somebody has to be putting new fire wood. And the culture is like thatso generations come and go, and each generation puts its own firewood on the fire and the fire is the culture."

Norwegian marathon runner Grete Waitz, winner of a record nine New York City marathons, has died at the age of 57 following a six-year fight with cancer.  Waitz, who had been undergoing treatment for cancer since 2005, died overnight on Tuesday in hospital in Norway's capital Oslo, according to Helle Aanesen, co-founder of Waitz's Active Against Cancer Foundation.  She won her first New York title in 1978 setting a world record time of two hours, 32 minutes and 30 seconds.  The last of her nine winsmore than any other athlete, male or female, at the eventcame in 1988, by which time she had also won the London marathon twice (1983 and 1986).  Waitz took marathon gold at the inaugural world athletics championships at Helsinki in 1983 and picked up the silver medal at the Los Angeles Olympics the following year.  International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) president Lamine Diack described Waitz as "one of the brightest flames of the modern athletics era," AFP reported.  "The dedication, perseverance and fortitude with which Grete carved out her athletics career on the track, across the country and on the road is an example to us all, as is the positive way she tackled the illness that beset her life in recent years," he said, AFP reported.  Waitz's talents extended to other distances as well. She won the world cross-country title five times and twice broke the 3,000 meter world recordin 1975 and 1976.  In her native Norway she won a total of 33 national championships across a range of distances.  Svein Arne Hansen, head of the Norwegian athletics federation called her "the greatest Norwegian athlete of all times" and "a model for women's sport," AFP reported.  
 ISIS is a cancer that must be stamped out, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry wrote Saturday in an opinion piece for The New York Times.  Kerry called the Islamist extremist group, known for beheadings, crucifixions and terror campaigns against religious and ethnic minorities, a "unifying threat to a broad array of countries" that needs to be confronted.  His article appears in the aftermath of the political uproar that engulfed the White House this week after President Barack Obama said "we don't have a strategy" on ISIS in Syria.  Obama's no 'strategy yet' comment on ISIS in Syria sparks a political uproar  The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which calls itself the Islamic State, has grabbed headlines just as certainly as it has gobbled up territory across northern Iraq over the summer.  A companion opinion piece in the Times, co-authored by Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, concurred that ISIS poses a serious threat, but argue for an immediate response with a military plan at its center.  The ISIS threat only grows over time, and Obama must act with more urgency, the senators wrote.  "Doing too little to combat ISIS has been a problem. Doing less is certainly not the answer now," they wrote.  The next move  U.S. airstrikes against ISIS fighters have slowed their advance, and the Obama administration is weighing whether to expand the assault into Syria.  But, Kerry said, any decision will require a joint effort with international partners.  "With a united response led by the United States and the broadest possible coalition of nations, the cancer of ISIS will not be allowed to spread to other countries," Kerry wrote. "The world can confront this scourge, and ultimately defeat it. ISIS is odious, but not omnipotent."  Former CIA chief: Matter of time before ISIS tries to attack West  McCain and Graham said the next move must include a squeezing of ISIS financing, and a successful and inclusive Iraqi government that is inclusive of Iraqi Sunnis, rather than pushing them toward terrorist groups.  "But ultimately, ISIS is a military force, and it must be confronted militarily," the senators wrote.  Obama has ordered airstrikes on ISIS in northern Iraq, but "they have been tactical and reactive half-measures," McCain and Graham wrote. "Continuing to confront ISIS in Iraq, but not in Syria, would be fighting with one hand tied behind our back. We need a military plan to defeat ISIS, wherever it is."  Building a coalition  The secretary of state's message echoes that of the White House, with both the President and Press Secretary Josh Earnest calling this week for an international coalition to confront the threat.  "Airstrikes alone won't defeat this enemy. A much fuller response is demanded from the world," Kerry wrote.  To build that coalition, Kerry, along with  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, will meet with European allies on the sidelines of the NATO meeting in Wales next week.  Then, it's off to the Middle East to drum up support from the region.  What can the U.S. do against ISIS in Syriaand could it work?  "Already our efforts have brought dozens of nations to this cause," Kerry argued in the Times piece. "Certainly there are different interests at play. But no decent country can support the horrors perpetrated by ISIS, and no civilized country should shirk its responsibility to help stamp out this disease."  ISIS: The first terror group to build an Islamic state?

A cold snap in Ukraine has killed 83 people, while hundreds more have sought treatment for hypothermia and frostbite, according to state media reports.  Some 536 people have been hospitalized with hypothermia, an adviser to Health Minister Volodymyr Yurchenko is quoted as saying Friday by state news agency Ukrinform.  Of those 83 have died, he told a meeting of the Emergency Situations Ministry.  Authorities have set up nearly 2,800 "heating points" to help vulnerable people across the country, according to the Emergency Situations Ministry website.  Between December 15 and 21, these relief centers have helped more than 13,500 people, it said.  Cold arctic air has blasted Ukraine for more than a week, forcing temperatures in the capital, Kiev, below the December average high of 0 degrees and low of -5 degrees Celsius, CNN forecasters say.  The mercury in Kiev hasn't risen above -8 degrees Celsius (17.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since Monday. But the chilliest period came Tuesday, when it plummeted to -17 degrees Celsius (1.4 degree Fahrenheit.)  While the forecast doesn't look much better over the next couple of days, the capital may get back to near average temperatures on December 25 and 26.  Last winter, more than 110 people died in Ukraine as a result of a bitter cold spell that lasted around a month, from January into February.  The government said then that more 90% of the deaths were alcohol-related, with some victims drinking in the mistaken belief it would help keep them warm.  CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Judson Jones contributed to this report.  
 (OPRAH.com)On my 24th birthday, my boyfriend since college proposed. While it was the happiest moment in my life so far, I was not allowed to enjoy it for very long.  Within minutes, phone calls, text messages, BBMs and emails began flooding in, asking when the wedding would be.  Immediately, the focus was turned away from our commitment to a lifetime together and toward the overwhelming and incredibly exciting process of planning the party.  When it comes to getting married, I imagine every bride finds it very easy to get caught up in the party-planning element of things. After all, this is meant to be the one day in a girl's life when she can be a total princesshere's to hoping I can avoid Bridezilla status, and that there will, in fact, be more princess days left in storeso everything must be perfect.  Whether you're planning an intimate affair for 15, or a blowout bash for 500 of your nearest and dearest, every detail deserves your utmost attention. There are plenty of would-be party planners (mothers, grandmothers, aunts, cousins, friends, sales clerks) with tips of their own to offer to make sure your wedding goes off without a hitch. But what if there is a hitch?  Anyone who has been to a wedding knows weddings with hitches are still joyous and memorable...even if the cake melts, the band doesn't show and the groom is an hour late.  After months spent deciding on a date with my groom, selecting the guest list and designing invitations, and choosing my dress, shoes, flowers and color themes, I feel I'm finally ready to start preparing emotionally for the real journeywhat awaits us after "I do."  Oprah.com: What happily married women know  While I appreciate the generous wisdom of so many women who have gone before me as they educate me in the politics of table seating, the virtues of white versus ivory, the essentiality of at least one good Bach piece in the processional, and so onwhat I am most craving as I prepare for the impending end of my singledom is some good old-fashioned life advice.  Perhaps I am impertinent. Because I have never had a problem asking difficult, embarrassing and perhaps completely inappropriate questions --don't mind me, blame the parentsI've taken to asking every woman who will lend me her ear to share her secret to a healthy and happy marriage.  I've selected my three favorite below, but I am most curious to hear from you if you have something to offer --maybe a bit of grandmother's advice passed down to you, or something you've recognized in your own relationships or marriages (even failed ones!), or something you wish someone had told you as you prepared to take that step. I'm all ears.  Secret 1: Best marriages based on good health and bad memory  This perfect kernel came from a great-aunt of mine who lives abroad. Not that it needs much explanation, but I think the concept is worth delving into.  So often, people would rather be right than happy. Think about all the petty argumentsthe ridiculous ones where you get so angry over nothing and forget what even sparked the fightthat have ruined nights together or sent you to bed angry. How many of them were worth it? How long do you hold the grudge afterwards?  Oprah.com: When you SHOULD hold a grudge  If the fight is only worth a short-lived outburst where you say things you don't mean, it probably doesn't need to happen. If it's the kind that is long, festering and sticks with you days and weeks later, then it probably needs a much more pervasive solution than a fight that simply points out the problems.  I am all about airing grievances, but it has to be solution-oriented. Holding grudges, as tempting as it is, hurts you more than anyone else by bottling up the negative energy and embittering you from the inside out.  On the flipside, recalibration and reconnection can happen in an instant. Keeping each other healthylike taking walks together, hearing each other out, supplying physical and emotional nourishment --brings you together to the exclusion of those things that can so easily drive people apart.  Think about how much easier it is to feel less overworked and less stressed when you share a home-cooked meal, or even Chinese takeout, while sitting at a table with someone you love.  Secret 2(a) --Adjust your expectation Secret 2(b)Choose your attitude  These two come from my mother and grandmother, respectively, and sum up their personalities in a nutshell. Both are firm believers in the idea that you can only control your own behavior. Trying to micromanage the universeor just other peopleis an exercise in futility and sure to irritate. When choosing your attitude, you're deciding what your outlook on life will be.  It's easier said than done, but habitually happy people are not that way because only good things happen to them. Instead, they simply decide that no matter what happens outside their control, their attitude will be a positive one. Choosing to do the best you can with what you can control, and make the best of what you cannot control, seems like good life advice all around.  Oprah.com: Elizabeth Gilbert explores marriage around the world  Adjusting your expectation has got to be the most overlooked trick in the book for securing a stable and happy relationship with friends and significant others. Mismatched expectations are so pervasively harmful because there's no way to get around them: I want something from you that you are not prepared to give either because you don't know it is what I want, or because it's not something that's in your nature to do. I get hurt repeatedly because, no matter how much I pout and sulk, you won't do what I want.  It sounds childish when it's written like that, but this is exactly what the brain goes through when you expect five phone calls a day and he only has time for one. Or when he sends you lilies instead of the expected roses. Or when he likes rationalized argument and you prefer heated spats.  Oprah.com:  5 best things to do for your relationship  The onus is on me to open the dialogue so that my expectations come to match yours. Moreover, I have to not try to change you (the theme here seems pretty obvious), because I have no real control over how you will change, if at all. A much safer bet would be to adjust what I expect, and to acknowledge that you are exactly the way you are meant to be.  Caveat: For those of you thinking this sounds like the "roll over and play dead" strategy, it is not at all. Adjusting your expectations is not about sacrificing what you feel entitled to in order to feel happy and fulfilled. Instead, it is about giving up crazy and useless effort to change someone else in favor of realizing how you can create positive change by focusing on your own behavior. If you need more clarification on this point, go straight to the source. My mom's book on precisely this topic, and many others, is called "Us: Transforming Ourselves and the Relationships That Matter Most."  Oprah.com: Top love myths --busted!  Secret 3 --Never go to sleep angry  I cannot credit any one person with this tidbit because it seems to be the most commonly held tenet of happy couples everywhere. I don't know if there's a biological reason why going to sleep angry is badother than it's actually difficult to fall asleep if one is in a rage about somethingbut it always seems like I wake up with renewed resentment. It is as though my subconscious solidified all the petty ways I knew I just had to be right and so-and-so was obviously in the wrong.  Even if you need to set an argument aside and approach it again in the morning with a clear head, reaching some stage of resolution the night before limits the amount of baggage that comes with the fight. If it lingers over long periods, chances are you're focusing more on getting a confession or proving someone wrong than you are on finding a solution.  Oprah.com: How to know it's real love  And while you're at it, everyone knows to pick battles, but I've found it even more important to pick your timing. It may seem like an opportune moment to bring up a contentious subject as your partner is sinking into his or her pillow after a long day at the office, but in all likelihood, the response will not be a desired one. Cranky people are seldom rational, and sleepy people are seldom forgiving. Bear in mind that it won't always be sunshine and rainbows, and learning to forego the blowout fights as often as can be means less time cleaning up the mess and more time enjoying the party.

 The family of stricken Formula One star Michael Schumacher "strongly believe" he will make a recovery from the life-threatening injuries he sustained in a skiing accident.  Schumacher has been in a medically-induced coma in a Grenoble hospital since December 29 and a statement on behalf of the family Thursday said he was "still in a waking up process."  It was released a day after a published report in Germany's best-selling newspaper Bildwhich claimed the seven-time world champion had contracted pneumonia.  Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm has refused to comment on what she termed "speculation" and there is no specific reference to the report in the latest update.  "Michael's family would like to again express their sincere thanks for the continuous sympathy coming from all over the world," it read.  "The good wishes they receive help the family and, we are convinced they also help Michael, who still is in a waking up process.  "As often in such situation no day is like the next. The family is thankful for one's understanding that they would not wish to disclose medical details in order to protect Michael's privacy.  "As assured from the beginning we will continue to communicate any decisive new information on Michael's health state. We are aware that the wake up phase can take a long time.  "The family continues to strongly believe in Michael's recovery and place all their trust in the doctors', nurses' and nursing auxiliaries' team.  "The important thing is not the speed of the recovery but that Michael's heal process progresses in a continuous and controlled way.  The statement if the first official information released since January 30 when it was revealed that Schumacher's sedation had been reduced in order for him to come out of a coma.  The 45-year-old German superstar suffered a severe head trauma while skiing off-piste at the French Alps resort of Meribel.  He has undergone two emergency operations to remove blood clots on his brain and reduce swelling and kept asleep to aid his recovery.  Schumacher's wife Corinna has kept a constant vigil at the hospital since the accident.  He retired for the second and final time from F1 in 2012 after a glittering career with the Benetton, Ferrari and Mercedes teams, bringing him 91 victories in grand prix racing.  Mercedes has a "Keep Fighting Michael" message on its silver livery for the upcoming F1 season which starts next month in Australia and get well messages have flooded in from all over the world.

President Obama slipped into the role of comedian-in-chief Saturday night and took jabs at journalists, lawmakers, celebrities andmost pointedlyhis own administration's botched rollout of HealthCare.gov.  Remarks that would have otherwise put him in hot water drew applause at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner from an audience comprising some of the most famous faces in politics, entertainment and sports. The dinner is known in Washington circles as "nerd prom."  "Of course, we rolled out HealthCare.gov," Obama said of his tough year in 2013. "That could have gone better."  "In 2008, my slogan was 'Yes we can.' In 2013, my slogan was control-alt-delete," Obama said.  A poster for Walt Disney's animated hit "Frozen" flashed onto the large video screens in the ballroom, to which the president quipped that the launch of the online enrollment portal of Obamacare had been turned into one of the year's biggest movies.  After tickling funny bones with 20 minutes worth of jokes, Obama returned to the troubled rollout.  Sebilius self-depricates  The president said he'd prepared a separate, short video thanking the White House Correspondents' Association for all their hard work as the organization celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2014.  When the video choked and froze, Obama called out for help. "Does anybody know how to fix this?"  Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who was bitterly criticized over the HealthCare.gov botch, rushed up to join Obama onstage.  "I got this. I see it all the time," Sebelius said, as she appeared to set a small laptop down on the podium. Sebelius punched in a few keystrokes in dramatic fashion, and Obama's video began to play as originally intended.  Comedian and actor Joel McHale, who spoke after Obama as the evening's entertainment, also targeted the once-troubled Obamacare site.  "The launch of HealthCare.gov was a disaster. It was so bad," McHale said, speaking directly to the President. "I don't even have an analogy because the website is now the thing people use to describe other bad things.  "They say things like, 'I shouldn't have eaten that sushi, because I was up all night HealthCare.gov-ing.'"  The president and McHale also used fodder from current headlines for many of their best moments of the night. Here are some of the highlights.  Christie's bridge troubles  After taking a jab at drawn out legislative battles with Washington lawmaker Ted Cruz, Obama joked that "gridlock has gotten so bad in this town, you have to wonder: What'd we do to piss off Chris Christie so bad?"  "Finally, a politician who is willing to stand up to America's commuters," McHale said of Christie, who chuckled along in the audience.  Shirtless Putin  Obama sought to turn recent conservative criticism of his foreign policy on its head by pointing out past compliments Putin has received from Pat Buchanan and Rudy Giuliani. In a dig at conservative pundits, Obama said, "Mike Huckabee and Sean Hannity keep talking about Putin's bare chestwhich is kind of weird. Look it up. They talk about it a lot."  McHale used the crisis in Ukraine to give Obama some foreign policy advice. "You have to show a guy like that you're just as crazy as he is. He invades Crimea, you invade Cancun," the comedian told the President.  Dousing the news media  Both men used the occasion to declare open season on the media, including CNN and its recent extensive coverage of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.  Obama told the audience he was a little jet-lagged from his recent trip to Asia which included a stop in Malaysia. "The lengths we have to go to, to get CNN coverage these days," the President said, adding, "I think they're still searching for their table."  McHale was no kinder. After remarking that the White House Correspondents' Association celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, McHale joked, "100 years ago, CNN was only searching for the Wright brothers' plane."  Obama also took a shot at MSNBC's ratings in the large, full ballroom.  "MSNBC is here. They're a little overwhelmed. They've never seen an audience this big before."  As for Fox News, the President joked that the cable outlet was a front for the Koch brothers, a pair of billionaire industrialists known for their monetary contributions to conservative groups and causes.  "I'm just kidding," Obama added, "Let's face it, Fox. You'll miss me when I'm gone. It'll be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya."  Racial tightrope walk  Obama played on skin color while taking a stab at House Speaker John Boehner, who has antagonized Obama on many issues in the last few years and who has his own host of problems with the conservative members of the House Republican Caucus.  "These days the House Republicans actually give John Boehner a harder time than they give mewhich means orange really is the new black," Obama said making a simultaneous reference to the popular Netflix series and to Boehner's legendary tan.  McHale walked the tightrope on race in a quip that is apt to draw some criticism when the sun comes up Sunday. The comedian is the host of "The Soup" on the E! Entertainment channel.  "E! is also home to the Kardashians, who believe it or not, are Republicans," McHale said, "And I know that because they're always trying to screw black people."  The joke seemed to draw more smarting moans from the audience than laughs.  Some serious stuff  Although the night is typically a light-hearted affair full of jokes, food, and posing for photos, discussion of serious news intruded on the red carpet.  News legend Barbara Walters spoke to CNN about her exclusive interview with V. Stiviano, the woman at the center of the racial scandal that has embroiled L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling.  "I think she wanted to do it," Walters told CNN when asked how she landed a sit-down with Stiviano, "I think she wanted to be heard. I think she feels there have been a lot of bad things said about her and this was her chance to show that she was intelligent."  The annual event, which has attracted a substantial Hollywood contingent since Bill Clinton was President in the early 1990s, is taking place this year at a time when politically themed showsABC's "Scandal," HBO's "Veep" and Netflix's "House of Cards"are prevalent in popular culture.  CNN Political Commentator Ben Ferguson summed up how the annual event seemed to upend pop culture's normal pecking order.  "This is the only place where Wolf Blitzer can actually be the hot ticket for a Hollywood star. . .  This is like revenge of every guy who ever went and studied hard in college," Ferguson said. "In what world does this happen?"  As to whether partisanship gets stirred up, S.E. Cupp of CNN's "Crossfire" said, "Actually, tonight we've decided to put politics aside, laugh at our own expense, rib each other, and just have a good night."  "That's what this is all about," CNN Political Analyst John Avlon said of the rare truce between the hosts on the left and the right of program. "There's so much humor in politics but you wouldn't know it because people don't laugh at it," he said, "so it's a good night for that."  "This is Hollywood for ugly people," Avlon added, using a familiar description Washingtonians often use to describe their city.  Also spotted on the red carpet by CNN before the dinner began: "Scandal's" Tony Goldwyn, Scott Foley, Joe Morton, Bellamy Young and Dan Bucatinsky; Sens. Charles Schumer, D-New York, and John McCain, R-Arizona; Attorney General Eric Holder; Cynthia Nixon; Patrick Stewart; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar; Washington "fixer" Judy Smith; Tim Tebow; Frida Pinto; IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde; Katie Couric; Richard Marx and the Winklevoss twins. Also in attendance were CNN's Jim Acosta, Michelle Kosinski, Dana Bash and Brianna Keilar.  The annual event is a fundraiser for "scholarships for aspiring journalists and awards recognizing excellence in the (journalism) profession," according to the website of the White House Correspondents' Association, the organization that sponsors the dinner.  The WHCA "works to maintain independent news media coverage of the president, advocating for access, handling logistics for pools of reporters who stay close to the president and those who travel with him, and providing scholarships to journalism students," the website says. The annual dinner began in 1920.  
 Kabul, Afghanistan China's top security official paid a surprise visit to Afghanistan, where he met with President Hamid Karzai on issues ranging from investment and bilateral trade to to terrorism and drug trafficking, China's state-run news agency said Sunday.  The visit Saturday by Zhou Yongkang, a member of Communist Party's politburo, the elite group of 25 men who run China, was the first visit by a top Chinese official since 1955, Xinhua reported.  Beijing kept the visit secret because of security concerns, the agency said.  "It is the consistent policy of the Chinese government and the (party) to consolidate and develop China-Afghanistan relations," Zhou said in a statement reported by Xinhua.  Zhou also said China is willing to make "due contributions" to peace and stability.  "We will continue to provide assistance to Afghanistan with no attached conditions and sincerely hope the Afghan people can regain peace as soon as possible and build a better home in a peaceful environment," he added.  Karzai and Chinese President Hu Jintao held a summit in Beijing in June. The two countries decided at the time to develop a strategic and cooperative partnership, Xinhua reported.

Washington Wayne LaPierre is not a large man. He does not move with the easy assurance of a skilled fighter. His head sits low on his neck, and he seems to turn from the shoulders.  His swept-back, graying hair and rimless glasses make him look like a Central Casting accountant who sleeps with a tie on. Yet, in Washington, LaPierre is a heavyweight of the first degree, a brawler who can make even brave politicians toss in the towel at the first sign of a scuffle.  The longtime executive vice president and public face of the National Rifle Association faced some of his toughest critics on Capitol Hill Wednesdayincluding California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, author of the updated bill hoping to again ban military-style assault riflesas he testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing titled "What Should America Do About Gun Violence?"  He argued that government should focus on enforcing existing gun laws rather than drafting new ones.  "Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals, nor do we believe that government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families," he told lawmakers.  NRA official to Congress: More gun laws not the answer  The tough champion of the Second Amendment has been taking heat since the NRA came out strongly in favor of armed security in every public school in America, days after the deadly shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.  But that's what makes LaPierre so formidable: his unflinching willingness to say aloud what many foes consider outrageous.  "Why is the idea of a gun good when it is used to protect the president of our country or the police, but bad when it is used to protect our children in our schools?"  NRA draws heat over shooting game  That was the head of the National Rifle Association speaking to a room packed with cameras and reporters a week after the Newtown school shooting. He was pushing the idea of armed guards in every school.  Critics howled. A headline in New York proclaimed "Gun Nut!" while another called him the "Craziest Man on Earth."  But LaPierre did not even blink, going on "Meet the Press" to say, "If it's crazy to call for armed officers in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy." For many of his supporters, that had the ring of common sense, and that's what makes Washington nervous.  LaPierre has been the leader of the NRA for more than 20 years, turning it into a political juggernaut. The group boasts more than 4 million members capable of pouring money into political races at the drop of a hat.  How the violent mentally ill can buy guns  More importantly, NRA fans have proved that they can be relied on to show up at the polls and savage any candidate, Democratic or Republican, who strays from the doctrine of the Second Amendment, as they see it.  And LaPierre is the man who commands that political wrath, frequently by unleashing a torrent of scathing accusations against those who would oppose him.  A few examples:   In a 1995 fundraising letter, he referred to federal agents enforcing gun laws as "jack booted thugs."   After 1999's Columbine High School massacre, he complained that gun owners in general, and NRA members in particular, were being unfairly portrayed as "... somehow a reckless, societal, pathogen; a mighty, extremist empire opposed to safety, caution and reason. That is a cruel and dangerous lie."   In 2000, he suggested that President Bill Clinton was allowing gun deaths to pile up to spur anti-gun sentiment among voters.   When Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot, LaPierre noted that the gunfire came close to a school, a designated "gun free" zone, and again he ripped into gun opponents. "That didn't make any difference. Their laws didn't work. Their lies don't ring true. And if Tucson tells us anything at all, it tells us this: government failed."  NRA clear on gun debate stance: Arm schools  Make no mistake: There is no indication that LaPierre is a loose cannon or someone who does not mind his words. To the contrary, they are chosen with the precision of a marksman.  Even if his opponents hate to admit it, he follows an unswervingly clear course with his statements; always attacking, never ceding even an inch, and relentlessly portraying those who would infringe on gun rights as radicals.  And he wins. Year after year, for all the bluster around gun issues, the NRA has emerged victorious, galvanizing millions of Americans who feel that government too often overreaches and intrudes upon individual freedoms.  Simply put, it is the language of motivation. And when it comes to guns, no one speaks it like Wayne LaPierre.  NRA chief: Obama makes 'mockery' of American freedoms  
 Wearing a blue prison uniform, O.J. Simpson testified Wednesday in a Las Vegas courtroom that his former attorney advised he could use some force to reclaim personal items from sports memorabilia dealers as long as he didn't trespass.  Simpson took the witness stand in an effort to get a new trial on his armed robbery, assault and kidnapping convictions stemming from the confrontation in 2007. He insists that his attorney in that case, Yale Galanter, didn't adequately represent him during the trial a year later.  Simpson said he trusted Galanter's advice on how to get the items back. He said he believed the items were stolen and he wanted to give them to his children someday.  "The overall advice that he gave me is that you have a right to get your stuff. He gave me an example that if you're walking the street and you see your laptop in a car, you can use force to break the window of the car," Simpson told the court.  "Yale is a pretty forceful guy, and he sort of takes over," Simpson said.  When Simpson expressed concerns about going to trial and possibly being convicted, "he said, 'Relax, relax, O.J. I got it, I got it. I will get you out of this,' " Simpson testified.  Galanter frequently stated "I got it, I got it," Simpson continued. "You could never really say what you're feeling because he got it."  The 65-year-old former football star was convicted of leading a group of associates into a room at the Palace Station hotel and casino and using threats, guns and force to take back items from the two dealers.  Simpson testified that Galanter advised him that he could demand his property back from the dealers, and if they refused to return it, he could use some force, but he could not trespass.  Simpson didn't discuss with his attorney, however, about whether any weapons would be used in the incident. Simpson and co-defendants would later be accused of using a weapon.  Galanter is scheduled to testify Friday in the proceedings on Simpson's new trial request.  On Wednesday, Simpson testified he didn't know of any weapons being present when he and five co-defendants confronted the memorabilia dealers in the hotel room.  "But I suspect" there were, he testified.  Of the five men who went with Simpson to the room, four pleaded guilty to reduced charges in exchange for their testimony at trial, but Clarence "C.J." Stewart faced a jury conviction alongside Simpson.  Stewart later won a court order for a new trial. In 2011, Stewart was sentenced to three years' probation after entering an Alford plea to robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery, meaning he didn't admit guilt but acknowledged that prosecutors could prove their case, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported then.  By testifying against his former attorney, Simpson waived his right to the attorney-client privilege in the 2007 case, but his attorney in this week's court proceedings said Simpson has no concerns about losing those protections.  "I am confident Mr. Simpson has not told him anything that would inculpate him because I'm confident the truth is he did not intend to commit any crime. So, no, I'm not worried,"  attorney Patricia Palm said.  A deputy escorted Simpson to the stand Wednesday and unlocked the manacles binding his hands to his waist. His feet were also shackled. The former NFL player was heavier and had more gray hair than when he gained notoriety in the mid-1990s in his trial on charges of killing his ex-wife and her friend. A jury acquitted him in that case.  In court Wednesday, Simpson recounted his working relationship with Galanter, who he said had a conflict of interest in the case and failed to mount an effective defense.  "Yale had a relationship with the media and he would go on various shows to refute the tabloid stories," Simpson said. "He had a good relationship with the media and consequently I was in the media a lot, and that gave him an opportunity to go on TV."  Under questioning by his attorney, Simpson seemed relaxed, alert and attentive to each question. His voice was low and at times raspy. His left wrist manacled to his waist, creating an image of a one-armed man as he gestured only with his right hand in animated moments.  The courtroom gallery is small, occupied mainly by journalists, and the hearing lacked the big media spectacle of prior Simpson court appearances.  The proceeding is being heard by Clark County District Judge Linda Marie Bell, who will also rule on Simpson's request.  In documents filed requesting the new trial, Simpson argued that Galanter prevented him from testifying on his own behalf, leaving nothing to challenge evidence put forward by prosecutors of criminal intent and other issues.  Because Simpson didn't testify in the 2008 trial, he now "wants to tell his story," attorney Osmaldo Fumo said Tuesday, the second day of the hearing.  "There are 19 issues here in our writ and all you need is one of them to be granted and Mr. Simpson gets a new trial," Fumo said. "It just seems overwhelming that more than one of them should or would be granted and I'm confident he'll get a new trial."  Simpson is serving a 33-year prison term and is eligible for parole in 2017.  Simpson lost an appeal of his verdict in 2010 in Nevada Supreme Court. Prosecutors say there is no evidence of conflict of interest and Simpson's claims are "without merit."  Simpson, who played in the NFL from 1969 to 1979, was acquitted in a criminal trial in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. A civil jury later slapped him with a $33 million wrongful-death judgment.  Documentary: Serial killer, not O.J., killed Simpson and Goldman

In increasingly virtual South Korea, the latest bizarre fad is watching someone eat online.  Called 'muk-bang' in Korean, which translates to 'eating broadcasts,' online channels live-stream people eating enormous servings of food while chatting away to those who are watching.  The queen of this particular phenomenon is the Diva, a waifish, pretty 33-year-old woman apparently blessed with the stomach capacity of several elephants and the metabolism of a hummingbird.  Every evening around 8 p.m, several thousand viewers tune in to watch The Divareal name Park Seo-Yeonbegin inhaling enough food for several college linebackers.  She easily polishes off four large pizzas or three kilograms (6 lb) of beef in one sitting, albeit over the span of several hours.  After she eats, she spends another two or three hours just talking to her fans, who communicate with her via a chat room which accompanies her live-stream channel.  For Park, online eating is not just a niche hobby but a significant source of income  she makes up to 10 million ($9,300) a month from her broadcasts alone.  Her costs are also high, however. She says she spends an average of $3,000 per month purchasing food for her show, which she broadcasts for about four to six hours per night.  Confessions of a Diva  Thanks to the live chat room that accompanies her channel, feedback is instantaneous and the show interactive.  Comments flood in and she reads from them in real time.  "My fans tell me that they really love watching me eat because I do so with so much gusto and make everything look so delicious," says Park.  "A lot of my viewers are on diets and they say they live vicariously through me, or they are hospital patients who only have access to hospital food so they also watch my broadcasts to see me eat."  While it would seem that her metabolism would make her public enemy number one, some of the Diva's biggest fans are women, and indeed her channel is more popular with women than with men, with a 60-40 ratio.  "One of the best comments I ever received from a viewer who said that she had gotten over her anorexia by watching me eat," says Park. "That really meant a lot to me."  She cooks about a third of the food that she eats, and the rest she has delivered. Offers of sponsorship have come in thick and  fast, but she says she tests out sponsored food first and only features what she truly likes and wants to share.  Her fans show their appreciation by sending her money, in the form of virtual tokens that can be cashed in.  Afreeca TV, the publicly-listed social networking site that hosts her channel, allows users to buy and send virtual "star balloons" which can be monetized after the site takes a 30-40% commission.  Any payment by viewers is purely voluntary, as all channels can be viewed for free.  The service is currently limited to South Korea, although the company has plans to expand it to other countries.  Cultural background  The Diva's success and the Korean eating broadcasting trend can be attributed to a number of specific cultural factors.  "We think it's because of three big reasons  the rise of one-person households in Korea, their ensuing loneliness and finally the huge trend of 'well-being culture' and excessive dieting in Korean society right now," says Afreeca TV public relations coordinator Serim An.  While watching food porn on a diet may sound like masochistic torture, apparently lonely, hungry Koreans prefer to eat vicariously.  Another thing, Koreans hate eating alone.  "For Koreans, eating is an extremely social, communal activity, which is why even the Korean word 'family' means 'those who eat together,'" says Professor Sung-hee Park of Ewha University's Division of Media Studies.  She believes its the interactive aspect of eating broadcasts that's so appealing to these lonely hearts.  Loneliness was also the catalyst for the Diva.  "So many of my friends were getting married and I was living alone and lonely and bored," she says.  "When I first started my channel two years ago, I was showing a variety of content, from dance to outdoor activities, but it was my love of eating that really began drawing a response from fans," says Park.  The setting  And then there's the platform to make the phenomenon possible in the first place.  It's difficult to imagine the unique live-streaming online platform of Afreeca TV working as well on a daily basis anywhere other than South Korea's extremely wired culture.  With 78.5% of the entire population on smartphones and 7 million people riding the Seoul subway network every day, Afreeca TV is becoming particularly popular with Korean commuters, given that the Seoul subway has cellphone reception and Wi-Fi, and South Korean smartphones have TV streaming capabilities.  "Our mobile users surpassed our PC users a while ago, and most of our viewers watch our content while they are on the move," says An.  The majority of Afreeca TV's content is actually online gaming, where individual broadcasters called 'BJs' (short for Broadcast Jockeys), stream their gaming live for others to learn from or comment on. Anyone can live-stream from any device as long as they log in.  "Eating broadcasts" began popping up around 2009, says An, when users began to imitate celebrities' food shows by commenting as they were eating while broadcasting.  Now, of the platform's 5,000 channels that are streaming at any given point in time, 5% of those are eating broadcasts. Afreeca TV has a daily average viewership of 3 million.  Spinning off  The Diva says her success was a huge surprise, but there are still many who don't understand the concept and are liberal with their criticism.  "I get some really awful commenters who make me reexamine 'why am I doing this again?' but at the end of the day the positive feedback overwhelmingly outweighs the bad, so I am happy to continue."  While Park maintained her real estate consulting day job over the past two years, she quit last week to focus more on her eating broadcasts and potential spinoff businesses, including a clothing company.  When asked if she has any time for a private life, considering she broadcasts more than six hours a day every day including weekends, the answer is that she doesn't need one.  "This is a lot more fun," she says.  
 Miami, Florida For Marco Rubio, life was simpler when it was tea time all the time.  When he was gunning for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in Florida, the former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives aggressively courted the state's conservative Tea Party activists. That strategy worked. Rubio was suddenly a Tea Party favorite. His stunning rise in the polls forced Florida's more moderate governor, Charlie Crist, to bolt the GOP primary to run as an independent.  But the race is now more complicated, with Rubio competing in a three-way battle royal against both Crist and the Democratic nominee, South Florida Rep. Kendrick Meek.  Rubio's grass-roots campaign has put together a team of high-powered Washington and Texas-based GOP consultants. Over the summer, this son of Cuban exiles distanced himself from Tea Partiers on one of the conservative movement's key issues, Arizona's tough anti-illegal immigration law.  "The original law allowed for racial profiling. I don't think they intended that. I don't believe they did. But the original language in that law allowed for racial and ethnic profiling. And they changed that, to their credit, a week later. They passed a bill that changed that," Rubio said.  Still, Rubio doesn't want even the amended Arizona legislation to become the law of the land. "I don't think the Arizona bill should serve as a model for the rest of the country," he added.  In an interview with CNN, Rubio blamed both parties for the nation's problems and said he plans to be his own man if elected to the Senate. "I represent the things I stand for," Rubio said.  Tea Party activists in Florida still support Rubio. But one of the movement's leaders, South Florida Tea Party Chairman Everett Wilkinson, says he will be watching Rubio's moves closely. "When you send a politician to Washington, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back," Wilkinson said.  One of the biggest worries among Tea Partiers is that Rubio will be another Scott Brown. The Massachusetts Republican had the backing of the Tea Party in his race to replace the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. But as a senator, Brown has shown his own independent streak and has voted on occasion with the Democrats. Not to fear, says Rubio, who is set to speak at a Tea Party rally in Florida later this month.  But the 39-year-old Republican nominee has good reason to consider a move to the political middle in this swing state. Crist's new ads tout the governor as a fresh independent voice, forcing both Rubio and Meek to defend their respective political bases.  That's created a fascinating sideshow in this three-ring political circus: an alliance of sorts between the Tea Party-backed Rubio and Meek. Nearly every day, both the Rubio and Meek campaigns send out e-mails blasting Crist. One of Meek's e-mails showcases a recent newspaper editorial in Florida that slammed Crist as a "campaign chameleon."  "Charlie Crist is trying to be indefinable in this race. And that has an expiration date on it. And that date has come and passed," Meek said in an interview with CNN. Crist declined to be interviewed for this story.  "I think people deserve to know what the next U.S. senator from Florida is going to be about," Rubio said. "The last thing we need in Florida is a political opportunist."

Folk singer Richie Havens, who died Monday at 72, was the opening act in 1969 at Woodstock, the historic counterculture music festival, catapulting him to fame and securing his status as an icon of the baby-boomer generation. Havens would tour widely for the next  40 years and release more than 20 albums. On the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock festival, Havens wrote this reflection for CNN.com in 2009.  Forty years ago this summer I wound up opening the Woodstock festival when the four acts scheduled before me were stuck in massive traffic jams and delayed in getting to the concert site in Bethel, New York.  My band had made it up from Manhattan in the early morning hours, and we had the least amount of gear to set up, so after some strong convincing from the promoters I agreed to go on.  The show was late in starting, and they were feeling pressure to start the music. We played for nearly three hours as they were still building the stage around me. I sang every song I knew, and when they asked me to go back on one more time, I improvised "Freedom."  When you see me in the movie tuning my guitar and strumming, I was actually trying to figure out what else I could possibly play! I looked out at all of those faces in front of me and the word "freedom" came to mind.  One of my strongest memories of that day is flying in the helicopter over that vast, spectacular crowd that had already stretched back over the hills and well out of view of the stage. Looking down, my only thought was, "This is incredible. ... We're really here and they can't hide us anymore."  I've been asked all summer long if I believe Woodstock is still significant and if I think another Woodstock is ever likely to happen. Well, certainly large three-day festivals are still happening all over: Coachella and Bonnaroo in the United States, the Isle of Wight and Glastonbury abroad, but the reality of what made Woodstock become such a historic event has definitely changed.  Woodstock happened in August 1969, long before the Internet and mobile phones made it possible to communicate instantly with anyone, anywhere. It was a time when we weren't able to witness world events or the horrors of war live on 24-hour news channels.  News coverage was filtered and selective, and we felt manipulated and silenced by the lack of information. So much was happening around us, and we didn't feel like we were being told the truth.  With everything that was going on in the late 1960sthe war in Vietnam, civil and human rights issues, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassinationwe rallied and relied on strength in numbers. We came together communally to be heard and to be acknowledged.  Though it's frequently portrayed as this crazy, unbridled festival of rain-soaked, stoned hippies dancing in the mud, Woodstock was obviously much more than thator we wouldn't still be talking about it in 2009. People of all ages and colors came together in the fields of Max Yasgur's farm.  Some traveled for days or weeks to get there. The world was quickly changing, and none of us was willing to sit and just watch it go by. We needed to feel like part of the change and that spontaneous coming together felt like the world's biggest family reunion!  When Wavy Gravy said, "What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000," that's what it felt like: hundreds of thousands of friends and loved ones taking care of one another. Woodstock was both a peaceful protest and a global celebration.  
 SAN ANTONIO, Texas  The three Americans rescued after more than five years in captivity in Colombia say they are doing well but are "overwhelmed with emotion," according to a statement released on their behalf.  "Words alone can never possibly express the thrill and excitement we feel to be back home in the United States of America with our families at our side," the Friday statement from Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell said.  The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) had held the three U.S. government contractors since February 2003, after their plane crashed in a remote region of the South American country.  They were among 15 hostages rescued Wednesday in a Colombian military operation.  Watch Colombians celebrate success   Also among the rescued hostages was French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt, who returned to France on Friday. She is undergoing medical tests at a Paris military hospital, The Associated Press reported.  Watch Betancourt's joyous return to France   Shortly after the plane crashed, FARC members killed contractor Tom Janis, according to employer Northrop Grumman, and Colombian army Sgt. Luis Cruz, according to the U.S. State Department.  The three freed Americans are being treated at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.  Learn about the former hostages   "For five-and-a-half long years, we all hoped and prayed this day would come," their statement said. "Now that it has, we're just overwhelmed with emotion. The love and the joy we're all experiencing is beyond description.  "We want to offer our heartfelt thanks to the government and the armed forces of Colombia. The operation they conducted to rescue us was one for the history bookssomething we will never forget for the rest of our lives."  Colombian authorities unveiled details and a videotape Friday describing the mission, which involved tricking the leftist rebels into giving up their hostages.  Watch video of the rescue   Government agents had infiltrated the FARC leadership over several months. This week they talked the rebels into moving the hostages, saying a humanitarian group wanted to check on them.  A helicopter carrying fake rebels picked up the hostages at a rendezvous point, ostensibly to take them to another rebel camp. It actually was a government helicopter, and the hostages were whisked to freedom without a shot being fired.  Learn about FARC   On Thursday, doctors at the Brooke Army Medical Center said the three Americans appeared to be in good health. Initial tests had for now ruled out the suspicion of infectious diseases, and although other medical tests are pending, "everything really looks well," said Col. Jackie Hayes, a psychiatrist and the lead physician on the men's medical team.  Hayes said patient confidentiality rules prevented him from commenting on reports that Gonsalves was suffering from hepatitis.  Maj. Gen. Keith Huber, commander of U.S. Army South, said the contractors were in the second phase of a three-phase process designed to ease their transition back to normal life.  "They greeted me with a strong handshake and clear eyes and an incredible smile," he said.

Every week, there's a new Facebook thing to gripe about.  This week, there have been twoand it's only Tuesday.  On Sunday, it was discovered that the 900 million-person social network was "testing" a feature that would let people see a digital list of the people who were nearby in real life. Called "Find Friends Nearby," the app was pulled down by Tuesday morning after the Internet freaked out. Commenters said things like "Hell to the naw" and "BAD FACEBOOK!!" and generally complaining that the feature, which was difficult to find, much less use, invades privacy and will lead to stalking.  If that's not enough, a company named Friendthem reportedly threatened a lawsuit, saying Facebook stole its idea for the location-aware feature. Apparently, Friendthem would like to share the heat.  Item two: A blogger noticed over the weekend that Facebook, without asking permission, had changed the default e-mail addresses of all of its digital residents to @facebook.com accounts. It's easy enough to change back, as the site Lifehacker and others have detailed, but that little invasion of the hub of digital identitythe Facebook Timelinewas enough to make quite a few Facebookers fire back at their digital overlords. Security researchers called the move dangerous. Normal people felt violated.  "Up next: Facebook inside your underwear drawer!" a commenter wrote on our site.  So that was this week. But it seems like every week has been feeling a little like that.  The fact that an anti-Facebook sentiment bubbles beneath the currents of modern life is, of course, nothing new. When the company introduced the now-popular News Feed in September 2006, users threw a fitand many abandoned the young network, at least for a moment.  Let's put the brakes on for just a second and ask a few questions:  Are people mad about Facebook's individual decisionsthe e-mail, the tracking, the News Feedor do the roots of this discontent reach into deeper, darker places? If it's the latter, why are people so continually frustrated? Do we hold Facebook to too high of a standard? Is the social network turning its back on users? Or is it just that our digital lives are now so invested in Facebook that it would be nearly impossible to pull out at this pointand, because of that, we feel helpless?  Here are a few theories about what's actually going on with people's unhappiness with Facebook. Take a look and let us know which you think is most accurateor offer up a theory of your ownin the comments.  Facebook has become an octopus  And by "octopus" we mean it's got too many tentacles to manage. This theory is put forward by the blog the Next Web, which says Facebook is buying too many new companiesInstagram, Glanceeand trying too many new things. (This is a critique more commonly lobbed at Google, especially when it was launching one product after the next that flopped: Google Wave, Google Buzz, etc., etc.)  "When you start packing in more features while you're removing none of them, feature creep will happen and users will start to ask the question 'Why can't they just make it easy for me to talk to my friends?' " Drew Olanoff wrote. "After all, that's why people started leaving MySpace to go to Facebook in the first place, because it simply tried to do too much."  Writing for Forbes, Kashmir Hill puts it this way: "Facebook would love to be the all-inclusive resort of the Web, replete with complementary digital daiquiris (that you're forced to chug) upon entry."  Facebook is a technocracy, and we want a democracy  As Alexis Madrigal writes for the Atlantic, Facebook has evolved into a "technocracy": a government of sorts that's run by engineers who value efficiency above all else. When you complain to the real-world government, you can expect a responseor you can use your voting power (or run for office) to push for change. At Facebook, 2 million complaints per week are handled largely by computers and a staff of a few hundred people. Their aim is to process as many issues per day as possible, to help people connect and, as Madrigal puts it, to stop people from leaving the site "by minimizing their negative experiences."  "Facebook's desire for efficiency means democracy is out and technocratic, developer-king rule is in," he writes.  Even when the site does give its users a chance to weigh in on policy, Madrigal says, users don't take up the offer. In a vote about a recent privacy policy change, 0.038% of users participated.  There's no competition  Hope and pray all you want, but there's no other online social network with 900 million people. Chances are, most of your friends are on Facebook, so even if you try to go to a competing network like Google+, it might be as fun as talking to your cat. Here's a list of alternatives from our What's Next blog, but none of them seems like actual competition in terms of numbers.  Facebook cares more about investors than users  Facebook went public this year, leading to criticisms that the site's motives have changed. Is it focused on cash instead of users?  While that complaint may be prematureCEO Mark Zuckerberg maintains a majority stake in the company, so he doesn't have to listen to investors and his board all that muchthe company's IPO, and the billionaires and millionaires who resulted from it, doubtlessly cloud how people see Facebook's motives. And it doesn't help to know that, in mid-May, you were worth only $1.21 to Facebook.  "How much does Facebook value its users? In strictly monetary terms, about as much as a bag of chips," David Goldman wrote for our sister site CNNMoney.com.  Or, as Slate put it, Facebook is "conducting an experiment in corporate dictatorship nearly without precedent for such a large and high-profile company."  Facebook is no fun (anymore ...)  I put the question of what's really wrong with Facebook out on my Google Plus feed, in part because that network is a hotbed for Facebook defectors. Several followers brought up interesting points, the simplest of which is that Facebook, as it grew, became un-fun.  "Facebook started as a social network that was 'fun' to update your friends and classmates (since it started for-college students only) and grew into something that can affect your career, reputation and invade your privacy," one user, identified as Julie Hancher, wrote.  Here's another thought, from a person identified as Robert Sons:  "Bombardment with stories you don't care about from people you barely care about. Depression that you're jealously stalking other's lives instead of living your own. Shallowness of content. The more content you absorb, the less valuable your own posts seem."  And I'll give the final word to Carlos Ochoa, who wrote, simply: "Everyone uses Facebook but nobody likes it."  Let us know what you think in the comments below.  
 Washington The U.S. military has blocked access to a range of popular commercial websites in order to free up bandwidth for use in Japan recovery efforts, according to an e-mail obtained by CNN and confirmed by a spokesman for U.S. Strategic Command.  The sitesincluding YouTube, ESPN, Amazon, eBay and MTVwere chosen not because of the content but because their popularity among users of military computers account for significant bandwidth, according to Strategic Command spokesman Rodney Ellison.  The block, instituted Monday, is intended "to make sure bandwidth was available in Japan for military operations" as the United States helps in the aftermath of last week's deadly earthquake and tsunami, Ellison explained.  U.S. Pacific Command made the request to free up the bandwidth. The sites, 13 in all, are blocked across the Department of Defense's .mil computer system.  "This is a response to a time of extreme demand for networks," Ellison said.  Ellison emphasized that it was a temporary measure.  "This blockage will be of a temporary nature and may increase or decrease in the size and scope as necessary," according to the message distributed to military announcing the move.  "We are doing this to facilitate the recovery efforts under way in Japan," Ellison explained. "We are trying to make sure we are giving them as many avenues and as much support as we can."  The blocked websites are:  * Youtube.com  * Googlevideo.com  * Amazon.com  * ESPN.go.com  * eBay.com  * Doubleclick.com  * Eyewonder.com  * Pandora.com  * streamtheworld.com  * Mtv.com  * Ifilm.com  * Myspace.com  * Metacafe.com

A beloved Roman Catholic priest was found dead Wednesday in his church's rectory, spurring police to launch a murder investigation and those he touched to try to make sense of his sudden passing.  Eureka, California, Police Chief Andy Mills said officersresponding to a call from staff at St. Bernard Churchfirst came across the victim around 9 a.m. Wednesday. He did not elaborate on how the death occurred, adding Wednesday night that there were no suspects.  Mayor Frank Jager identified the victim as the Rev. Eric Freed, whom he called a personal friend and a "tremendous person in this community" since his arrival three years ago. The St. Bernard Parish website featured a cross and the words, "Rest in Peace," above Freed's name.  "He was a really, genuinely warm individual," said professor Stephen Cunha, the chairman of Humboldt University's religious studies department where Freed taught for more than 10 years. "... Kind is the word that comes to mind, sensitive."  Noting that students at the state university loved Freedwho was also deeply involved in that school's Catholic student group, the Newman CenterCunha added: "This was not some stuffy clergyman. He was very much someone that you could sit down and speak with...  "He connected with everybody."  Local and state authorities remained at St. Bernard Churchone of two in the coastal Northern California city situated 275 miles north of San Francisco where he was the sole pastorlate Wednesday processing the crime scene and following up on tips, Mills said.  Those efforts include looking for Freed's vehicle, a 2010 Nissan Altima. The police chief said that authorities had no solid leads.  Just a few days ago, the priest sent a note to his parishioners thanking them for their support and prayers and wishing them a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.  "I cannot tell you how proud and honored I am to be your pastor," Freed wrote in a letter posted on the parish website. "Our parish is alive, joyful and full of faith, hope and charity that define us as Catholic Christians."  While he was relatively new to St. Bernard, Freed had already made an impact there and elsewhere around Eurekaincluding with the city's Japanese-American community, as Freed lived in Japan for many yearsJager told reporters.  "This is an absolutely tremendous loss not only for the St. Bernard's Parish, but for our community generally," the mayor said. "For those of us who believe in prayer, this is the time for that."  His ties to Humbodt State went back even longer. A guest lecturer, Freed wrote a book about the first atomic bomb and also taught about the New Testament, connecting with Christians and non-Christians alike.  "He was very well respected, very well liked and had a tremendous working knowledge as well as academic knowledge," Cunha said. "... To think that he passed in this way: It's just layers of grief and shock."  
 Division Street runs across Chicago, separating the city more than just geographically.  Teddy Williams knows this well. He grew up in the 1980s in Chicago's infamous Cabrini Green housing project on Division, a street he said stays true to its name.  Though the neighborhood was notorious for its gang-infested streets and violence, Williams, now 40, remembers the neighborhood differently. He remembers playing with his childhood friends, running up and down hallways of his apartment building, and listening to Slick Rick on big boom boxes.  "It was a village," said Williams. "We all knew each other, we were all there for each other. There were people who do bad things, but that's everywhere."  Sam Spitz knew a very different side of Division Street. He went to school in the 1990s and 2000s, just a few blocks away, where he attended Near North Montessori School on West Division. He described his childhood as relatively safe and comfortable.  He still plays basketball on Mondays with his old classmates and passes Cabrini Green to get there.  "I used to pass by there everyday," said Spitz, 23. "But all I knew about the neighborhood was what I'd seen on TV. It didn't seem like a place I wanted to go."  In 2011, a crane reduced to rubble the building Williams once called home, a high-rise that was part of the Cabrini Green housing project.  He watched as the crane's steel teeth ripped into the 15-story building, floor by floor, eventually reaching his own 12th floor unit, crumbling it in a cloud of dust.  Just a few months before, Williams and thousands of others had been evicted from the Cabrini Green housing project.  "It was sudden, all of it was sudden," he said. "We got a notice for a few months and out of nowhere, we all had to get out."  He said the empty feeling still remains.  "It's like a part of your body is missing, like a leg or something."  "I will always know Cabrini as home."  'A refugee in my own city'  Chicago has demolished dozens of public housing high risesincluding those in Cabrini Greenas part of its "Plan for Transformation," a $1.5 billion project launched in 2000 to renovate or construct 25,000 public housing family units.  Chicago once had the second largest stock of public housing in the nation, with 43,000 units housing hundreds of thousands of people.  When the units became overrun with gangs and crime, the city embarked on an overhaul.  The plan aims "to build and strengthen communities by integrating public housing and its leaseholders into the larger social, economic and physical fabric of Chicago," according to the Chicago Housing Authority.  Chicago wanted stop managing public housing and become what the housing authority called "a facilitator of housing opportunities." Some residents of housing slated for demolition were given vouchers to rent apartments in the private market or moved into rehabbed public housing on the far south and west sides away from the city center.  Teddy Williams had a difficult time finding stable housing after his eviction in 2011.  "I felt something like a refugee in my own city," he said.  He turned to alcohol to cope with his pain and looked to friends and family to find a place to stay.  He finally stopped smoking and drinking "cold turkey," but his living situation became more difficult. For a time, Williams made his home on one of Chicago's "L" trains, which run the longest north-south route across the city.  He carried clothes and a brick from his old building as he patiently searched for a new chapter in his life.  Even today, he has trouble finding words to describe that experience, only saying it was "rough at times."  'A different world'  As he struggled to find a place to live, Williams found a job as a barber on the city's north side. He had only been in the barber shop for a couple of weeks in the fall of 2012 when college student Sam Spitz walked in, looking for a back-to-school haircut.  "He came in as a walk-in. From there we connected," Williams recalled. "He was reading a book and I was interested in knowing what it was and he told me that it was for a class. From there I started to get nosy in his business and he told me he was in school for film, so I decided to tell him a bit of my story and it went from there."  Spitz remembers the meeting.  "When I told Teddy I was in a film class he said, 'Man, you gotta make a movie about me!'" Spitz said, laughing. "At first I thought, 'Damn, I just want a haircut. Now this guy's got me trapped in his chair for 45 minutes and I have to listen to a pitch!'"  As Spitz and Williams talked over that haircut, they realized they had Division Street in common.  "I told him my dad and I used to drive by his building on the way home from school," Spitz said. "He asked if I ever got out of the car and I had to tell him the truth: 'No, I was scared.'"  Williams offered to take Spitz for a walk down his side of Division Street, a journey they documented in their film, "The Greens."  In the documentary, which took about a year to make, Williams introduces Spitz to Lonza C. Harris Jr., a former Gangster Disciples member known as "Batman" whose story complicates the narratives that Spitz saw as a child on TV.  "I'll never forget our first walk down Division," Spitz said. He remembers Teddy telling him about the time he chipped his tooth running a race through his buildings with other children.  "Teddy and Batman's stories made me question what I'd seen on TV," Spitz said. "I'd never thought of the high rises as homes."  Spitz hopes that his film, which was completed last fall, will encourage audiences to think critically about the stories they see on TV, especially those concerning Chicago. He and Williams are using the 20-minute film to start conversations on college campuses, an opportunity Williams said he could have never imagined.  "We hope others will take the time to learn from each other no matter how different we seem," Williams said.  Williams now lives in a suburb on the city's west side in his own apartment. Despite the lack of a police presence and the frequent sound of gunshots, Williams said he sees it as a symbol of his own progress. Yet, he still longs for his home in Cabrini Green.  "It was a village. We were a community," he said.  Today, Cabrini Green is infused with chic dining spots, expensive town homes and a growing shopping district. Just blocks away from the city's Magnificent Mile, some are calling it Chicago's "neighborhood of the future."  Williams said he would love to help instill that sense of community back into his old neighborhood.  "I want to recreate a place that I knew once, and provide that for someone else," he said. "I can help because I know what it needs."

Olympic gold medalist Sherone Simpson of Jamaica plans to file an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after receiving an 18-month doping suspension Tuesday, with her agent calling the ban "incredibly unjust."  Simpson, who won gold at the 2004 Olympics in the 4x100-meter relay, silver in the 100 meters at the 2008 Games and silver in the 4x100-meter relay at the 2012 Olympics, tested positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrine at last year's Jamaican national championships.  The 29-year-old revealed last yearon the same day former 100-meter world-record holder Asafa Powell of Jamaica and former world champion Tyson Gay of the U.S. said they had tested positive for banned substancesthat she would never "intentionally take an illegal substance of any form" but Jamaica's anti-doping disciplinary panel Tuesday claimed she was "negligent," The Jamaican Gleaner newspaper reported.  The ban is backdated to last June, which means Simpson would be able to return to competition this December.  "The panel has given no written explanation as to how or why they came to this decision," Simpson's agent, Paul Doyle, said in a statement sent to CNN. "We feel that this ruling is incredibly unjust and we will be appealing to the Court of Arbitration (for) Sport immediately."  Doyle added that the case for CAS should be "very straightforward."  "Sherone took a legal supplement that was contaminated with oxilofrine," said Doyle. "Two different labs that we commissioned to test the supplement both determined that oxilofrine was present and that it was not declared on the label.  "Additionally, on our advisement (the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency) ordered the supplement directly from the company and tested it themselves and confirmed the same. Subsequently, USADA has posted a warning on their website warning athletes not to take the supplement because it contains banned substances that are not declared on the label.  "These are the core facts of Sherone's case and cannot be disputed. Typically in such a case, the athlete is given a punishment ranging from a public warning to three months of ineligibility. The fact that the panel has given 18 months suspension and have provided no explanation as to why is unacceptable in our opinion."  It was a double blow Tuesday for Jamaican athletes, since discus thrower Allison Randall received a two-year doping suspension, The Gleaner said.  Powell, who also tested positive for oxilofrine, is expected to learn his fate Thursday. Simpson and Powell share the same physical trainer, according to The Gleaner.  Simpson will be hoping for the same ruling handed out by CAS in February in the case of decorated Jamaican sprinter Veronica Campbell-Brown.  Campbell-Brown, who has won more than a dozen Olympic and world championship medals, had her two-year ban for testing positive for a banned diuretic last May overturned.  
 Are we alone in the universe? Findings by NASA's Kepler space telescope are making that seem less likely.  NASA scientists have announced Kepler has spotted five planets about the size of Earth, orbiting stars in our galaxy.  These planets are orbiting in what is known as the habitable zone, which puts them at a distance from their suns where liquid water could exist. Liquid water is a key ingredient for life to form.  "In a generation we have gone from extraterrestrial planets being a mainstay of science fiction, to the present, where Kepler has helped turn science fiction into today's reality," said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.  The Kepler science team also announced the telescope found six planets, all larger than Earth, orbiting a single sun-like star.  That star is some 2,000 light years from Earth.  To date, the telescope has detected more than 1,200 planet candidates. The fact that so many planets have been found in the Milky Way galaxy "suggests there are countless planets orbiting sun-like stars in our galaxy," said William Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator.  Kepler does not actually see the planets themselves. The telescope sees tiny decreases in light from the stars as planets transit across their suns.  The five Earth-sized planets are orbiting stars cooler and smaller than our sun, and further analysis is still necessary to officially confirm they are planets.

The first day of voting in Egypt's presidential election was relatively quiet, state media reported Monday, though one man connected to a campaign was shot to death.  Polls will reopen at 9 a.m. Tuesday for the last day of voting. Egyptians are choosing between two candidates: Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Hamdeen Sabahy.  Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb declared Tuesday a public holiday "in compliance to citizens' wishes," state TV reported. The decision is thought to be a move to increase turnout.  Public service ads, media campaigns and the electoral ads of the el-Sisi campaign stressed that voting is a patriotic duty.  The election was called because Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first freely elected president, was removed from power in July in a popular military coup.  A man working for el-Sisi's campaign was fatally shot near Cairo on Monday, Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said.  Mohamed Fathy, 35, was getting out of a taxi in the village of Kerdassa on the western edge of Cairo when he was shot in the head by unknown gunmen, Mahmoud said.  Fathy was active in the el-Sisi presidential campaign and was a member of the Tamarod political movement, according to a statement from Tamarod.  Police are investigating, but Assistant Interior Minister for Information Abdel-Fattah Othman has said the slaying has nothing to do with the election process.  Tamarod has blamed the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group, which had held a small protest in Kerdassa earlier in the day.  Abdul Mawgoud Dardery, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, criticized the election: "What you have in Egypt now is not democracy but a militacracy. ... What we have now is Mubarak coming back. Sisi is Mubarak version 2014, and that is the tragedy."  Mahmoud also said a bomb was detected and defused at the Ahmed Sayed I school polling station in Giza.  Egypt's state-run news agency MENA reported clashes in a polling station at Umraniya district but said they didn't disrupt the vote.  Beni Suef Security Director Ibrahim Hadib said that seven members of the Muslim Brotherhood were arrested for trying to disrupt the electoral process in that town, MENA reported.  A number of people hurled Molotov cocktails at the headquarters of el-Sisi's campaign in the town of Hosh Issa. No material damage or casualties were reported, MENA said.  The Sabahy campaign similarly reported disruptions.  "The day has sadly witnessed many violations observed, documented and announced by the campaign, led by banning Sabahy delegates from entering polling centers, collective voting, physical assaults against delegates and lawyers, let alone some cases of intervention by police and army forces," it said in a statement.  "The campaign hopes that these violations would not repeat tomorrow."

 Days of heavy rain have led to flooding in southwestern England and parts of Wales and at least one fatality, British authorities said Sunday.  The UK Environment Agency posted a severe flood alert for the town of Helston, in the southwestern county of Cornwall, where the River Cober was rising over its banks, and warned towns across England and Wales to prepare for more high water. In Exeter, in neighboring Devon, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her Saturday night, the Devon and Cornwall Police Service reported.  The Environment Agency said more than 800 properties have flooded since Wednesday. And the Met Office, the UK's national weather service, said more rain is forecast for the areabut the wettest weather will be in the north.  "We can expect between 30 and 40 millimeters (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches) of rain falling in many areas and up to 70 millimeters (2 3/4 inches) of rain in parts of northeast England, continuing the risk of further flooding and travel disruption," forecaster Eddy Carroll said in a news release.  On Twitter, Prime Minister David Cameron called the scenes of flooding "shocking" and said his government would make sure "everything is being done to help."  The region has seen four days of non-stop rainfall that has capped months of heavy precipitation, including the wettest April-June period on record. More than 225 areas stretching from Cornwall through the Midlands region to the northeastern coast were under flood warnings Sunday afternoon as the latest system moved through, the Environment Agency said.  Officials warned residents to use the daylight to prepare for more flooding Sunday and into the early hours of Monday.  CNN's Susannah Palk and Matt Smith contributed to this report.

It's a brief reprieve for hundreds of Syrian civilians trapped for months in a besieged city.  The Syrian government and opposition have agreed to extend a truce in Homs by another three days, the United Nations said.  "I hope this will allow us to evacuate yet more civilians and deliver much needed additional supplies," said Valerie Amos, the U.N. humanitarian chief.  "The protection of civilians caught up in this horrendous conflict in Syria is the greatest priority for U.N. agencies and humanitarian partners."  More than 800 civilians have been given safe passage out of the city since the deal was put in place Friday, she said in a statement.  Syria's Red Crescent tweeted that a group of around 300 people were taken to safety early Monday.  Parts of Homs have been under siege since June 2012.  Under fire in Homs  The U.N.-brokered truce has been violated several times.  Vehicles from the Red Crescent and United Nations had a difficult time entering the city over the weekend as they were targeted by gunfire and explosives.  Eleven people were killed as the operations were being carried out, said Amos.  "People seeking refuge and those carrying out humanitarian operations should not be fired on," Amos said in a statement  "U.N. and Red Crescent workers told me that many of the people who left Old Homs were traumatized and weak. They also said that they witnessed terrible conditions at the field hospital in the Old City, where the equipment is basic, there are no medicines and people are in urgent need of medical attention."  Social media video from inside Homs captured some of the chaotic scenes as desperate people lined up for a chance to leave.  One clip shows dozens of residents sitting or standing around several U.N. vans. An activist behind camera comments that are not enough vehicles for all the waiting families, while a U.N. worker yells: "We need to move and we will come back."  Another part of the same video shows a woman looking desperately for her lost son. "How can I leave without him? He is my son," she says and screams out his name.  Homs is just one of 40 besieged communities in Syria, according to the U.N.'s World Food Programme, which says about a quarter of a million people have been cut off from humanitarian aid for months.  The conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives and displaced millions more since it began in 2011, creating a major humanitarian crisis within Syria and for its neighbors.  New Round of Peace talks  As the regime and opposition swapped accusations over the truce violations, Syria's warring sides began a new round of peace talks in Geneva.  United Nations envoy Lakhdar Brahimi met with the Syrian opposition Monday morning before separate talks with government representatives.  The second round of talks center around the formation of a transitional governmental body and the cessation of violence.  The opposition delegation said each side would meet with Brahimi separately until the U.N. envoy decided there was common ground for joint discussions.  The first round of talks ended some 10 days ago, with no firm agreements and bitter statements from both sides.  The government insists that the talks focus on fighting "terrorism"its description of the uprisingbut the opposition says the priority should be the removal of President Bashar al-Assad.  The opposition has insisted that the government commit in writing to the 2012 Geneva I communique, which called for the formation of a transitional government.  Al-Assad's government has ruled out any transfer of power.  Brahimi will meet with high-level Russian and U.S. diplomats in Geneva this week, the U.N. said Monday.  He will meet with Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Gennady Gatilov and U.S. Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Friday, the U.N. said without providing more details.  In a separate development, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced a third shipment of chemical weapons material from Syria had taken place.  It said the material was on board a Norwegian cargo vessel accompanied by a naval escort from China, Denmark, Norway, and Russia.  "In-country destruction of some chemical materials has taken place alongside the removal of chemical weapons material," it added.  
 With arms around each other's shoulders, Wu Yebin and An Wei strolled past rows of food booths and game stalls along the main road cutting through their small village in northern China one recent Friday morning.  Looking like two buddies soaking in the sights and sounds of the village fair, the young men wearing matching rings blended in perfectly with the local crowd. Their story, however, stands out: They are an openly gay couple living in the Chinese countryside, where homosexuality remains largely taboo.  "They sought medical treatment for me and hired a shaman to exorcise me," recalled Wu of his family's reaction when he came out. "I had to complybut at the same time I found information on homosexuality online and shared with them.  "The more they learned, the more accepting they became," he added.  It took his parents several years to come around, but Wu and Anwho had met online and quickly fallen in lovenow live together and run a roadside convenience store next to the Wu family home in rural Hebei province.  As news of advancements in gay rights in other countries spreads, the two partners in life and business have been thinking more about cementing their own relationship.  "I hope to see same-sex marriage become legal in China one day," An, 32, said. "We'll go get the license right away to enjoy all the rights like married straight couples."  "It's going to happen," Wu, 29, chimed in. "I bet next year."  Not everyone is so optimistic though. A lesbian couple in Beijing recently saw their marriage application rejected by local officials and video of their futile attempt made the rounds on the Internet.  Activists also complain about periodic government crackdowns, citing a recent case in May. In the central city of Changsha, a 19-year-old activist leading a street rally against homophobia was jailed for 12 days. Local police accused him of "holding an illegal protest" in a statement.  "They aren't just targeting gay groups," said Xiaogang Wei, a prominent gay rights advocate who heads the Beijing Gender Health Education Institute. "The authorities are increasingly worried about the organizational capability of various rights groups, especially when we band together, because it could challenge their political power.  "Sometimes we have to take to the streets to raise the visibility of our cause," he added. "It stirs discussion and debate, which could eventually lead to more understanding and acceptance."  Homosexuality is not illegal in China and the Communist government has long removed it from the official list of mental disorders, but activists and experts agree that prejudices and discrimination persist.  "Gay people still can't make their voices heard and they have no representation in the legislature," said Li Yinhe, a renowned sociologist with the Chinese Academy of Social Science.  In China, LGBT citizens seek acceptance  Li conducted China's first comprehensive surveys on gay men and published her findings in a popular 1992 book. For more than a decade, she has been calling on national legislators to legalize same-sex marriage but sees a prolonged uphill battle ahead.  "This is an issue affecting a minority group and ranks really low on the government's agenda," she said.  Opposition to a different kind of "gay marriage," however, has become a priority for many activists. Unlike in the West, experts say the vast majority of gay people in Chinaespecially menstay in the closet and marry the opposite sex.  Noting the lack of hostility toward homosexuality throughout Chinese history, Li explains that the Confucian concept of carrying on the family line is "the only thing akin to religion in traditional Chinese culture.  "That's why so many gay men are put under tremendous pressure to get married and have children, especially in the countryside."  An had three girlfriends and almost tied the knot with the last one. Wu was married to a woman for 40 daysand regrets have dogged him since.  "Sometimes when I lie on bed, I think of my ex-wife and still feel guilty," he said, recalling how much she cried during their brief sexless marriage. "My momentary lapse of judgment ruined her life: Even though I never touched her, it'd be hard for her to find an ideal husband as a divorcee."  State media has cited one estimate putting the number of Chinese women married to gay men at more than 10 million. Sociologist Li calls those unions "tragedies" and has counseled many women in such marriages.  While a nationwide support network has emerged to help so-called "gay wives"or "tongqi" in Chinesebreak free, observers note a small but growing number of young gay men in big cities marrying lesbians to placate families and maintain their lifestyles at the same time.  Wu and An are no fans of such arrangements, and predict personal and financial complications.  After he met An, Wu started tweeting on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter with more than 300 million users. By telling his own story and re-posting news on global gay rights campaigns, Wu hopes to inspire more closeted gay Chinese to come out.  Remembering his own days of feeling lonely, helpless and even suicidal, Wu points to his experience as evidence of progress and hope in gay acceptance in Chinaeven in the most unlikely families and places.  Back at the village fair, Wu and Anwhose rural hometown has no cinemas let alone gay barspaused for a "face-changing" opera performance as an actor quickly switched colorful masks on stage without revealing his identity.  After cheering the entertainer, the two young men who have taken off their "masks" in real life moved on to buy groceries as meat and vegetable sellers greeted them as old friends.  "Many people say they admire usthey say we did something amazing," Wu said. "We are just two ordinary people who came out to our families so that we can live with our loved ones."  And maybe one day, get married.

A full moon hung just right in the night sky as the fierce Southern Army faced the encroaching Union troops in the spring of 1863.  Though they were outmanned and outgunned, the momentum of the war seemed to be on the side of Generals Robert E. Lee and "Stonewall" Jackson in Northern Virginia.  But the tide turned in the American Civil War not long after Jackson's own men inadvertently shot him that May night at the battle of Chancellorsville in Virginia.  And for that, say two researchers, Americans can thank that full moon.  It's an intriguing concept put forth by astronomer Don Olson and researcher Laurie E. Jasinski from Texas State University in a study appearing in this month's issue of Sky & Telescope magazine.  They say that when the men of the 18th North Carolina Infantry Regiment fired upon Jackson, the whitish lunar light likely obscured the target.  They didn't know it was him.  In other words, they say, a moon phase is partly responsible for the molding of a nation "dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal," as President Abraham Lincoln put it in the Gettysburg Address.  The two reconstructed the scene of the shooting using moon phases and maps, and published the results 150 years after the incident.  Moonlight or no?  History seems divided on whether or not the moon shone bright that night, the researchers say, but they back up their hypothesis with recorded anecdotal accounts.  "The Moon was shining very brightly, rendering all objects in our immediate vicinity distinct...," one confederate captain wrote years later. "The Moon poured a flood of light upon the wide, open turnpike."  Jackson rode out with a party of officers on a scouting mission to see if the Confederate Army could find a way to cut off Union Army troops, according to the National Park Service, which cares for the nation's Civil War battlegrounds.  They were shot as they returned.  Olson and Jasinski say that a Confederate officer spotted them in the moonlight and ordered his men to open fire.  Jackson was wounded in his left arm, which had to be amputated, according to the Virginia Military Institute, where Jackson taught.  He died from complications on May 10, 1863.  His arm was buried separate from the rest of his body.  The South went on to win the Battle of Chancellorsville, but without Jackson, took a decisive blow in July 1863 at the bloody Battle of Gettysburg, often thought of as the turning point of the war.  Back lighting  If Jackson's reconnaissance party was riding in bright moonlight, then his own men should have recognized them as they returned from the Union's side, but Olson and Jasinski say they did notfor good reason.  "The 18th North Carolina was looking to the southeast, directly toward the rising moon," they said. It stood at "25 degrees above the horizon" at the time, just at the wrong angle.  "The bright moon would've silhouetted Jackson and his officers, completely obscuring their identities."  The Confederate infantrymen likely thought their own men returning were Union cavalrymen on the approach.  "Our astronomical analysis partially absolves the 18th North Carolina from blame for the wounding of Jackson," Olson says.  It comes too late for the man who gave the order to fire.  Maj. John D. Barry died at age 27 just two years after the end of the war.  "His family believed his death was a result of the depression and guilt he suffered as a consequence of having given the order to fire," the Virginia Military Institute site says.  Stonewall Jackson may have appreciated the Texas State researchers' hypothesis, not only because it would have alleviated the conscience of the men who took his life.  Before joining the Confederate Army, he was a science professor.  
 A mortar landed near the Russian Embassy in the Syrian capital of Damascus on Thursday, killing a Syrian civilian and injuring nine Syrian security personnel who work for the diplomatic post, Russia's foreign ministry said.  No Russians were hurt in the attack, according to the ministry, which said it was trying to determine who launched the shell.  The United States condemned the shelling.  "The United States continues to emphasize that those responsible for atrocities on all sides must be held accountable," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.  The death was one of dozens reported Thursday throughout Syria, plagued by civil war.  State-run media reported that the regime's army recaptured the city of Deir Attiya from opposition militants on Thursday. The army killed an unspecified number of militants who earlier this month had taken the city, about 50 miles northeast of Damascus, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported.  The opposition group Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported at least 55 people were killed Thursday, including 20 in Damascus and its suburbs and 10 in Raqqa.  Raqqa, in northern Syria, is where a regime-fired Scud missile hit a market a day earlier, killing about 35 people and wounding dozens of others, according to the main opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Coalition.  The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement. It is now a full-blown civil war.  The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict, and 9 million have been displaced.  Syria plans to send a delegation to Switzerland early next year to participate in peace talks, but the opposition Free Syrian Army says it will pass. The United Nations announced that the often-delayed Geneva II conference aimed at ending the Syrian civil war starts January 22 in Geneva.  Geneva II is a successor to Geneva I, a June 2012 meeting in which international parties laid out a peace plan for Syria that calls for a transitional governing body. It left open the question of whether President Bashar al-Assad must leave power.  The United States and Russia announced in May that they would try to bring the warring parties to a second conference in Geneva to implement the plan. But the second Geneva conference has been delayed several times.

Okaloosa Island, Florida Vacationers were the first to notice the bird fumbling in the water near this popular tourist beach last week. It bobbed and swayed differently than other birds, and didn't react when humans came dangerously close. Once it was ashore, they could see why: a light sheen of oil covered its feathers.  Animal health technician Stephanie Neumann tried to rescue the Northern Gannet, but beach safety officers stopped her. Her coworkers at the Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge already had stabilized birds and a sea turtle affected by the Gulf oil disaster, but officials wanted to know: Did she have a contract with BP? Could sheand the bird --wait while they verified her organization's status?  "They're trying to do their job," Neumann said as she crouched over the motionless bird, wrapped in a white sheet and barely hidden from the stares of kids and parents. "They have to make sure protocol is followed."  When brown clumps of tar began to wash up on the snow-white beaches around Destin last week, the mood in this sunny beach community shifted from optimistic denial to furious worry. Local ideas about how to protect the area clashed with plans from BP, state and federal agencies. Community volunteers struggling to cut through protocol cheered a decision by Okaloosa County to defy BP and the feds. They were done waiting. They'd use their own plans.  "This is ridiculous. We'll take the heat. We would do whatever it took to stop the oil," said the county commission chairman, Wayne Harris.  After months of wrangling with agencies responding to the spill, Harris wasn't willing to stake the county's ecology and economy only on boom that captures or absorbs oil. The commission authorized emergency management teams to add skimmers, barges and extra boom, and an air wall they hope will push the oil away. They plan to layer prevention measures in the pass that connects the Gulf to Choctawhatchee Bay, where fresh and salt water mix and dolphins play. Harris said the plan could cost up to $6 million per month, which he hopes will be covered by money from BP.  The county developed its oil plan in the days after the disaster began to unfold, but it was plagued by miscommunications, disagreements and bureaucracy once it left local hands, Harris said.  Communities along the Gulf Coast have made similar complaints. Mayors grilled a BP official about the response during a press conference earlier this month. In Magnolia Springs, Alabama, locals went outside the federal plan and risked incarceration by adding boom and barges to protect Weeks Bay. In Pointe Aux Chenes, Louisiana, Native Americans pitched in to string boom near an island where many of their ancestors are buried.  Harris said some of his county's efforts may work; others may not. "Doing something is better than doing nothing," he said.  On the Okaloosa Island beach, local response to the oiled Gannet was quicker, but the federal response had less red tape to work through. U.S. Fish and Wildlife workers arrived before Neumann's status was verified, so she left their bird in their care.  "Time is essential with these guys," she said. "Every minute counts."  For the rest of Okaloosa County, more boom and barges were starting to appear in the water. The county commission vote was "smart," and sped up the state and federal response, said public safety director Dino Villani, who was quickly invited to an "olive branch" meeting in Mobile. Most of the county's preferred plans are moving forward, Villani said, and they'll continue to adapt as the oil moves throughout their waters.  Harris said the plans would have gone forward even without approval from BP or other government agencies.  "I'm sure they're cussing. I'm sure they're cussing us bad," Harris said. "If we had waited, we'd still be waiting. Why did it take us giving an ultimatum?"  Charles Diorio, a Coast Guard commander in Mobile, said some communities decided to implement their own plans once they saw they didn't top the list of state and federal priorities, if they were on the list at all. Some just wanted to act before the messand response agencies' attentionbegan to move their way.  Now that oil is reaching Florida's shores, resources are shifting there, Diorio said, and there's a plan to meet with Okaloosa commissioners this week.  "Now is the time to make sure these relationships are still working and strong and the lines of communication are open," he said.  The commission's vote marked a turning point for Okaloosa County residents and vacationers. Even as oil crippled fishing, tourism and ecology in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, wishful thinkers hoped for the best around Destin, which calls itself the "World's Luckiest Fishing Village."  "I'm guilty of it. Every day something doesn't happen, you walk down your beach and don't see it, the feeling gets strongeruntil it arrives," Okaloosa County's beach safety division chief Tracey Vause said as he picked gummy tar balls from the sand.  "I was infuriated. It's almost like grieving. This is the destination, white, sandy beaches. Now they're not."  June is typically a busy month along the area known as Florida's Emerald Coast. Beaches in Destin and Fort Walton are usually packed with families freed from school and work, and the water is crammed with boats. But when traces of oil actually arrived last week, clean-up crews were on land and familiar local fishermen wore life jackets, a tell-tale sign they were called into service for BP. Tourist rentals already were down as much as 50 percent, county officials said. Shops were quiet, service jobs were cut back and only a few umbrellas and towels were scattered across the soft sand.  No oil-related illnesses or injuries had been reported as of late last week, said Cecilia Wagner, a community health worker for Okaloosa County. A health advisory warned beachgoers against swimming one day last week, but it was lifted hours later.  The arrival of oil spooked residents, and made clear the conflicts between local action and BP's response.  On the boardwalk at Okaloosa Island, volunteers cleaned up after a group of campers made oil-absorbing boom from hosiery and animal hair. Boom makers Yente Sehman and Barbara Johnson said they'd prefer boom made with renewable resources in the water around Okaloosa County's beaches, and as oil came closer, more materials and volunteers had showed up to help their efforts.  In a warehouse nearby, the pair stacked human and animal hair donations funneled through the non-profit Matter of Trust and postmarked from Missouri, Georgia, Massachusetts, Australia and China. Volunteers packed dog and alpaca hair clippings into the legs of pantyhose, then tied them off and strung them into mesh casings with plastic pieces that float in the water. Already, more than 5,000 boom were stacked inside the warehouse.  County officials said they don't want to discourage volunteers, but they aren't planning to use the animal hair boom, except as a last resort. Sehman's phone was busy with calls from local business owners and real estate agents who wanted the boom to protect their businesses, but organizers can't give the boom away without county approval and a clear plan for its disposal.  "We live in paradise and everybody wants to believe it's not going to happen to us," Johnson said. "It's turning into anger and frustration. BP, local government, state government, everybody sitting around waiting for someone else to do something. We want to help, but we can't."  Still, the women said they won't stop their boom-making effort, especially as more community members notice the empty beaches studded with tar balls and look for ways to get involved.  "Once we started, no way," Sehman said. "I'm very proud to live in this county at this point in time. People of this county are going to do what they want to do."  
 Madrid A court in Spain on Friday dropped the most serious charge facing Princess Cristina, a sister of King Felipe VI, raising the possibility that she could avoid a court trial in a financial scandal.  The Provincial Court in Palma de Mallorca threw out a charge of money laundering but allowed two charges of tax fraud to stand, according to the court order.  It was not immediately clear whether the alleged crimes, as charged, would mean a trial for the princess. A magistrate who has been investigating the financial scandal for several years will have to determine whether to do so, an official at the court told CNN.  A court trial of a member of the Spanish royal family would be unprecedented.  The case centers on the nonprofit Noos foundation, which received millions of dollars in government contracts to stage sports and tourism events.  The magistrate, Judge Jose Castro, investigated whether part of that money may have been diverted for private use by the princess and her husband, Inaki de Urdangarin, who is also charged. Through their legal teams, both have denied any wrongdoing.  Before the three-judge panel issued its 160-page ruling Fridayin response to appeals by various parties to the casethe court official, by custom not identified, had told CNN that the princess almost certainly would have faced trial if the court had upheld all three charges against her.  But since only the two counts of alleged tax fraud still stand, Castro must decide whether to apply a legal precedent in Spain that if the state prosecutor wasn't pressing charges for tax fraud, which is the situation for the princess, then no trial would be held.  A small union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, is alone in pressing the tax fraud charges against her, as a kind of private prosecution, permitted in Spain.  The Supreme Court previously ruled in a separate case that a private charge alone was not strong enough to force a tax fraud trial.  Urdangarin and some 15 other defendants who are charged in the case are expected to face trial, the court official said. The judge has not set a trial date yet.

Juventus became the first Italian club to reach 100 points in the league after comfortably defeating Cagliari 3-0 in their final Serie A match of the season.  The Old Lady of Turn had already secured their third scudetto in a row but goals from Fernando Llorente, Claudio Marchisio and an own goal by Cagliari goalkeeper Marco Silvestri, from a stunning Andrea Pirlo free kick that hit the post and bounced in off Silvestri, ensured that Juve finished on a record 102 points.  It has been a chaotic season of football in Italy, marred by fan violence, racism and continued failure in the UEFA Champions League.  Earlier this month the Italian Cup Final was delayed after three Napoli fans were shot before the game, causing Napoli's ultras to riot and throw flares on to the pitch.  But, domestically at least, Juve has been devastatingly consistent with a season of records for Antonio Conte's side.  The victory ensured that they maintained a 100 percent record of home victories throughout the season, winning 33 of their 38 games and finishing an incredible 17 points clear of their nearest rivals Roma.  "I want to say a massive thank you to all the players, every one of them has been phenomenal," Conte told Sky Sports Italia after the match. "Our objective was to win a third consecutive scudetto, instead we've set record after record."  Incredibly, given Conte's success since taking charge of Juventus, his position has been in some doubt with rumors suggesting he was Monaco bound.  "Tonight the appointment is to celebrate the title," Conte said when asked about his future. "My appointment with the club will come later."  
 When you look to buy airline tickets later this week, it might seem like prices have shot up. For once, that's not actually the case.  Higher advertised fares are the result of new Department of Transportation rules that are going into effect under the banner "Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections #2."  Higher prices shown up front is one of the four main changes that you'll see when the the new rules go into effect starting Tuesday, so let's talk about what will happen.  Full fare advertising  On some airline websites and in ads, you've probably seen fares displayed as a certain amount plus taxes and fees. That's a pretty common thing throughout society, but the DOT has decided that it's unacceptable for airline travelers. Beginning Thursday, the advertised price has to be the total price including any mandatory per passenger taxes and fees.  Let's say that there's a sale for $59 each way between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Now, the airline can advertise it as $59 each way plus taxes and fees. On Thursday, it will have to be shown as $69.80 each way. This applies to advertisements, but more importantly, it applies to reservation websites. They can no longer show just the base fare in the search results.  This may seem a little strange since it's not the case in other industries. Hotels still show base rate before taxes and fees, for example. But this is how the DOT wants the airline industry to work.  Wondering what exactly is included in this new fare? Fuel surcharges must be included in the rate (as has been the case for years anyway) and any mandatory fees. Of course, most of the fees people see adding up today are optional fees, like baggage charges, and those can still be broken out. There are, however, a slew of regulations impacting them as well.  Fees become more prominent and standardized  The DOT has decided to regulate optional fee disclosure to make pricing clearer, but unfortunately, the new rules might end up doing the exact opposite.  A couple of things make good sense. If there is a change in bag fees or baggage allowances, the airlines must prominently display a link to the change on their homepages for at least three months. Airlines will also have to make available a complete list of rates for all optional services, from pillows to food and drinks.   While airlines have to get into specifics for bag fees, the rest can be listed in ranges of fees, making the information somewhat less useful. These changes sound good, but then the DOT steps up disclosure where it might hit the point of overload.  Under the new rules, anytime a fare quote is given, airlines have to let passengers know that "bag fees may apply."In addition, when a ticket is purchased, the airline must include in the e-ticket receipt, a complete list of all possible bag fees and allowances.  That means detailing different rules for elite frequent fliers, different rules by class of service, etc. If you're wondering where they'll put it, it will undoubtedly go into the fine print at the bottom that nobody reads anyway because there are already too many disclosures down there.  One actual victory for travelers here centers around which bag fees get charged when a traveler is booked on codesharing airlines for trips beginning or ending in the U.S. Today, if you buy a ticket on, say, American, but your first flight is on its codeshare partner Etihad, then the baggage rules on Etihad usually apply.   The new rule means that the policies of the marketing airline, in this case American, apply regardless of who is operating the flight. That sounds good, but in practice it's going to be very difficult to implement and enforce.  No more opt-out  If you've ever bought a ticket from an ultra low-cost airline like Allegiant or Spirit, you might have found yourself frustrated by the dreaded "opt-out" procedure. You know how it works. The travel insurance or some other optional service might be automatically checked. If you don't want it, you have to uncheck it before you continue or it will be charged. This rule makes that illegal going forward. All optional services will be "opt-in" only.  No price increases after you buy  This might sound silly, but fares can no longer be increased after tickets have been purchased. Has this been a problem? No. But it does prevent Allegiant from doing something that travelers might have liked.  Allegiant had discussed the idea of giving travelers the choice of two fares. One would be higher, but would not change. The other would be lower, but would go up if the price of fuel went up. So it would simply tie a piece of the fare to the cost of fuel. If people wanted to take a gamble on fuel prices, they could buy the lower fares. That, however, is no longer an option. But it really is minor since the option wasn't yet offered anyway.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brett Snyder.

Twitter was abuzz Thursday with the death of Apple visionary Steve Jobs but another topic was gathering steam as the day progressed. Who will win this year's coveted Nobel Peace Prize?  Not Jobs, though many among his huge global following posted messages that he should. The Nobel is never awarded posthumously and that rule also eliminates Mohamed Bouazizi, the unemployed college graduate whose self-immolation in Tunisia sparked a popular uprising that led to the fall of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali's government. The Tunisian revolt began this year's so-called Arab Spring.  Some years, there are clear frontrunnersMartin Luther King, Jr., Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi.  This year, it's anyone's guess with a record number of nominations241received by the Nobel committee. Of those, 53 are organizations, including WikiLeaksthe website founded by Julian Assange that facilitates the publication of classified information and made headlines for leaking documents and videos related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also released thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables.  "Liu Xiabao was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his struggle for human rights, democracy and freedom of speech in China," blogged Norwegian lawmaker Snorre Valen of the Socialist Left Party, who nominated WikiLeaks. "Likewise: WikiLeaks have contributed to the struggle for those very values globally, by exposing (among many other things) corruption, war crimes and torturesome times even conducted by allies of Norway."  Liu's win upset the Chinese and set off a diplomatic squabble. The year before, the world gasped collectively at Barack Obama's win, a shocker that the U.S. president had won even before he had completed his first year in office.  Despite the controversy that has swirled around perhaps the world's most prestigious prize, some experts say this year is a no-brainer, given the seismic events that have gripped the Arab world.  Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of Norway's Peace Research Institute Oslo shortlisted men and women who did their share in fomenting peaceful revolts against repressive regimes.  Harpviken's top choice is Israa Abdel Fattah, who helped organize Egypt's online April 6 Youth Movement in 2008.  She was arrested by Egyptian security that year and soon became a symbol of defiance against Hosni Mubarak's government. She has earned the monikers "cyber dissident" and "Facebook girl" and was named one of Arabian Business Magazine's 100 most powerful women in 2011.  The peace research institute's website said that Fattah is a good choice because the Nobel committee "has emphasized its wish to be relevant, to speak to dominant themes of the present, and to see the prize giving leverage in unfolding processes. Secondly, Harpviken believes that the prize is likely to be awarded to a female leader or activist who has been an innovator of new tools for bringing about peace."  Another potential winner is Wael Ghonim, the former Google executive who used social media to jump-start social change in Egypt. Ghonim fired off a steady stream of messages on Twitter and Facebook and worked behind the scenes to galvanize thousands to march on the streets to demand change.  Tunisian blogger Lina Ben Mhenni is also on many top lists. Censored in her own country, she criticized the regime long before the uprisings began, dispersing information to the outside world.  "A prize to Mhenni would be a prize to independent reporting, in the form of social media, as well as recognition of the peaceful protests of the Tunisian people at large," the peace institute website said.  Some experts think that Gene Sharp, an American scholar who founded the Albert Einstein Institution in Boston, could be recognized for his work on the principles of non-violence, including "From Dictatorship to Democracy." The downloadable writings in many languages have proved a source of inspiration around the world, including the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa.  Harpviken also named Memorial, a Russian civil rights group known for its fight for to protect refugees and victims of political persecution and human rights violations in war zones.  Natalya Estemirova, Memorial's lead researcher in the Chechen republic, was abducted and killed in July 2009. Human Rights Watch said it "appeared to be clearly connected to her work uncovering human rights violations in Chechnya. "  Bookmakers Paddy Power listed Sima Samar, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, as a favorite at 5/4 odds.  A physician and trailblazer for women's rights, Samar was named deputy premier after the toppling of the Taliban in 2001, the first woman to win such a high government post.  She has been threatened with death and harassed for questioning conservative Islamic laws and practices, including the burqua, the head-to-toe garment Afghan women have been forced to wear.  Paddy Power picked the right winner last year. That bodes well for Samar. Other names on global shortlists include: Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese pro-democracy leader who was released from house arrest last year. Suu Kyi is already a Nobel laureateshe was awarded the peace price in 1991. No individual has won it twice, though two organizationsthe International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesare repeat winners. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Cuban dissident Oswaldo Payas Sardinas Ghazi bin Muhammad, a Jordanian advocate of interfaith dialogue  The winner will be announced Friday. Until then, the speculation continues to heat up.  Twitter user Alu Abunimah (@avinunu) offered one last candidate for consideration to his more than 16,000 followers.  "Maybe the Nobel Peace Prize will go to The Markets, to help Calm them and make them Feel Better," he said. "Also they need the money."  The Nobel Peace prize laureate will win about $1.5 million.

 JOHANNESBURG, South Africa Police armed with rubber bullets were patrolling neighborhoods in Johannesburg on Tuesday in an effort to quell a recent spree of violence aimed at foreigners that police say has killed 22 people and displaced an estimated 13,000.  A crowd armed with clubs, machetes and axes rioted on the outskirts of Johannesburg on Tuesday.  Many of the victims are Zimbabweans who have fled repression and dire economic circumstances in their homeland.  Evidence of the violence was seen in smoke rising from burned homes in one Johannesburg neighborhood. Locals angry about the rising number of foreigners arriving in South Africa had set homes ablaze.  Firefighters said they had fought more than 100 such blazes since Thursday.  Standing outside a row of charred homes, Diamond Minnaar said there is a solution for foreigners.  "Most of them just have to go back to their country and leave us in peace," Minnaar said. "That is the only solution. Or they are just going to get killed. Look at how many shacks have burnt down."  The attacks and looting have drawn condemnation from South African officials and other African leaders. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video  The violence began a week ago in Johannesburg's Alexandra Township, police say, and has been concentrated in the city's poorest areas.  "People are angry because they are unemployed, poverty-affected people struggling for basic needs every day," said Dean Christopher Barends, a local Lutheran minister. "This will explode into something."  One person victimized was Pascoal Sendela Gulane, a Mozambican man, who said gangs broke into his home and stole his belongings.  He fled to a church with his family and is now living with his children in his car on the church's property. For him and many others, churches and police stations have become safe havens.  Watch footage of the attacks   On Monday, South African President Thabo Mbeki called for an end to the violence.  "We dehumanize ourselves the moment we start thinking of another person as less human than we are simply because they come from another country" he said in a statement.  "As South Africans, we must recognize and fully appreciate that we are bound together with other Africans by history, culture, economics and, above all, by destiny. I call upon those behind these shameful and criminal acts to stop! Nothing can justify it."  He has called for an investigation into the violence.  Also Monday, the Nelson Mandela Foundation issued a statement condemning the "senseless violence."  South African police have arrested more than 200 people in connection with the violence for offenses including rape, murder, robbery and theft.  Police director Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said that at least one foreigner was burned alive over the weekend, while others saw their houses torched, their shops looted and their possessions stolen.  Tuesday there was a large police presence in the neighborhoods were the violence had occurred, according to a CNN producer on the scene.  Despite the police presence, sporadic looting still took place in several townships east of Johannesburg.  Mbuso Mthembu, provincial manager at the Red Cross office in Johannesburg, said that the number of people fleeing is continuing to grow and that violent attacks seem to be spreading into other areas.  His organization has made an emergency appeal for people to donate 1 million rand (about $135,000) to help support the estimated 13,000 who have fled their homes. Many had to flee quickly, leaving all their belongings behind, Mthembu said.  "We have delivered blankets, kids clothing, baby formula," he said. "But we need more."

In a town not far from me, a municipal ballot measure has become a national bellwether. The citizens of SeaTac, a working-class community that includes the major airport for the Seattle-Tacoma area, will vote next month on whether to establish a $15 minimum wage for hospitality and transportation workers.  This is obviously a fight about economics (a recent report (PDF) finds that those workers make an average wage of $11 today). Perhaps less obviously, it's also a fight about citizenship.  The pro-Proposition 1 campaign is part of a resurgence of worker organizing across the country. Fast-food strikes have hit dozens of cities; autoworkers are unionizing in the low-wage South; fiercely independent lobstermen in Maine have already unionized. Labor organizers in SeaTac want to ride this wave.  At the same time, the opposition is strong and well-funded and has the advantage of inertia. The airlines and hotel chains opposed to Proposition 1 need only to sow uncertainty and fear about unintended consequencesthe fear, specifically, of the layoffs or cuts in hours that might result if labor costs went up (and, implicitly, of course, if corporate profits remained untouched).  But SeaTac is a town with fewer than 12,000 voters, with many immigrant families and with shops and restaurants where "everybody knows your name." Generic talking points and a vague invocation of fear or hope won't cut it here.  Every voter's door in SeaTac can be knocked on more than once, and will be. Which is why SEIU 775NW, the local union that helped put Proposition 1 on the ballot, is investing heavily in feet on the street and face-to-face persuasion.  What's notable in SeaTac, though, is that the people who live here are not pawns in anyone's game. For over three decades, workers in the United States found that as their economic fortunes declined, so did their civic clout.  Now, everyday citizens in and around SeaTac who have endured constant economic insecurity are finding their voice and learning to ask in public whether they should accept as normal a life where working multiple jobs still can't push a family out of poverty.  Last week, I heard one of these newly activated citizens. Evelyn Olano is a 51-year-old Filipina immigrant. She works two low-wage jobs at the airport, scanning bags and doing security seven days a week. Her husband, already past retirement age, cleans hotel rooms.  Five or 10 years ago, Evelyn and every baggage handler and bathroom cleaner and car rental gatekeeper at SeaTac would have silently borne their lot. Today, they are not. They are becoming literate in the language of civic action and political power.  As I watched Evelyn give a speech at a campaign event, it was very clear that she'd never done this beforeand that she'd be doing it again. Evelyn spoke of the dollars and cents difference Proposition 1 would make in her household. But her earnest presence testified just as powerfully to the democratic difference it would make.  The economic rationale for a minimum wage hike is that it creates a virtuous cycle of increasing demand: When workers have more money, businesses have more customers, which means businesses hire more workers, which in turn generates more customers. Customer creation begets job creation, from the middle out and bottom up.  The civic rationale for a minimum wage hike is similarly demand-driven. When more citizens demand economic fairness, powerful institutions become more responsive, which empowers more citizens to find their voice, which in turn leads our leaders to listen more to citizens. It's citizen creation, from the middle out and bottom up.  The fight in SeaTac is evidence that the surest way to address economic inequality is to address political inequality: by organizing, speaking up and rounding up the votes to redefine what's considered normal in public policy.  Indeed, even if Proposition 1 doesn't pass, it's already expanded the "safe zone" in regional politics: Both candidates for mayor in nearby Seattle have now pledged to raise their city's minimum wage to $15, a move that will have wide national reverberations.  This era of economic upheaval nationwide and policy paralysis in Washington is leading citizens across the spectrum to rediscover the power of collective action. The tea party has showed vividly that an activated, well-organized minority, working together, can change the frame of what's possible in politics. Now, it's time for workers stuck in poverty to learn and apply that lesson. They may get a living wage. They will certainly get a healthier democracy.  
 Google has made a bold statement against discrimination on its home page.  The search giant's rainbow Olympic-themed logo, posted to mark the first day of the Sochi Winter Games, sends a powerful message of support for not only gay athletes competing in the games, but for the gay community at large and its supporters.  The company often changes its logo to reflect current events or to mark significant anniversaries. The latest "Google doodle" features images of athletes involved in Winter Olympic events, against a backdrop colored like the rainbow flag, the adopted symbol of the movement for gay rights.  Unlike the current iteration, Google doodles usually conform to the company logo's color scheme.  Under the search bar, the company quotes the Olympic Charter, which promises all athletes the right to practice sport.  "The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play," the Charter excerpt reads.  The quoted paragraph is the fourth in the Charter's "fundamental principles of Olympism" (pdf).  The colored logo is a direct rebuke to Russian president Vladimir Putin's government, whose recently-introduced anti-gay legislation, the so-called anti-gay propaganda law, has been a focal point of critics of these Games. Opponents argue that the laws that Putin's government enacted last year are in contravention to the spirit of the Games.  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, recently warned both spectators and athletes against promoting gay rights during the Olympics. Last month Anatoly Pakhomov, the Mayor of Sochi, drew ridicule by suggesting that the city was devoid of gay people.  Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, used his speech to the International Olympic Committee on Thursday to offer support to the LGBT community, saying that "many professional athletes, gay and straight, are speaking out against prejudice."  Google's undisputed position as the world's most-used search engine means that this is a rebuke that may be seen by billions.  The Sochi Winter Olympics officially open today and will run until the 23rd of February.

ATLANTA, Georgia Health and Human Services' acting secretary has appointed Dr. Richard Besser as the interim director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  William Gimson will  return to his position as the CDC's chief operating officer.  He replaces William Gimson, who took over as interim CDC director at noon on January 20.  Gimson notified CDC employees that HHS acting secretary Charles E. Johnson had announced the appointment.  Gimson replaced Dr. Julie Gerberding, who was the head of the CDC from 2002 until two days ago.  Gerberding, along with other senior officials, also resigned on January 20, when Barack Obama and his administration took over.  Past HHS secretary Michael Leavitt said that the interim directors would take over until the next HHS nomineeformer Sen. Tom Daschleis confirmed and makes the permanent appointments.  Gimson told employees he's returning to his post as the CDC's chief operating officer. The CDC usually has a physician as its director, which Gimson is not.  According to the biography posted on the CDC Web site, Besser's last position at the CDC was as the director of the Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response, where he was responsible for public health emergency preparedness and emergency response activities.  According to CDC sources, Besser was seeing patients when he learned of his new position. In addition to heading the CDC bioterrorism preparedness division, he is a practicing pediatrician.  
 As an estimated one billion people around the globe take part in events to mark the 42nd Earth Day, Paolo Nespoli's images provide a striking reminder of our planet's awe-inspiring beauty and fragility as an eco-system.  During a six-month mission to the International Space Station (ISS) last year, the Italian astronaut snapped around 26,000 images, posting daily updates on Twitter.  "I really tried to capture what I was seeing. I was amazed by the response from people. It was very fulfilling for me. I was doing something which was very interesting for me, but it made me more happy that I could share the images," Nespoli said.  Nespoli explained to CNN what it's like to see the world "turning around your feet" and the unique perspective space travel provides on our planet and humans' collective impact on it.  Describe the view of Earth from space?  Paolo Nespoli: "It's a most unreal view you have from up there. It's look as though it's painted. One of the things you gain up there is an appreciation of planet Earth as a kind of ship. It looks like a ship flying in space.  "A lot of the time you're up there you are working so you don't have a lot of time to look out of the window. When you do, most of the time you see oceans and cloudswhich is really nice.  "But it really takes a little bit of time before you acquire a perception of where you are and what you are looking at and how to look at it in the best way.  "After a month, a month and a half, something strange happensyou look out of the window and you know where you are. You might be over Australia, Africa, you just know. It's amazing how you just develop this."  How high does the ISS orbit?  PN: We are 400 kilometers (248 miles) above the Earth and fly at a velocity of 20,000 kilometers-per-hour (12,400 mph)the equivalent of about 7.7 kilometers-per-second (4.8 miles-per-second).  How did traveling to space change your outlook on Earth?  PN: "I felt like a human being, a terrestrial guynot an Italian or a European. I felt like an earthling.  "You get an appreciation of how delicate the planet is. You see the atmosphere which covers the Earth like a blanket. It looked like if I would blow on it too hard it would float away. We know if that get's corrupted in a certain way that's the end."  How do you think humans are affecting the planet?  PN: "The impact we are having on this planet is surely microscopic when we look at one single event, but when you look at it and you repeat these events all over - a few miles across here, a few miles across there, a river here, a river there, a city here, a city thereand it's clear we are a major force in shaping the crust of this planet and its clear we have the capability of imparting changes.  "I cannot say we are bad, or that we are causing the planet to go hot or cold. We don't have enough data. But it's clear that we are doing things that have a huge potential of making changes. We need to understand more. It's a risky situation with a very delicate eco-system balance which can be dramatically skewed."  Thoughts on the future of space travel?  PN: "I think space travel will become successful as a tourism activity. I wish everybody could go up there and see the world from a different point of view, with different eyes.  "I would, for sure, send up the politicians (some of them we should leave there!) to change the way they think, but I would also send up philosophers, journalists and theologians."

KABUL, Afghanistan Afghanistan's opium production dropped dramatically this year partly because of new aggressive drug-fighting tactics in the country, a United Nations study found.  Afghan police officers use tractors to destroy poppy crops in Helmand province earlier this year.  According to the report from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, production dipped by 10 percent this year, while cultivation fell by 22 percent.  "At a time of pessimism about the situation in Afghanistan, these results are a welcome piece of good news and demonstrate that progress is possible," said Antonio Maria Costa, the office's executive director.  The United Nations notes that drugs originating in Afghanistan have "catastrophic consequences."  "They fund the activities of criminals, insurgents and terrorists in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Collusion with corrupt government officials is undermining public trust, security and the rule of law.  "Widespread money-laundering is harming the reputation of banks in the Gulf and farther afield," it said. Watch U.N. official discuss concerns about opium stockpiles   The report, released this week, attributed the decrease to better government leadership, aggressive counter-narcotics tactics, a push for farmers to grow legal crops and pressure from NATO-led soldiers.  This was the second year that the production of the opium, used to produce heroin, had dropped in Afghanistan. The study found 20 of the 34 provinces in Afghanistan were now free of opium farming.  The most significant drop this year was in Helmand province, the volatile southern region where NATO-led forces are battling with militants. In that opium hotbed, cultivation dipped from 103,590 to 69,833 hectares (255,976 to 172,561 acres).  But even with this seemingly good news, some fear that drug traffickers in Afghanistan are preparing to fight back. According to the report, researchers found evidence strong drug cartels, similar to ones seen in Colombia, were being formed by participants in Afghanistan's drug trade.  "A marriage of convenience between insurgents and criminal groups is spawning narco-cartels linked to the Taliban," Costa said.  Incentive programs giving local farmers seeds and training in growing legal crops represent a key tactic in the fight against drugs.  Local farmers in Helmand are being trained at a facility ran by the U.S. Agency for International Development.  Farmers like Abdul Qadir said programs like this one are key to bringing peace to war-torn Afghanistan.  "These countries that are here, why are they with guns and bombs? If you can just help the people of Afghanistan in this way, the fighting will go away, these Taliban and other enemies of the country will also disappear," Qadir said.  CNN's Atia Abawi contributed to this report.  
 At a modest stucco home in Montgomery, Alabama, an unlikely presidential victory celebration is taking place this morning.  Barack Obama's election victory represents a triumph for civil rights activists before him.  Peggy Wallace Kennedy, the daughter of the late George Wallace, the Alabama governor who once vowed to maintain segregation forever, is rejoicing.  Kennedy, 58, voted for Sen. Barack Obama. She says she was "mesmerized" when she first heard him speak at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Her admiration for Obama deepened when she learned he opposed the Iraq war. She even slapped an Obama bumper sticker on her car, even though someone told her that the prospect of an African-American president would have her father "rolling over in his grave."  "I think Obama is going to be one of the best presidents we'll have," she says. "He's going to bring the freshness we need. We've just been bogged down so long. We need this shot in the arm."  Watch Obama address supporters after his win   President-elect Obama's victory Tuesday may be a racially transformative event. But for people like Kennedy, who came through the fires of the civil rights movement, it also represents something elsepersonal triumph. Obama's win validates the risks they took years ago. iReport.com: What does Obama's victory mean to you?  Some, like Kennedy and an entire generation of white Southerners, risked social rejection for renouncing the bigotry of their parents. Others risked their lives while leading civil rights campaigns in the Deep South. Some almost lost their belief in the inherent goodness of America because they saw so many innocent people die. iReport.com: 'This is the most wonderful night of my life'  They are people like Bob Moses, who led African-American voter registration drives in Mississippi during the early 1960s. He was a leader in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Mississippi when three civil rights workers were murdered by a group of men that included a Mississippi deputy sheriff. He also helped lead an ill-fated attempt to sit African-American delegates from Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, which was segregated.  Moses grew so disenchanted by his experiences that he moved to Tanzania. He returned to the United States in 1976 and founded the Algebra Project, a national program that encourages African-American students to attend college by first teaching them mathematical literacy.  "We seem to be evolving..., " Moses says. "The country is trying to reach for the best part of itself."  Moses is evolving as well. Obama is the first president he's voted for in three decades, he says.  "I don't do politics, but I made sure to vote this time," says Moses, now 73 years old. "Obama is the first person I really felt moved to vote for."  Moses says he is amazed that Obama has helped lead the country through a racially transformative moment without anyone getting killed.  Pivotal events in America's racial historythe debate over slavery, the assault on segregationsparked widespread violence, Moses says.  "I don't think people appreciate how delicate it is to move the society around these questions without descent into chaos or into pockets of chaos," he says.  Obama's victory also offered a rare public acknowledgement for Moses. He recently attended an Obama rally when Obamaa keen student of the civil rights movementdiscovered he was in the audience.  "When he got on the platform, he gave me a shout out," says Moses, whose reluctance to be in the spotlight was notorious among his civil rights colleagues. "He said, 'there's someone in the audience, and he's a hero of mine.' "  Moses paused when asked how it felt.  "It was good."  The nation goes full circle  Obama's victory, though, wasn't just made possible by civil rights activists, some say. It was also made possible by a generation of African-American leaders who excelled in the political, sports and entertainment arenas: former Secretary of State Colin Powell, golfer Tiger Woods and pop culture figures like actor Bill Cosby and Dennis Haysbert, who portrays a black president in the television series "24."  Watch Powell discuss his reaction to Obama's win   They didn't change laws, but they did shift perceptions, some say.  "We live in a society where white voters are prepared and accustomed to seeing African-Americans in prominent positions and leadership," says Brett Gadsden, an assistant professor of African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.  The Rev. James Zwerg almost lost his life trying to usher in this new society.  Zwerg, who is white, participated in the Freedom Rides in the early 1960s, and he says Obama's victory means the country has gone "full-circle."  Zwerg was almost beaten to death by a white mob in 1961 when he dared to sit next to African-Americans on a Greyhound bus. He was part of a group of white and black college students, dubbed "Freedom Riders," who tried to desegregate interstate travel.  The photos of a bloodied Zwerg, standing next to a battered John Lewiswho would go on to become a Georgia congressman --rallied activists across the nation. Zwerg became a civil rights hero, but his father disowned him for protesting alongside African-Americans.  Watch Lewis celebrate Obama's victory   Yet Zwerg became so tormented by the attention he receivedhe thought he got too much credit because he was whitethat he once contemplated suicide.  Zwerg, 68, says the bond he experienced with other Freedom Riders caused the most inspiring moments of his life. Obama's campaign reminded him of that era.  "Obama's message reflects much of the same idealism that [the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.] spoke of when he talked about coming together to improve our country," Zwerg says. "He's really rekindled the same enthusiasm for change among young people, which is terrific."  Zwerg says he never thought back then that an African-American would integrate the Oval Officenor did any Freedom Rider.  "I don't think it really crossed our mind."  Clayborne Carson, a former activist and now a Stanford University historian, remembers getting arrested in 1965 just because he demanded the right to vote. He says it was "inconceivable" then that the United States would elect an African-American president.  "I remember how it was still a controversial act for President [Lyndon] Johnson to even select a black person for his Cabinet," Carson says.  Carson says many people forget that many African-Americans in the South were not allowed to vote until the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, a law passed only after the bloody civil rights campaign in Selma, Alabama, mobilized public opinion.  "America was a democracy in name only," Carson says. "It's only since the mid-1960s that we've had this experiment in a multicultural and multiracial democracy."  Carson says he sees the future of this multicultural experiment not only in Obama's victory, but also in his Stanford classroom. More than half of his students are not native white Americans but Asians, Latinos and African-Americans, he says.  He also sees a troubling future for the United States in his travels to counties like India and China. Those countries have highly educated youths who "have the sense that the future belongs to them."  "I don't know if we have that confidence," he says. "This symbolic change in leadership won't mean anything unless a President Obama can mobilize the country for the long, hard struggle to keep up with the world."  Kennedy, George Wallace's daughter, is thinking more about the past these days. She wonders how her father would have regarded Obama's victory.  She says Wallace had his own racially transformative moment. He renounced bigotry later in his life, publicly apologized for the pain he caused and was elected to his last term as governor of Alabama with strong African-American support.  Still, she doesn't know what he would say about her vote for Obama.  "I think he would be all right with it," she says. "Daddy had come full circle. I really think that he would be happy about it or at least interested in it. I'm not sure he would have voted for Obama."  Obama's victory, however, doesn't mean the politics of exclusion that her father once practiced is history, she says.  "There's racism, and there always will be racism," she says. "But this country has come a long way."  When asked how she was going to celebrate Obama's win, Kennedy gave a mischievous chuckle. She says she's going to continue to do what she and her husband, H. Mark Kennedy, a retired Alabama Supreme Court justice, have been doing the last few days since an Obama victory seemed certain:  "We've been sitting here and watching Fox News go utterly berserk."

Arizona's attorney general proposed arming one principal or employee at each school to defend against attacks such as the recent Connecticut school massacre.  "The ideal solution would be to have an armed police officer in each school," Attorney General Tom Horne said in a news release Wednesday. But budget cuts have limited the number of Arizona schools with "school resource officers" on campus, he said.  The "next best solution," Horne said, "is to have one person in the school trained to handle firearms, to handle emergency situations, and possessing a firearm in a secure location."  A shooter, armed with a semiautomatic rifle and two other guns, on December 14 killed 26 peopleincluding six faculty members and 20 young studentsat Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown.  Horne compared the plan to the FAA's program adopted after the September 11, 2001, attacks to arm airline pilots.  A school would be invited to send the principal "or another designee" to "training in the use of firearms and how to handle emergencies such as that which occurred in Newtown," Horne's release said. Horne's office would oversee the free training with help from sheriffs, he said.  "The designated individual (no more than one per school) would then be authorized to keep a firearm locked in a secure place, and would have adequate communication to be alerted to an emergency in any part of the school," the release said.  Newspaper publishes names, addresses of gun permit holders  Several Arizona sheriffs have joined in to support the proposal, Horne said.  Legislation to allow it will be introduced by the Republican leader in the state House, he said.  "This proposal presents a golden mean between two extremes," Horne said. "One extreme is to allow all teachers to bring guns to school, which could create more dangers than it prevents. The other extreme is to do nothing, which everyone will regret if a preventable incident like Newtown would occur in the future."  CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.  
 Food kits recently distributed as part of a disaster relief effort in Kentucky and Arkansas may contain peanut butter contaminated with salmonella linked to a nationwide outbreak, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Wednesday.  People who received the food kits should throw away the peanut butter packets, FEMA says.  "Commercial meals kits manufactured by Red Cloud Food Services Inc., under the Standing Rock label, have been provided to disaster survivors in impacted communities, and these kits may contain peanut butter which is part of the precautionary national recall underway in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration," FEMA said in a written statement.  Though the kits do not all contain the same main course, they do contain packets of peanut butter, the agency said.  "People who have received commercial meal kits are asked to inspect the kits in their possession and immediately dispose of any peanut butter packets," it said.  Jay Blanton, spokesman for Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, said late Wednesday: "We just received this information from FEMA. Tonight, out of an abundance of caution, we are in the process of finding alternative sources of food for people in shelters. The Kentucky National Guard is starting to notify people who've already received the (meal kits) or might be getting one."  Blanton estimated that 6,000 to 7,000 people remained in shelters, primarily in western Kentucky.  Of officials' reactions to the salmonella warning, he said: "We're pretty resilient. We've had a lot thrown in our way and we're coming through it. FEMA has been working closely with us, and they assure us this is a precautionary measure."  The meals were sent in the wake of President Barack Obama's federal disaster declarations for Kentucky and Arkansas after they were hammered last week with rain, ice and snow.  No one at Red Cloud Food Services, based in South Elgin, Illinois, responded immediately to e-mails.  The meals were sent in the wake of President Barack Obama's federal disaster declarations for Kentucky and Arkansas after they were hammered last week with rain, ice and snow.  Last month, the Food and Drug Administration linked a nationwide outbreak of salmonella poisoning that has sickened more than 500 people and may have killed eight others to peanut butter and peanut paste produced by the Peanut Corporation of America at its plant in Blakely, Georgia.  FDA said PCA could have distributed contaminated product to more than 100 companies for use as an ingredient in hundreds of products, including cookies, crackers, cereal, candy and ice cream.  Federal authorities have initiated a criminal investigation into the company.  In a written statement, PCA said Wednesday that federal and state regulators took part last year in "regular visits and inspections of the Blakely facility."  "Independent audit and food safety firms also conducted customary unannounced inspections of the Blakely facility in 2008," it said. "One gave the plant an overall 'superior' rating, and the other rated the plant as 'Meet or Exceeds audit expectations (Acceptable-Excellent)' ratings. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the ongoing investigations, we will not be able to comment further about the facts related to this matter at this time."

WASHINGTON The 88-year-old white supremacist charged with killing a guard at the Holocaust Memorial Museum left a note proclaiming President Obama a tool of "Jew owners," according to court records released Thursday.  Writings attributed to James von Brunn and a biography appear on the Web site Holy Western Empire.  James von Brunn remained in critical condition in a Washington hospital after being shot by other security guards at the museum Wednesday.  A notebook found in his car after the shooting declared, "You want my weaponsthis is how you'll get them," according to investigators.  "The Holocaust is a lie. Obama was created by Jews. Obama does what Jew owners tell him to do. Jews captured America's money. Jews control the mass media. The 1st Amendment is abrogated --henceforth," von Brunn wrote, according to an FBI agent's affidavit.  Previous online postings attributed to James von Brunn promoted the claim that Obama has no valid U.S. birth certificate, a debunked theory rejected by U.S. courts and refuted by a certified copy of his birth certificate from the Hawaii Department of Health.  A November 2008 post that appeared under von Brunn's name declared, "There is no Obama documentationno recordsno paper trailnonethis is no accident. It is being done on purpose with Media helpbut to serve whom & why???"  Von Brunn has been charged with murder in the shooting death of museum guard Stephen Tyrone Johns, 39, and could face the death penalty.  Von Brunn has been living with his son and his son's girlfriend in an apartment in Annapolis, Maryland. The FBI affidavit states he moved in about two years ago, bringing with him two riflesone a .22-caliber, the type used in Wednesday's shooting, and a .30-caliber.  Watch more about who is James von Brunn   Scott Aulbach, the son's former roommate, said von Brunn "didn't like anything about the government" and "was really prejudiced against blacks and Jews." But Aulbach said he was "floored" when he heard the elderly white supremacist was the suspect in the museum attack.  "I knew the guy, and I heard some of the things he had said and some of the things he did in his past, but I never would have expected this to happen," he said. "I mean, it's a tragedy."  But Jesse Demolli, who once exhibited some of von Brunn's paintings in his Maryland art gallery, said he was not surprised by the news.  "He was crazy. He was a lunatic. He was scary as hell," Demolli told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 in Tampa, Florida.  He said about eight years ago, another gallery referred von Brunn to him. Demolli said von Brunn's paintings consisted largely of portraits of Native Americans. He hung about a dozen of the works for about three days, and said von Brunn called every day to find out whether anything had sold.  After three days, he said, von Brunn accused him of not doing enough to sell the paintings, telling him he "really needed money." Demolli said he gave the man $20, which he immediately used to buy beer and cigarettes and returned to the gallery, where he quickly began to disparage residents of the surrounding neighborhood, which was largely African-American.  "Then he started talking about the gas chambers, and I said, 'Jim, that's it. That's it. Time out.' I told him to get out of my gallery, and I started taking his paintings down," Demolli said. As he removed the last painting, he said, von Brunn opened his jacket to show him a pistol.  "He said he really liked me and today is my lucky day, and he left," Demolli said. "He was a crazy, racist man."  Von Brunn's ex-wife said she was in a "state of shock" over the shootings. The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she did not know about her husband's anti-Semitic views until "a few years" into their marriage, and said she "was in total disagreement with his views."  She told Bay News 9 that his views were part of the reason their marriage broke up, which she said happened "over 30 years ago."  "I can't tell you what was in his mind. I have no idea," she said.  Von Brunn grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, attended Washington University there and graduated in 1943 with a degree in journalism. He joined the Navy the same year, became an officer and served in torpedo boats in both Europe and the Pacific, according to Navy records.  In July 1945, just before Japan's surrender, he became skipper of a PT boat. He worked in advertising after the war, and described himself as an artist before his arrest Wednesday.  But by the 1970s, he had become a "hardcore neo-Nazi," according to Heidi Beirich, a researcher for the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center.  Watch more about the debate over free speech and hate crimes   Von Brunn served a federal prison term for a 1981 attempt to kidnap members of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, triggered by anger at what he called the "treacherous and unconstitutional" acts of an institution he called Jewish-controlled.  David Gletty, who infiltrated white supremacist groups for the FBI, said younger members of the movement considered von Brunn "a POW" for his prison time.  "That's a badge of honor to these people," Gletty said. "They look up to that as if, you know, if you're military, you get the badges of honor, like the Medal of Honor and so on."  Von Brunn's Web site promoted his book, "Kill the Best Gentiles," in which he claimed the Jewish-led "Illuminati" and Jewish figures such as Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx worked "to destroy Western civilization and the Aryan nation that created it."  Postings attributed to him on other Web sites declared both Christianity and the Holocaust "hoaxes," and announced that "Hitler's worst mistake" was "he didn't gas the Jews."  
 English champions Chelsea scored six goals for the second successive match of the new Premier League season at home to Wigan Athletic to match Arsenal's effort earlier on Saturday.  Nicolas Anelka and substitute Salomon Kalou scored twice each for the London side, while Florent Malouda and Yossi Benayoun also netted as Chelsea again set the mark for Manchester United to follow ahead of last season's runners-up's trip to Fulham on Sunday.  It was the second successive heavy defeat for Wigan manager Roberto Martinez, leaving the Spaniard an early favorite to be the first casualty of the season.  Wigan beat Chelsea near the start of last season, but suffered an 8-0 thrashing on the final day of the campaign in April and have now shipped 25 goals in five league matches.  France winger Malouda broke the deadlock from close range in the 33rd minute after Frank Lampard's effort was saved by Chris Kirkland, then Anelka scored twice in four minutes after halftimethe second a header set up by last weekend's hat-trick hero Didier Drogba.  Drogba nets hat-trick as Chelsea crush West Brom  James McCarthy hit the post for Wigan, who had an effort by Mauro Boselli ruled out for offside before Malouda's replacement Kalou made it 4-0 in the 78th minute.  Wigan's French Mohamed Diame was carried off with an injury, then Ivory Coast forward Kalou netted another goal with a minute to play and Israeli substitute Benayoun scored his first since joining from Liverpool in time added on.  Young England winger Theo Walcott netted a hat-trick as Arsenal brought promoted Blackpool back to earth with a 6-0 crushing in north London.  Blackpool had thrashed Wigan 4-0 away in the small club's historic first Premier League outing, but were outclassed to end a difficult week following the resignation of chairman Karl Oyston amid reports he may be made bankrupt.  Walcott put Arsenal ahead in the 13th minute, and the match was effectively ended just after half an hour when visiting defender Ian Evatt was sent off for fouling Marouane Chamakh on the edge of the area.  English Premier League preview  Andrei Arshavin scored the resulting penalty, Walcott made it 3-0 six minutes before halftime and Abou Diaby scored the fourth four minutes after the break.  The midfielder set up Walcott's hat-trick goal on 58 and Morocco striker Chamakh made up for a series of misses as he scored his first for Arsenal to seal the romp with eight minutes left.  Tottenham bounced back from the 3-2 Champions League defeat by Young Boys with a controversial 2-1 win at Stoke, despite missing several injured players.  Stoke suffered a second successive defeat as debutant striker Jon Walters' late effort was ruled out despite appearing to have crossed the goal line.  Gareth Bale scored both goals for the London team, the first coming in the 20th minute after his shot was saved and then Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross blocked Peter Crouch's headed rebound into his path.  Striker Ricardo Fuller leveled five minutes later but attacking full-back Bale made it 2-1 on the half-hour with a superb volley.  Stoke suffered a double blow, with Malian striker Mamady Sidibe possibly ruled out for the rest of the season after snapping his Achilles tendon late in the match.  West Ham also fell to a second defeat under new manager Avram Grant, losing 3-1 at home to Bolton as striker Carlton Cole missed a penalty and fellow England international Matthew Upson scored an own-goal.  Jussi Jaaskelainen saved striker Cole's weak 33rd-minute spot-kick before defender Upson headed into his own net three minutes after halftime, then Sweden striker Johan Elmander netted twice either side of Mark Noble's penalty consolation for West Ham (79).  Birmingham also missed a penalty but bounced back to beat Blackburn 2-1 with both goals from Craig Gardner after Steven Nzonzi gave the visitors the lead.  Ben Foster denied Morten Gamst Pedersen five minutes after halftime following Nikola Zigic's foul on Christopher Samba, then French midfielder Nzonzi headed in a corner.  But James McFadden set up Gardner's first on 57 and the midfielder smashed a spectacular winner from long range with 19 minutes to play to leave both teams with three points from two outings this season.  West Brom bounced back from last Saturday's thrashing by beating Sunderland 1-0 thanks to a late winner from new signing Peter Odemwingie, with the Nigeria striker netting in the 81st minute just a day after sealing his move from Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow.  Wolverhampton followed up their opening win with a 1-1 draw at Everton as striker Sylvan Ebanks-Blake's 75th-minute goal canceled out the opener by Australia midfielder Tim Cahill just before halftime.  In Sunday's other game, promoted Newcastle host Aston Villa, while on Monday Liverpool travel to Manchester City.

Sporting an all-black racing suit, Bubacarr Jallow kneels next to his bright red motorcycle to check its oil levels and make sure the nuts and bolts are tightened properly. Satisfied, he hops on his Yamaha AG100 and hits the bumpy dirt road, weaving his way through rugged tracks and treacherous terrain.  Being able to ride along narrow trails and carry out maintenance checks on a motorbike are not talents most health workers in the world need to possess, but for Jallow these skills are crucial.  As a community health nurse, he relies on his two-wheeled companion to reach the isolated villages dotting the Combo Central region in The Gambia, West Africa.  In an area where lack of roads and unreliable transport would typically force patients to spend several hours reaching the nearest clinic on foot or by bicycle, Jallow's durable bike allows him to navigate through the bush to deliver life-saving treatment and health advice to rural communities.  Armed with a medical kit, his routine motorbike round includes visits to at-risk pregnant women and malnourished children. He checks them for any warning signs and, if needed, refers them to the nearest health center. He also distributes mosquito bed nets and food supplements and educates locals about life-threatening diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS.  Jallow says all this wouldn't be possible without Riders for Health (RFH), a social enterprise working to transform healthcare delivery across rural Africa and provide outreach health workers with the transport they need.  The UK-based group says it manages a fleet of more than 1,400 motorcycles, ambulances and other trekking vehicles in seven African countries, reaching about 12 million people.  It trains African health workers to drive safely on difficult terrain and teaches them how to carry out simple maintenance checks on their vehicles on a daily basis. In addition, it ensures that there is a reliable supply chain of spare parts, while a network of local RFH-employed technicians services all bikes and cars monthly to make sure they don't break down.  "I received this motorcycle four years ago when it was brand new and I have ridden until now over 50,000 kilometers," says Jallow, whose work covers more than 10,000 people in 13 villages.  "Since I got my motorcycle I have been getting my regular supply of fuel and my motorcycle is being serviced regularly," he adds. "All of this is towards my services within my community within the past four years, so actually it [RFH] has contributed immensely towards the successful implementation of my activities within my circuit."  Millions of lives are lost needlessly every year from easily preventable and treatable diseases across sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that some 12,000 children in the continent die daily from illnesses and conditions such as pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, malaria and malnutrition.  In many cases, the vaccines and medicines required for treatment are available but fail to reach the millions of people in need due to unreliable transport.  That's what prompted British racing journalist Barry Coleman and his wife Andrea to put RFH together. It all began after Barry visited Somalia in the late 1980s, where he observed scores of new-looking motorbikes and other vehicles lying broken because of poor maintenance. At the same time, he saw first hand the risks posed to mothers and children due to failed healthcare delivery.  "Barry came back and said there are children in rural communities who really need to be reached because they need immunizations; women are dying in childbirth and then 30, 20, 10 miles away in ministry of health car parks there are motorcycles and ambulances that are simply broken because nobody has been trained to repair them, there's no supply chain of parts, there's no knowledge of transport maintenance," remembers Andrea, a mother of three and former motorcycle racer.  "We said, well, we've got a young family, we've got a mortgage but we really believe in this," she adds. "It made us angry, actually, that women and children are dying in rural Africa simply because an old technology like a motorcycle or an ambulance with this internal combustion engine can't be managedwell, that's ridiculous, that is crazy."  The two life-long motorcycle enthusiasts made several more trips to Africa and eventually founded RFH in 1996. The award-winning group, which today has some 300 staff across Africa, raises funds at bike events and auctions as well as from charging the governments, agencies and NGOs it works with a not-for-profit fee for its services.  RFH says its work has enabled outreach health professionals to see nearly six times more people and spend double the time with their patients. They can also hold about 3,500 extra health-education meetings a month across the continent.  Moreover, the group has introduced a motorcycle courier service that speeds up the diagnosis and monitoring of patients suffering from TB or HIV and enables them to start treatment early. In one year, RFH says, mobilized health workers have transported more than 400,000 medical samples and test results between rural health centers and labs.  Andrea says the wellbeing of rural communities changes dramatically once they get regular access to health services.  "We have shown that the maintenance of vehicles is absolutely critical if you are going to be able to solve the health issues of rural Africa," says Andrea. "And also we've shown how transport can be run cost-effectively and how local people really benefit when they are trained to a high standard to be technicians because it provides employment in the communities."  In their mid-60s now, the Colemans are still as passionate about improving access to healthcare as they were when they first started RFH.  "What gets me up in the morning is the idea that health workers who are very highly trainedwomen and men living across Africareally want to get out to their rural communities and make sure that they are healthy," says Andrea. "They can't do that by walking and it makes me really angry that there isn't more emphasis on making sure that transport runs properly."  
 Washington The Federal Aviation Administration has restricted all planes traveling over Iraq from flying at or below 30,000 feet, a threshold similar to the altitude of a Malaysian airliner that was downed over Ukraine.  The FAA restriction issued late Thursday comes in response to fighting in Iraq between government forces and rebel militants from Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.  The new Notice-To-Airmen (NOTAM) from the FAA also prohibits flights into and out of Erbil and Sulaymaniyah.  Erbil, the capital of Iraq's semiautonomous region of Kurdistan, and Sulaymaniyah, a Kurdish controlled city, have been considered safe havens in the conflict, both housing thousands of refugees.  The US has said Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was shot out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile, likely manned by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. That disaster, on July 17, killed all 298 people on board, and raised fears about the safety of international flights over conflict zones.

Washington The Obama administration is drafting new plans to hold suspected terrorists without trial indefinitely but allow them to challenge their imprisonment periodically, a White House official said Tuesday.  A proposed executive order would cover prisoners who can't be tried in civilian courts or before the military commissions set up at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The official provided few details, since the draft had not yet been presented to President Barack Obama. But the official said Obama had pledged in May 2009 to give suspected terrorists some recourse.  "We must have clear, defensible and lawful standards for those who fall in this category," Obama said in a 2009 speech at the National Archives. "We must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes. We must have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified."  The Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that captives held at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay could challenge their detention. But the decision gave no specific guidelines on how often accused terrorists could make their claims.  The latest proposal could be aimed at securing political support for the Obama administration as it ponders whether to bring top al Qaeda figures such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused architect of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, to the United States for trial in a civilian court.  
 A West Nile virus epidemic has prompted a public health emergency in Dallas County, Texas, where the disease has killed nine people, a judge declared Friday.  The virus there infected 175 people, said Patricia Huston of Dallas County Health and Human Services.  Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins declared the emergency in his capacity as director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management and instructed the department to file a local disaster declaration with the state.  "This declaration will expand our avenues for assistance in our ongoing battle with West Nile virus," Jenkins said in a statement.  West Nile virus on the rise in the U.S.  Insecticide spraying by planes will be offered to certain communities hit hard by the virus as long as those local governments request it, Jenkins told reporters.  The aerial spraying would occur from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., when children are inside, Jenkins said.  "The insecticide is safe," Jenkins said. "The planes are quite sophisticated, and they get the spray to where it needs to go."  The judge organized an invitation-only work session Friday with county, state and federal officials to discuss a response to the epidemic.  The United States is experiencing its biggest spike in West Nile virus since 2004, with 241 cases of the disease reported nationwide this year so far, including four deaths, health officials said last weekend, before the latest totals.  Of the 42 states that have reported infections in people, birds or mosquitoes, 80% of them have been in Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. The CDC listed a breakdown of infections by state.  "It is not clear why we are seeing more activity than in recent years," said Marc Fischer, a CDC medical epidemiologist. "Regardless of the reasons for the increase, people should be aware of the West Nile virus activity in their area and take action to protect themselves and their family."  The virus is transmitted through infected mosquitoes.  In the United States, most infections occur between June and September, and peak in August, according to the CDC.  Symptoms include fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash.  "Less than 1% develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the brain or surrounding tissues)," the CDC said.  Those at greater risk are people older than 50 and those with conditions such as cancer, diabetes and kidney disease, or with organ transplants.  There are no medications to treat West Nile virus or vaccines to prevent infection. People with milder illnesses typically recover on their own, but those more seriously affected may need hospital care.  Health experts say prevention measures include avoiding mosquito bites, using insect repellant and getting rid of insect breeding sites.  Symptoms of West Nile virus  CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.

Fire up the griddle! Much of a huge cache of maple syrup snatched from a Quebec storage facility has been recovered, police say.  Three people have been arrested and five others are being sought in connection with the theft from a warehouse in Saint-Louis-de-Blandford, Quebec Provincial Police said in a statement Tuesday. The theft occurred between August 2011 and July 2012, police said.  Two-thirds of the syrup was recovered, according to a police statement. The Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, which bills itself as keeper of the global strategic maple syrup reserve, said in August that up to 10 million pounds of the sweet stuff was in the warehouse from which the theft occurred but could not say exactly how much was missing. The total value of all the syrup in the warehouse was put at $30 million.  The theft was discovered during a routine inventory check of the warehouse, which "had been secured by a fence and locks, and visited regularly," federation president Serge Beaulieu said in a statement in August.  The barrels that originally contained the syrup were empty, meaning it was somehow transferred to other containers to complete the theft, the federation said.  Police said Tuesday that they had seized vehicles that were used to transport the stolen sticky stuff as well as carts, lifts, scales and kettles.  They said their investigation of the thefts covered the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario as well as the northern United States. Almost 300 people were interviewed as part of the investigation, police said.  As much as 80% of the world's maple syrup comes from Quebec, the federation says.  
 Here in Boston, people will grieve for many days. How could anyone be so evil as to plant a bomb that would murder an 8-year-old child, rip the legs off parents and devastate a celebration of athletics that is pure joy. These were murders that wrench the soul.  But if these cowards thought they would scare this citythat their acts of terror would actually terrorizethey picked the wrong place. Boston, as President Barack Obama so rightly said Monday night, is a "tough and resilient town"always has been and always will be. It will heal but will not forget; it will care for the wounded but will make the murderers pay their price.  Boston has a reputation as an intellectual town, and it is that. Two of the world's best universities are here, along with a dozen other fine colleges and universities. It is electric with creativity and innovation. As they showed again after the bombing, its doctors and hospitals are world-class. Citizens can find a great concert or art gallery anytime they want. No wonder that in contrast to most other aging cities, young and old are streaming here to live these days.  But that doesn't mean Boston is soft. Just the opposite. Boston has plenty of fight, toojust ask any team that has banged up against the Patriots, Red Sox, Celtics or Bruins. Since 2004, don't forget, Boston has won championships in all four major sports. That doesn't happen to softies.  Rothkopf: In the face of terror, keep calm  The graveyards here are full of glorious men and womenbrave souls who carved the first communities out of wilderness, stood up first against British oppression, stood up first against the abomination of slavery, stood up early for the rights of women, and in recent years has stood up early and often for the rights of gays and lesbians. Harvard has lots of Nobel laureates, but it is also proud that it has the largest number of Medal of Honor winners of any university, save the military academies.  Traditionally, the marathon itself occurs on Patriots' Day in Massachusettsa moment when people take time off to remember Lexington and Concord. One can watch re-enactments of the British marching to rid themselves of rebelsand men without uniform but deadeyes with a rifle picking them off from the woods. If you want to remember the grit of the early men and women of Massachusetts, pull down your copies of David McCullough's histories. Reread "1776" and its fabulous stories of Bunker Hill and lifting the British siege of Boston (when men pulled cannons all the way across Massachusetts to chase away the most powerful navy in the world).  Or reread "John Adams," the book that was originally intended to be about Adams and Jeffersonuntil McCullough fell out of love with Jefferson and into love with Abigail. One of my favorite episodes in the Adams book occurs when her husband insists on taking their teenage son, John Quincy, on a perilous voyage to England. Abigail writes a farewell letter to John Quincy that captures the New England spirit:  "It is not in the still calm of life, or the repose of a pacific station, that great characters are formed. The habits of a vigorous mind are formed in contending with difficulties. Great necessities call out great virtues ... qualities which would otherwise lay dormant wake into life and form the character of the hero and the statesman."  In most of the country, that spirit is called toughness; in New England, it is often called hardiness. And with the passage of time, it has not disappeared.  LZ: It can happen anywhere  Monday's bombings cap a 50-year period for Boston that has been marked by violence, tragedy and grief. It started with the assassination of a favorite son, John F. Kennedy, in 1963, and continued with the assassination of his brother Robert, later the plane crash of young John Jr. and the loss of another brother, Ted. So much sadness across these years.  Yet there has been more. Massachusetts lost 1,537 in Vietnam, 12 in the first Gulf War, and 118 so far in Iraq and Afghanistan. On 9/11, two of those planes flew from Boston's Logan International Airport. Violence has also stalked the streets of Boston, but as they have done so often, people here stood up against the tide. In the late 1980s, gang violence and murder were rampant; by 1990, Boston felt like Chicago today as it had the highest number of killings in its history, many among the young.  Opinion: Our 'greatest day' turns to horror  But even if it is occasionally knocked down, as it was by these bombings, the real Boston story is how it always gets up again. That spree in the '80s and early '90s of kids killing kids, even at funerals, so shocked the city that leaders of all stripespolitical, religious, business, nonprofitinitiated a comprehensive, community-based strategy to reach at-risk youth early, and over five years, the rate of youth homicides dropped 80%. There was an upward spike in the mid 2000s, but the numbers are now again falling steadily.  War, violence, tragedyBoston won't surrender to darker forces.  Monday's bombings shattered any feeling of safety. People here looked with horror into the abyss. But count on it: Boston is still alive with the spirit of Abigail Adams. Great necessities will call out great virtues, and qualities that may seem dormant will wake into life, forming the character of new heroes and new leaders.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.

Every day, millions of people like 16-year-old Celeste live their lives shouldering a huge emotional weight forged by fear, uncertainty and separation.  She was only 10 years old when the reality of her family's desperate situation hit her in the face.  Rolando Zenteno has lived more than half his 18 years in the United States, yet he still feels like an outsider.  Another undocumented immigrantPrerna Lalis fighting to stay in her adopted homeland and dreaming of becoming an immigration lawyer.  As Washington lawmakers try to hammer out an immigration reform plan while avoiding political gridlock, millions of people find themselves caught in the middlesuspended between two worldswhile not really belonging to either.  Some immigrants spoke to CNN, giving permission to use their full names. Others chose to withhold their last names, fearing it would affect their legal status. Here are their stories.  'Now's the time' to move on immigration, Obama says  Celeste, 16: She's carrying a 'big old rock'  Celeste was 10 years old when police pulled over her dad while he was driving near their south Georgia home. She recalls crying as she frantically translated the officer's words from English into Spanish for her father. She feared her family would be deported back to Mexico, but the officer let them go.  The family got a second chance, but Celeste never shook the dread that filled her that daythe fear that she could be sent back to a country she barely remembers, or get separated from the family that she loves. That's why immigration reform must happen now, she says.  "It would be a big old rock that would be lifted from our shoulders," she says.  She says any policy changes should create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants like her parents, who are agricultural workers. Celeste says they came to the United States from Mexico to give their children a better life.  Last year, the Obama administration's deferred action program gave her the hope of a reprieve. But that isn't enough, she says.  "It's like being out in the cold and me having the only blanket in the family."  Mexico welcomes new U.S. immigration reform push  Rolando Zenteno, 18: 'In limbo'  Zenteno has lived in the United States since he was 7, and says he identifies more with American culture than his native Mexico.  But he feels like he's in limbo, and it's a constant struggle.  "I identify myself with the American culture," he says, "but at the same time the American society is like 'No, you're not part of us.'"  Zenteno says talk of immigration reform is encouraging, even though it's a problem the president has pledged before to tackleand then failed to solve.  Actions speak louder than words, says Zenteno, a freshman who is studying journalism at Armstrong Atlantic State University in Savannah, Georgia.  "At the end of the day, the political parties will do what they can" for votes, he says.  And with what he's seen so far when it comes to immigration reform, Zenteno says if he ever had a chance to vote in the United States, he wouldn't cast a ballot for Democrats or Republicans.  Ana, 20: Everything is complicated  Ana was 10 when her mother decided she'd had enough of Michoacan, Mexico, packed up the family and moved to the United States.  "When you first get here, you think like you're like everyone else," Ana says.  Sometime around the eighth grade, though, she began to realize she was different. While friends were starting to think about their futures, where they might move to or go to school, Ana "hit the wall."  She feels stuck. Everything is complicated because she is undocumentedfinding an apartment, a good job, securing loans for school.  Ana currently works at a jewelry kiosk in Atlanta.  If immigration reform were to become a reality, she says she'd like to study psychology and find a better paying job so as not to be a burden to her parents. She'd also like to go to Mexico to visit relatives she hasn't seen since she was a little girl.  "If they want to make it a little strict, that's OK ... so they don't think they're giving it to us," Ana says.  Immigration plan: New era of bipartisanship or political necessity?  Prerna Lal, 28: It's not just Latinos  Many Americans connect the immigration issue to Latinos, but it's broader than that, says Lal. She came to the United States from the Pacific island of Fiji when she was just 14. Now, she's fighting a legal battle in court to avoid deportation.  "I don't think it's a bad thing to really focus on this amazingly powerful voting bloc," she says. "I do think that people need to look at immigration from a lens that shifts from just 'those Mexicans just coming across the border' to the many people from Asia and from Europe who are still stuck in the system."  The government should stop deporting people, she says, and focus on fixing a broken system that leaves many people in limbo even when they follow the rules.  "Everyone talks about going to the back of the line being the number one thing that undocumented immigrants should do. I have been in several different lines. ... The issue is there are so many undocumented immigrants that are caught up in lines that never really go anywhere," she says.  Lal is a third-year law student at George Washington University. No matter what happens with the latest reform efforts, she plans to become an immigration lawyer.  Tania, 43: Citizenship means everything  Tania's family is a hodgepodge of legal statuses. She and her husband are undocumented, as are their two oldest children. Their younger four were born in the United States and are citizens.  "For my family, it would be the best," she says about immigration reform. She wants a change that would lead to citizenship.  "For my husband, it would mean a good job where he wouldn't be abused by bosses. And for my children, it would mean they could continue their studies," she says.  Her husband works at a recycling plant. She is from Ecuador. Tania spoke at an immigrant rights organization in Queens, New York.  Voices for and agaiunst immigration reform proposals  Vasant Shetty, 59: Hope and hard work  In India, Shetty says he never could have imagined starting his own business or sending his two children to college. In the United States, he has done both of those things. On Monday, Shetty was answering phones at the front desk of his motel in central Arizona. When he bought it, he said the property was in shambles. He then renovated it into a place he's proud to own.  "I came to this country with lots of hope, almost 15 years ago. It was very hard," he says. "Today I have two motels. I never used any shortcuts. It was all hard work, all the time."  As President Barack Obama prepared to deliver an immigration reform speech in Nevada on Tuesday, Shetty braced himself  to appear in an Arizona immigration court. There, a judge may decide whether he should be deported.  Immigrant rights activists have asked federal officials to drop their case against him, arguing that deporting him would unjustly separate his family and unfairly punish someone with no criminal history.  Despite his personal battles with the U.S. immigration system, talk about immigration reform makes Shetty feel optimistic. Time and time again, he says, America has shown him kindness and opportunity.  "I believe this country has a lot of good people," he says. "There is a way. They will do something good."  Mario, 33: Faith and fear  Mario lives in constant fear of being picked up by the police.  "Just to come here, I have to think," he says, weighing whether the trip was worth the risk.  "Here" in his case is Plaza Fiesta, a mall in Atlanta that caters to immigrants. As he spoke Monday, TVs showed senators announcing their plan for reform. No one paid attention to the screens, which could barely be heard over the noise of the food court and nearby arcade games.  Mario has lived in the United States for 13 years. He moved from the capital of Mexico. He cleans offices for a living and says he would like to see some sort of change so that he could find better work, maybe buy a car or a house.  Mostly though, he wants reform so he could feel free, free of fear.  "I still have faith," he says. "Who knows when? Maybe it won't happen tomorrow or the day after, but sometime ... Faith never dies."  Opinion: Immigrant - Can we trust Obama?  
 Despite being allowed to tell her husband he won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, the wife of Liu Xiaobo was detained in her apartment in Beijing, China, according to a human rights group and her attorney.  Liu Xia has not been charged with a crime, but "appears to be under a de facto house arrest," said Beth Schwanke, legislative counsel for the U.S.-based group Freedom Now.  She was taken to see Liu Xiaobo in a prison several hundred miles northeast of Beijing, Schwanke said, and tell him of the honor.  Upon hearing he had received the peace prize, Schwanke said, Liu Xiaobo began to cry, and said, "This is for the martyrs of Tiananmen Square."  But upon return to Beijing, Liu Xia was not allowed to leave her apartment, Schwanke said. No one is allowed in, and her telephone is believed to be "destroyed," Schwanke said. Liu Xia has been able to post to some Twitter accounts, said Schwanke, who called the action "absolutely outrageous."  "Brothers, I have come back," said a Twitter post purportedly from Liu Xia. "I have been under house arrest since the 8th and don't know when I'll get to see everyone again. They broke my mobile phone so I can no longer make or receive calls."  "I saw Xiaobo, who learned about his winning the prize in prison on the evening of the 9th," she wrote. "We'll talk about the future later."  Since her husband was named as a 2010 Nobel laureate, Liu Xia has gained 1,000 new Twitter followers.  "Xia can't use her mobile phone anymore," tweeted Chinese dissident Wang Jinbo. "I got in touch through some other means. She can't leave homethey've tightened the security outside." He said Liu Xia can tweet"a little freedom."  "Liu Xia is under enormous pressure," said Dr. Yang Jianli, a member of Liu Xiaobo's defense team and a human rights specialist with Freedom Now. "We hope that world leaders will immediately condemn this shameful act by the Chinese government and urge Liu Xia's immediate and unconditional release."  See more of CNN's special coverage of China  Beijing did not comment immediately on the report of Liu Xia's detention, and the official news agency Xinhua was silent on the subject.  On Friday, Liu Xia said she was packing to visit her husband under the surveillance of police officers, who promised to take her to visit Liu Xiaobo Saturday. She said she could not wait to see him to tell him he is this year's peace laureate.  Liu Xiaobo won the prize Friday, but news of the win has been blacked out in China, with no mention of it on Chinese media.  The same censorship applies to Chinese blogs, and authorities have blocked the Nobel Peace Prize section of the official Nobel website.  At least two international television networksCNN and BBCwere blacked out as the Nobel committee announced the winner on Friday, and CNN's reports on Liu remained blacked out for most of the day.  Liu was sentenced in 2009 to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion of state power.  He is the co-author of Charter 08, a call for political reform and human rights, and was an adviser to the student protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989.  His wife called the Nobel Prize "an affirmation of what he has fought for."  Schwanke said Liu Xiaobo is doing well in prisonmuch better physically than when he was held in solitary confinement. Mentally, he remains very strong, she said, adding that this prison sentence is his fourth and "he knows this is necessary to secure democracy and human rights in China."  Freedom Now attorneys, as Liu's international counsel, will leverage international political and legal support while his attorneys in China will continue to work on his behalf in Beijing, she said.  Liu Xiaobo's longtime friend Pu Zhiqiang said the prize may not help Liu right now, but it will have effects for the future.  "In the long run, it will leave a legacy that is sure to help bring democratic reform and freedom to China, that will far outlast Liu's life," Pu told CNN outside the gates of Liu's apartment complex.  The Chinese government was angry at the win, calling it "blasphemy against the peace prize" that could harm relations between China and Norway, where the Norwegian Nobel Committee is located.  "Liu Xiaobo is a convicted criminal sentenced to jail by Chinese justice. His acts are in complete contradiction to the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said.  Human rights groups like Amnesty International, world leaders such as U.S. President Barack Obama, and governments around the world all praised the awarding of the prize to Liu, with many calling on the Chinese government to free him.  CNN's Brian Walker and Steven Jiang contributed to this report.

(EW.com)"Sleepy Hollow" gives the Headless Horseman a shotgun, and the shotgun appears to fire explosive rounds. In the first half hour, three people get their heads cut off.  And you know how throughout American history there have been witch trials, which historians retroactively consider the result of mass hysteria? Turns out all those witches were actually witches.  None of these things even comes close to being the kookiest part of the series premiere of "Sleepy Hollow," a crazypants  and entertaining, if you squint  hour of television.  Our critic Jeff Jensen has already weighed in with a look at some of the deeper resonances in the show.  The goofy, intriguing, timely allegory that is Fox's 'Sleepy Hollow'  What follows is a handy primer for the show's insanity:  The episode starts in the middle of a Revolutionary War battle, which you have to admit is not a common starting place for TV shows. Nor, for that matter, can I think of any other TV show in history that has suddenly introduced an invulnerable British soldier wearing an "Eyes Wide Shut" mask.  And certainly, it's rare for the protagonist of a TV show to chop off someone's head in the first three minutes of his show.  We don't really know who this guy is yet, except that obviously we do because the title of the show is Sleepy Hollow and we all remember Disney's Ichabod Crane song. After being knocked out and losing a lot of blood during his fight with the British Masked Horseman, Ichabod Crane suddenly wakes up inside of a cave covered in weird cave stuff. When he wakes up, a couple of glass jars break. One of them contains a snake, and one of them contains a frog. This will probably be important later, unless it's not.  Fox orders 'Sleepy Hollow' pilot from 'Star Trek' team  Ichabod immediately runs into the middle of a road and almost gets hit by not one, but two terribly animated digital cars. The second one actually clips him. Actor Tom Mison kind of sells it.  So, to recap, in the first five minutes, the protagonist of "Sleepy Hollow" has decapitated a Redcoat, flash-forwarded 250 years in history, woken up in a cave, and been hit by a car.  Elsewhere in Sleepy Hollow, we meet Clancy Brown, who's basically playing the same character Jeff Fahey played on the first episode of "Under the Dome." He fires 12 rounds of ammunition at the Headless Horseman and gets his head chopped off.  In one of the night's many flashbacks, we see Ichabod in a Revolutionary War-era infirmary. He's hanging out with his wife, who is a nurse, and also a priest who appears to be immortal. But none of that is important right now! What is important is that they put a Bible on Ichabod's body, and in the present day, Ichabod finds it and flips right to the Book of Revelation and decides that the Headless Horseman is the First Horseman of the Apocalypse. And they keep on reading Revelations throughout the episode to get clues about stuff.  So basically, the Book of Revelation is to "Sleepy Hollow" as Edgar Allen Poe is to "The Following." So excited for the "Seven Trumpets" musical episode!  Also, George Washington is in this TV show. Although he only appears in flashbacks that are shot like re-enactments on "Unsolved Mysteries." Anyhow, all you have to know is that the pilot of "Sleepy Hollow" features the line "The answers are in Washington's Bible!" So it's basically "National Treasure" meets "Assassin's Creed 3" meets "Picket Fences."  Remember that immortal priest I mentioned? Turns out that he's telekinetic or whatever! He tries to hold off the Headless Horseman using his brain to control chains, but the Horseman cuts through them with his axe, which I should mention is heated to 500 degrees. This priest also gets decapitated.  Trailers for the new Fox Fall 2013 TV shows  We should mention Ichabod's new partner, Abbie. When we meet her, she initially seems like an everywoman police officer. She is also the source of most of the pilot's self-mocking exposition, including the immortal line, "So the killer is the First Horseman of the Apocalypse, and the proof is a Bible we found in a cave."  But it turns out that she has a crazy history. When she was young, she and her sister were wandering through the forest, when suddenly they saw four white trees, which represent the Four Horseman probably, because numbers. They also saw a strange creature. Then they blacked out. (It turns out that Clancy Brown was investigating this and many other mysteries before he died, and basically "Sleepy Hollow" is "Twin Peaks" plus "Cabot Cove.")  It also turns out that Ichabod Crane's wife is a witch who is currently residing in some weird dimension in the forest that looks like Fairyland in "True Blood." She's a good witch, though, and she's trying to stop the apocalypse, but there's a group of bad witches who are trying to cause the apocalypse. Somewhere, the decapitated head of Washington Irving is rolling his eyes.  Right about the time that the Headless Horseman starts firing a shotgun, you're probably thinking to yourself, "Certainly the only thing sillier than this would be that the shotgun appears to be shooting fireworks." Gentlemen, your chariot has arrived. The fireworks don't hit anyone, because this is broadcast TV and you can't show anyone getting shot, although you can show three decapitations.  John Cho appears in the pilot episode as a duplicitous cop who is a witch or whatever, and is mostly just there to remind you how much you liked John Cho's character arc in "FlashForward." He gets killed by some kind of strange creature who appears in the mirror and is basically the devil, probably.  Also, the Headless Horseman's Horse has red eyes. Spooky!  So there's no way the show can possibly maintain this momentum week-to-week, unless at the end of episode 4, America launches its nuclear arsenal at the Moon in order to destroy an attacking horde of bat-people. But I would watch the heck out of that show.  What did you think of the Sleepy Hollow premiere, fellow viewers?  See the original story at EW.com.

 Singer-songwriter David Crosby hit a jogger with his car Sunday evening, a spokesman said.  The accident happened in Santa Ynez, California, near where Crosby lives.  Crosby was driving at approximately 50 mph when he struck the jogger, according to California Highway Patrol Spokesman Don Clotworthy. The posted speed limit was 55.  The jogger suffered multiple fractures, and was airlifted to a hospital in Santa Barbara, Clotworthy said. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening.  "Mr. Crosby was cooperative with authorities and he was not impaired or intoxicated in any way. Mr. Crosby did not see the jogger because of the sun," said Clotworthy.  According to the spokesman, the jogger and Crosby were on the same side of the road.  Pedestrians are supposed to be on the left side of the road walking toward traffic, Clotworthy said. Joggers are considered pedestrians.  Crosby is known for weaving multilayered harmonies over sweet melodies. He belongs to the celebrated rock group Crosby, Stills & Nash.  "David Crosby is obviously very upset that he accidentally hit anyone. And, based off of initial reports, he is relieved that the injuries to the gentleman were not life threatening," said Michael Jensen, a Crosby spokesman. "He wishes the jogger a very speedy recovery."

Kabul, Afghanistan Taliban fighters armed with guns and explosives clashed with security forces after taking over a building near the airport in the Afghan capital on Monday.  The fighting ended with all seven attackers dead, Afghan officials said.  The Taliban said the attack was intended to target Americans in Kabul International Airport, one part of which is used by military forces and another by civilians.  The assault on the five-story building, which is under construction, began with two suicide bombers blowing themselves up, said Kabul police official Hashtmat Stanikzai.  At least five attackers then stormed into the structure and exchanged fire with security forces, he said.  They were eventually killed, said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Afghan interior ministry.  The attack left two civilians, including a woman, injuredbut no security personnel were hurt, Sediqqi said.  NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan said it was under lock down during the attack but had "no operational information" about what was happening.  Insurgents have carried out frequent attacks on security forces across Afghanistan in recent months amid a spring offensive by the Taliban.  Last month, a suicide car bombing on a coalition convoy in central Kabul killed at least 12 people, six of them American and six Afghan.  The insurgent group Hezb-e Islami claimed responsibility for that attack. The group is not under the Taliban leadership, but operates alongside them.  
 New York Protesters rallied in downtown New York City Thursday to voice their anger over what they perceive as the roles Wall Street and big banks played in America's economic crisis.  Marching from City Hall to Wall Street, the protesters chanted "good jobs for all," and held signs with messages including "Hold banks accountable," "Make Wall Street Pay," and "Reclaim America."  The AFL-CIO organized the rally, and union President Richard Trumka addressed the crowd, saying, "How long will we allow the spirit of greed to continue to drive us into economic holes?"  The National People's Action, a group that was involved in organizing the protest, said in a news release that demonstrators represented unemployed workers, foreclosure victims and community activists.  Protester Gerard Pettine said he just wants Wall Street to be held accountable for its involvement in the economic collapse.  "They need to have some integrity and some honor and do the right thing," Pettine told CNN.  Protester Elizabeth Soto, who came with her brother to the rally, was concerned about the lack of job creation.  "We are here to say Wall Street's got to help Main Street," she said. "We supported the stimulus bill, which bailed out Wall Street, but we expected the jobs to come back to Main Street."  The New York Police Department estimated that 6,000 people participated in the rally.  Earlier Thursday, as part of a larger "day of action" against Wall Street, protesters descended upon the headquarters of two New York City banksJP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargoleaving letters for the banks' chief executive officers.  The letters, according to the news release from the National People's Action, said that the banks have an opportunity "to step up to the plate and be leaders in rebuilding the American economy."  JP Morgan spokesperson Mike Fusco declined to comment on the letter, but said that there were a "couple dozen" protesters who were in the building for less than a half hour.  Fran Durst of Wells Fargo said that about 100 protesters flooded their building's lobby and tried to deliver their letter to the bank's CEO. Durst said the event didn't cause a major disruption to the bank.  Other protests were scheduled in San Francisco, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and Charlotte, North Carolina, according to the National People's Action news release.  CNN's Mary Snow, Jennifer Rizzo, Cassie Spodak, and Kristen Hamill contributed to this report.

Members of Ukraine's newly elected parliament came to blows Wednesday amid accusations of changing political views, and the mayhem prevented the election of a new prime minister and speaker.  The disruption started when members of the opposition tried to prevent two of its members from being sworn in because of suspicions that they had changed their political views.  Read more: Ukraine: Caught between East and West  One member's ear was torn, and others were thrown out of the session and the doors were blocked. The action was broadcast live on the parliamentary channel in Ukraine.  Later, members of the Svoboda Party, which came in fifth in national elections held in October, broke the doors and a metal detector at the parliament's entrance to let even more members in.  "We knocked and knocked," said Svoboda Party MP Yuriy Syrotyuk. "The question is, who locked the doors for the members of parliament?"  Read more: Tymoshenko blasts Ukraine leader from prison  Member walked on tables, on their colleagues' heads and the speaker's seat. The number of injuries has not been released.  Eventually members agreed to suspend the session and resume Thursday. "Our negotiations were successful" said Oleksandr Efremov, a member of the Temporary Parliamentary Panel. "We negotiated to continue negotiations."  According to Ukrainian law, members of parliament are inviolable and cannot be punished, and police cannot intervene. Therefore, fights among members, many of whom are or were professional athletes, are common. Notably, Heavyweight World Boxing Champion Vitali Klitchko, also a party leader, was not involved in Wednesday's fisticuffs.  Elections in October left the ruling Party of Regions, led by President Viktor Yanukovich, in power. The second-place party, the United Opposition coalition, is organized by former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko, who is in prison on charges of abuse of authority, a punishment seen by the United States and Europe as politically motivated.  
 Call it "Occupy Facebook." Or, perhaps, "UnOccupy Facebook."  Hoping to capitalize on frustrations with the social networking giant, not to mention some of the anti-corporate sentiment bubbling up on Wall Street and beyond, entrepreneurs have launched an upstart site called Unthink.  The Tampa, Florida-based startup wants to be everything that Facebook and rival Google+ are notand it has the manifesto and sassy YouTube video to prove it.  "I couldn't wait to tell my story. I couldn't believe that all this was free," says an actress in the video, strutting through Bohemian city streets in an off-the-shoulder T-shirt with the words "Wild and Free" scrawled on it. "But I never knew that I'd be part of some damn puppet showthat you thought you could own me. Well, you can't own me!"  Later, she confronts a guy in a Google+ T-shirt and another hoodie-wearing character with a striking resemblance to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.  The video is part of a series of hype-building efforts, along with cryptic news releases promising a "secret project" and "social revolution," that preceded Tuesday's limited launch.  Opened for invite-only beta testing on Tuesday, Unthink says it will offer an alternative to the privacy concerns some people have about using Facebook or Google's new rival network.  Facebook and Google both collect information about users to tailor advertising to them. Privacy concerns have cropped up over various features Facebook has rolled outfrom mobile check-ins to integration with other websites that can make a user's online behavior more public if settings aren't tweaked.  Unthink promises that, under its terms of use, all content will remain the property of the user. After signing up, an app lets users transfer photos and other info from Facebook to the new site.  "We worked hard for more than three years to research people's needs and present them with a solution that will empower them," Unthink CEO and founder Natasha Dedis said on the company's website. "Our mission is to emancipate social media and unleash people's extraordinary potential. Ournot so covertmission is to spark a social revolution. We believe in people."  Dedis said she had the idea for the site when her son wanted to join Facebook and she read what she called the site's oppressive terms of use.  According to TechCrunch, the site is bankrolled with about $2.5 million in investments from venture capitalists.  And its business model for fighting the corporate social-media giants? Corporate sponsorships.  The site will let users either pick a participating business (presumably one they like) to "sponsor" their page or pay a $2 annual fee for the service.  Through much of Wednesday, after tech blogs began reporting on it, pulling up the Unthink site delivered an "over capacity" message.  Unthink isn't the first startup that has hoped to capitalize on anti-Facebook sentiment. Last spring, Diaspora raised $200,000 on crowd-funding site Kickstarter to develop a decentralized networking site. But more than a year and a half later, only an unfinished alpha version has been rolled out and, last month, developers sent out a plea for more money to people who have already signed up.  The question, of course, is whether there's any appetite for yet another social networking platform in a landscape dominated by Facebook, with its 800 million users, and to a lesser extent, Twitter.  Even Google has struggled to pull users away from Facebook where, despite complaints, users have appeared willing to deal with occasional privacy concerns in return for a convenient online hangout populated by all their friends.  But if even a small percentage of those users choose to abandon ship for the "revolution," it may be enough for Unthink to declare victory.

Barcelona, Spain Pope Benedict XVI on Saturday began his second visit to Spain, where he prayed at the tomb of an apostle and planned to consecrate one of Barcelona's most famous sightsthe distinctive Gaudi-designed Sagrada Familia church.  The pope's first stop on his two-day trip is Santiago de Compostela, in Spain's northwestern tip, an important pilgrimage site for centuries.  The cathedral there was built 900 years ago atop what is said to be the tomb of St. James, an apostle of Jesus. After praying there, the pope presided over a Eucharist in the square outside, to celebrate the city's jubilee year.  "I come as a pilgrim on this Compostelean Saint Year ... I want to join to that long line of men and women that all over the centuries had come to [Santiago de] Compostela from different places on the peninsula and Europe," the pontiff said at the airport earlier in the day.  Saturday night, the pope planned to head all the way across Spain to Barcelona, the Catalan city on the Mediterranean.  Barcelona is home to the Sagrada Familia, or "holy family," church, still being built after more than 100 years. Benedict is expected to designate the church a basilica, a special honor in Roman Catholicism.  Antoni Gaudi, a Catalan architect, only lived to see one tower and most of one facade finished by the time he died in 1926.  "The interior space of the church, the sacred space of the church, is finished, and for that, the pope comes here to consecrate the church," said Jordi Fauli, the deputy architect.  Gaudi planned the church to have 18 towers12 for the apostles and the tallest for Jesus. Only eight are finished.  Fauli said the privately-financed work may be done by 2026, on the 100th anniversary of Gaudi's death.  Asked once why it was taking so long to finish the Sagrada Familia, Gaudi replied, according to his assistants, "My clientmeaning Godis not in a hurry."  
 The death toll from massive floods in Pakistan rose to 1,497 on Friday as U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said the crisis is a "slow-motion tsunami" that is expected to grow.  The number of homeless as a result of flooding has doubled to 4 million.  Ban urged the international community to give more aid during a special fundraising meeting Thursday night.  "Make no mistake," he said. "This is a global disaster, a global challenge. It is one of the greatest tests of global solidarity in our times."  The U.N. secretary-general, who traveled to Pakistan last weekend to visit sites devastated by the disaster, said almost 20 million people need shelter, food and emergency care.  "That is more than the entire population hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Kashmir earthquake, Cyclone Nargis, and the earthquake in Haiticombined," he said.  Are you there? Share your photos and videos  The United Nations has already appealed for $460 million over the next three months, Ban said, and although donors delivered more than a half, the available resources are not sufficient to meet the needs on the ground.  The European Commission has pledged 40 million euros ($51 million) since July 31 for the flood victims. It said it will mobilize an additional 30 million euros (about $38 million).  "This disaster is like few the world has ever seen. It requires a response to match," Ban said. "Pakistan needs a flood of support."  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who also attended the General Assembly meeting, announced an additional $60 million in U.S. aid. The funds bring to $150 million the amount pledged to Pakistan by the United States.  "I want the people of Pakistan to know: The United States will be with you through this crisis," she said. "We will be with you as the rivers rise and fall. We will be with you as you replant your fields and repair your roads. And we will be with you as you meet the long-term challenge to build a stronger nation and a better future for your families."  Clinton urged other nations to help the nation meet its funding goals.  Analysts have blamed "donor fatigue" for the delay in aid.  Pakistan has been on a seemingly constant round of donor needsto revive its feeble economy, to fight the Taliban and to recover from the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2009 refugee crisis.

Some voters are still pining for Mitt Romney to pick a dream running mate who's likely out of reacha candidate who has said she won't run.  "Gov. Romney, if you're watching, please pick Condoleezza Rice," said Geoffrey Phillips, a Romney supporter in Cotati, California. "She's going to help you with your expertise and foreign affairs, and she has all the experience you're looking for. I think she will help swing the election your way when it comes time. I think she'll add that excitement that your campaign needs."  CNN asked iReporters across the political spectrum to weigh in on who would best fill out Romney's ticket. Among the dozens of responses, Rice, the former secretary of state under George W. Bush, was the most popular pick. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty were among other popular choices.  Rating Romney's possible running mates  Rice, who some see as a Republican Hillary Clinton, has made it pretty clear she's not interested in the job of vice president:  "I cannot imagine myself running for office," she told CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight" in January. "Not because politics are so tough, but it's just not me."  Rice reiterated on CBS News last month, "There is no way that I will do this because it's really not me. Gov. Romney needs to find someone who wants to run with him. There are many people who will do it very, very well."  Still, voters seem to be calling out her name as they wait for Romney's expected VP announcement.  "She's so experienced in the government, she's extremely intelligent, she's a woman and she's African-American," said iReporter Kathi Cordsen from Fullerton, California. "All of these qualities could help Romney beat Obama, and to me, that's the main goal."  A Romney-Rice ticket would restore "hope to America," said Vernon Hill of Morehead City, North Carolina.  "Romney and Rice would bring back prosperity, enthusiasm and complement each other in bringing America back to the great country we once were," Hill said. "Rice is not a career politician; she left Washington when her time was up and never, ever looked back. This makes a statement to the character of this lady."  Sam Otto, 16, concedes that Rice would complement Romney on foreign affairs but said, "If that's the point, you can just reappoint her as secretary of state. That's what secretary of state is for." The teen from Johnson Creek, Wisconsin, said he thinks his home state can offer the perfect running mate for Romney.  "I'd pick Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan," he said, "because he's a safe, yet daring pick and is young but is still experienced, so he could, from on Day One, step into the presidency."  Otto said that despite Ryan being in his early 40s, he has a lot of experience, as he has been in the House of Representatives since 1999. Add in that Ryan is from Wisconsin and that he could appeal to both tea party and establishment GOP figures, Otto said.  Speaking of certain states being key, Ohio is another one that may be important for Romney.  Arthur Oliva, a college student in Oxford, Ohio, argues that Portman is the man for the job.  "Whoever wins Ohio can pretty much guarantee the presidency," he said. "Portman is a pretty popular senator in the state. He won his last election by a landslide, and he still remains pretty popular, especially in his home county of Hamilton."  Oliva supports President Barack Obama but said Romney should also pick Portman because "he is a proven attack dog, and he has foreign policy credentials."  Some said they thought loyalty to Romney should play a larger role than credentials in his selection.  The smartest choice would be former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, according to left-leaning independent Matt Sky.  "You have a guy with executive experience, he has some foreign policy experience, he's been incredibly loyal to the Romney campaign," said the free-lancer from New York. "He's not super exciting, but he's not going to overshadow the candidate either."  Adding excitement to Romney's campaign was a common refrain sung by most iReporters, but there was disagreement as to which candidate would bring forth the energy.  Rubio would be up to the challenge, but he could also be "a true jewel to the Romney campaign," said Nicholas Pegues.  "I believe he would excite young people to vote Republican more, and Sen. Rubio would bring a great wealth of knowledge to the Romney campaign for cultural diversity," the Memphis, Tennessee, native said. "He'll just be a great access for minorities in the Republican Party."  Rick Huffman said he would also like Rubio to run alongside Romney, mostly because the senator holds strong conservative values.  "I think Rubio is very articulate, intelligent, great personality, charismatic and most of all, very conservative," said the St. Joseph, Michigan, resident. "He will make Joe Biden look like a dunce in debates."  
 Washington The National Mall's Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial will be ready for events later this month commemorating the 50th anniversary of his "I Have a Dream Speech."  Sandblasting on King's monument was completed Thursday night after delays over a company not having proper insurance.  The National Park Service's Historic Preservation Training Center ended up doing the work, said spokeswoman Carol Johnson. The park service, which was not initially aware that the sandblasting would be required, is "very happy" with the completed project, she said.  The remainder of the scaffolding will be taken down in coming days.  The completion of the work follows the removal of a controversial written message inscribed on the memorial's side.  The memorial had originally included a paraphrase from the famed Civil Rights leader's "Drum Major" speech that read: "I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness."  In 2011, famed poet Maya Angelou, a friend of King, pointed out that the statue took the original quote out of context in a manner that she said made King look arrogant.  Americans urged to live MLK's ideals at memorial dedication  Two months before he was assassinated in 1968, King in fact said: "If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter."  The work at the site is expected to cost between $700,000 and $800,000, according to Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. The money is coming not from taxpayer dollars but from a fund established for repairs.  The memorial, designed by Chinese artist Lei Yixin, opened in the summer of 2011. It features a large statue of King carved into the centerpiece "Stone of Hope," a large block set apart from the memorial's "Mountain of Despair," from which it appears to emerge.

Hong Kong A Hindu holy man castrated himself in India Wednesday following the arrest of popular preacher Asaram Bapu, revered by millions across the country for his sermons on enlightenment. Police have charged the 72-year old guru with raping a 16-year-old schoolgirl at one of his ashrams, or religious centers, in August.  Authorities in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh found Baba Premdas, a 60-year old follower of Bapu, bleeding at his home in Amethi from apparently self-inflicted wounds, city police chief Alankrita Singh told CNN. Premdas was admitted to a local hospital and then taken to a bigger health facility for surgery where his condition "is stable", said Singh.  Asked whether his act was related to the arrest of Asaram Bapu, Singh added, "We have heard such things, but all this is unconfirmed."  "Some say it was because of Bapu's arrest," said Singh to AFP earlier, "some say it was because he feared ending up in Bapu's situation. No one knows."  Bapu has denied the sexual assault allegations leveled by the teenage girl and her parents, both devotees of the guru. The elderly preacher has also claimed he is physically incapable of rape but police say medical tests show him to be in good shape.  "The team of doctors is saying he is perfectly, medically, mentally and physically fit," said Ajayal Lamba, Deputy Commissioner of Police in Jodhpur.  Bapu, also referred to as the "godman" in local Indian media, is currently in jail awaiting trial after a court rejected his bail plea earlier this week, public prosecutor Anand Purohit told CNN. The prosecution plans to present a detailed dossier of the charges in the trial soon, he said.  This month's unfolding rape case against Bapu is just the latest in a series of sexual assault incidents in India since late 2012 that have gained high-profile attention both for their frequency and ferocity.  It was the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in New Delhi last December that galvanized Indian society and the media in particular, to examine the pervasive incidence of rape and other forms of violence against women. The barbarity of the crime ignited a wide-ranging discussion across all levels of the Indian media and prompted multiple debates in the national and regional assemblies. Stung into action by public outrage, the government instituted new laws and crucially stricter punishments, which includes the death penalty when victims are killed or left in a vegetative state.  Furthermore in a sharp departure with previous practice, predatory behavior such as voyeurism, stalking and groping can now lead to arrest and punishment. India's court system is now making greater use of fast-track trials to prosecute the most heinous and high-profile crimes against women. Local and national media have maintained their spotlight on sexual assaults and other violence against women, leading to a torrent of disturbing reports following last December's horrific rape incident.  In March, at least five men from a local tribe gang-raped a Swiss woman camping with her husband in a forest in India's Datia district. A court convicted six men to life in prison four months later.  In April, a 4-year-old Indian girl was raped by a 35-year-old man in India's central Maharashtra state. The girl suffered brain damage and was in a coma for two weeks before dying from cardiac arrest.  And in June, at least three men gang-raped a 31-year-old American tourist in northern India after she visited the Vashishth Temple after midnight. She accepted a ride from the group after failing to find a taxi. They drove her to a wooded area where they assaulted her.  While such incidents have been covered extensively by international news media, an even larger number of cases are only reported in domestic Indian news outletsand an unknown number simply go unreported.  Just this week in local media, the Times of India reported two men gang-raped a 27-year-old woman who had gone to a local dairy in northern Uttar Pradesh state, the Hindustan Times reported at least six to seven girls were lured to and raped at a deserted steel mill south of Mumbai over the past half year, and the Indian Express reported the story of a 14-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by two people over several months in western Gujarat state. Villagers discovered the girl was pregnant but later miscarried twin babies.  According to India's National Crime Records Bureau, the country recorded 24,923 cases of reported rape in 2012a 57% rise in reported cases since 2003. This number is widely considered to be extremely underreported for a country of more than 1 billion people. The United States, with a population of more than 310 million, recorded 270,000 cases of rape in 2010, the most recent year for which national rape statistics are available.

 Madrid Spanish Interior Minister Antonio Camacho warned Friday that although the Basque separatist group ETA has declared an end to violence, the most difficult task still lies aheadensuring no Spaniards suffer the threat of terror attacks in the future.  His remarks come a day after ETA announced a "definitive cessation of its armed activity" in a statement published on the website of Gara, a newspaper the group has used to convey messages in the past.  ETA is blamed for hundreds of deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent Basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern Spain and southwestern France.  Speaking Friday on Spanish National Television, Camacho said: "We have completed a first part of our task, (but) there remains the more complex one, guaranteeing through the strict enforcement of our laws that never again will any generation of Spaniards have to suffer on their backs the weight of a barbarity that slows down our progress and compromises our future."  He said ETA had been defeated "by the tireless and unstoppable work of the police and the civil guard" and that as a result it had been forced to declare an end to violence without achieving a single one of its aims.  The security services had achieved that outcome "with tenacity, with work, with dedication, and above all, with a lot of suffering," he said.  U.S. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday that ETA's announcement "holds out the prospect of a historic step toward peace, although there is a long road ahead to realize this promise."  He paid tribute to the victims of ETA violence, adding: "We recognize the courage of the Spanish government and the Spanish people in their enduring efforts to advance democracy and freedom in Spain and around the world."  "The Spanish people have endured over 40 years of violence at the hands of ETA," said the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. "The secretary-general shares in the hope that ETA is committed to bringing this tragic chapter for Spain to an end."  European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso hailed the development as "a truly historic moment which ends years of terror and attacks on Spanish society."  The news "marks the culmination of years of unceasing efforts in the fight against terrorism," he said, congratulating Spain on its efforts to combat ETA.  Police have cracked down in recent years on ETA in Spain and France, leaving it operationally weak.  There have been numerous statements from the Basque group calling for talks or a peace process of some sort, but all falling short of declaring a definitive end to violence.  The Spanish government said that since ETA has broken cease-fires in the past; only an authoritative statement that it is putting down its arms for good will do.  Thursday's announcement followed a recent push for the group to abandon violence permanently. That effort was led by international figures who include Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams of Northern Ireland and former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.  In a nationally televised address hours after the announcement was posted, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero termed ETA's announcement as being of "transcendental importance" and a "victory for democracy."  "Ours will be a democracy without terrorism, but not without memory," Zapatero said, referring to 829 people killed by ETA and their families.  The prime minister praised Spanish police, Civil Guard personnel, the intelligence agency and judicial authorities "who have contributed to this end." Zapatero also singled out Francewhich has traditionally been used as a rearguard base for ETAand its president, Nicolas Sarkozy, for their assistance.  The prime minister said that it would be up to Spain's next governmentwhich will be formed after parliamentary elections on November 20to lead the peace process.  In remarks Thursday night at their respective political party headquarters in Madrid, the two main contenders to replace ZapateroAlfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the candidate from Zapatero's Socialist Party, and Mariano Rajoy, leader of the opposition People's Partycheered the development but did not detail what they would do next if they were to become prime minister.  In its statement Thursday, ETAwhich is listed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Unionoutlined why now was the right time to make such a declaration.  "A new political time is emerging in the Basque Country," ETA said. "We have a historic opportunity to find a just and democratic solution for the centuries-old political conflict."  The group then added that "dialogue and agreement" should predominate "over violence and repression."  ETA urged the Spanish and French governments to conduct "direct dialogue" aimed at addressing outstanding issues while calling upon fellow Basques to commit to such a process.  CNN's Al Goodman and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.

From bikinis and tank tops to short shorts, summer fashion calls for a whole lot of skin.  When you're not feeling your beach bod best, time to break out the caftans, those long, loose garments with wide sleeves. These robe-like gowns have transcended their ancient origins to become summer fashion staples with universal appeal thanks to their forgiving silhouette, whether you're Elizabeth Taylor or Mary Kate Olsen.  "They're extremely comfortable, and they're extremely flattering to many body types," said fashion historian Valerie Steele, director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.  Maybe your fashion-forward mom donned a caftan to host pool parties or to swing by the neighborhood shindig. Or maybe you caught "Mad Men" star Christina Hendricks wearing one on "The Tonight Show," describing caftans as her "go-to" item around the house and inspiring one of the best theme parties ever: caftans and casseroles.  Depending on what they're made of, caftans can be worn any time of the year, Steele said. But "we tend to see them as summer wear" because they are one of few clothing items that keep you cool in warm weather without having to bare a lot of skin.  Through the years, designers from Yves Saint Laurent to Rachel Zoe have reinterpreted the caftan in sync with the styles of the time. But what makes a caftan distinct from a flowing dress essentially has remained consistent: a T-shaped garment reaching the ankles that can be pulled over the head. From there, the rest is up to artistic interpretation.  The caftanor kaftanhas come a long way since the early days of the Persian empire, when soldiers wore them under chain mail armor, "reputedly impenetrable by the enemy's sword" thanks to a weave of heavy cloth padded with silk floss, according to Columbia University's Encyclopedia Iranica.  The word itself is Persian and translates to a battle garment worn by soldiers, said Niloo Paydar, curator of textile and fashion arts at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, which houses one of the country's largest collections of Islamic textiles. References to caftans appear in Persian art and literature as early as 600 B.C., and revered Persian poet Ferdowsi mentions them in his seminal work, "Shahnameh," or the Persian "Book of Kings," she said.  Beyond the battlefield, anyone from the peasant class to the upper class could enjoy caftans thanks to their simple structure, which allowed for embellishment and adornment depending on one's means, Paydar said. Much like today, the caftan was worn as a length of draped fabric with sleeves, open or closed, that could be wrapped around the body with a sash or belt.  Arab conquerors introduced caftans to North Africa, where different groups interpreted them according to their religious and cultural traditions, and European imperialism led to cultural contact with the East, allowing for caftans to infiltrate the Western wardrobe, said Steele. Ambassadors to the Ottoman Court in Istanbul received gifts of caftans as early as the 17th century that played well into the era's imperialistic obsession with "Orientalism," she said.  "The English in particular liked to have themselves portrayed in Ottoman dress, so there are a number of portraits of them in caftans," she said.  The style evolved in 18th-century Europe into ankle-length gowns that open in the front known as banyans, Steele said. In the 20th century, when European imperialism opened up North Africa to Western artists and tastemakers, European designers like Paul Poiret and Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo derived inspiration from Moroccan and Algerian styles of caftans to create evening coats and dresses for western women.  When wealthy jet-setters and superstars took off for places like Morocco and India in the 1960s, they brought back Eastern fashion traditions along with spiritualism, Steele said. Halston and Yves Saint Laurent adopted the style into a symbol of bohemian elite that trickled down to mainstream fashion in the 1970s.  The caftan continues to change with the times, with embellishments and diverse patterns offering a more feminine silhouette. Now, as then, the drapey dresses appeal to diverse audiences, from starlets on the red carpet to diplomats at State Dinners to summer music festival-goers.  Would you wear a caftan?

 (EW.com)Considering the deep bench of A-list talent involved, Ridley Scott's new Southwestern noir, "The Counselor," is a jaw-dropping misfire.  The dialogue is laughably pretentious, the plotting is virtually nonexistent, and the performances are so broad and cartoony that you keep wondering if it's all some sort of prank.  Reteaming with Ridley Scott after the disappointing "Prometheus," Michael Fassbender stars as a smooth, naive lawyer operating in the moral gray zone along the border between Texas and Mexico. It's a godforsaken land where drugs are cheap and life is cheaper.  After years defending crooked clients there, Fassbender's ''Counselor'' finds all of the easy money too tempting to resist. So he sells his soul and saddles up with a ring of flashy bad guys for a big drug-smuggling score.  Box office preview: 'Bad Grandpa' ready to take down 'Gravity'  There's Javier Bardem as Reiner, a spiky haired playboy who looks like he picked his wardrobe from a Siegfried and Roy yard sale; Brad Pitt as Westray, a charismatically mysterious stringy-haired hood who speaks in cryptic riddles; and Cameron Diaz as Malkina, a sex-crazed harpy covered in tattooed spots to match her pet cheetahs. (This is the film's subtle idea of character development.)  For all of her man-eating efforts in the film, Diaz is punished with one of the most wince-inducing scenes in years  a spread-eagle masturbation spectacle performed on the hood of Bardem's yellow Ferrari that I'd say has to be seen to be believed. But I wouldn't want to encourage anyone to cough up ten bucks to sit through it.  If the film's posse of ethically shady villains seems right out of a bad Cormac McCarthy novel, that's because it more or less is. "The Counselor" is the celebrated bard of the borderland's first feature-film screenplay. And as Fassbender's drug deal goes sour, putting his fiance (Penlope Cruz) in harm's way, he's forced to listen to a lot of poorly-sketched characters wander on screen and deliver stilted metaphorical speeches about greed and the evil that men do.  'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' pushed to January  All of this may have seemed fine and dandy on the page. But I suspect that McCarthy is about to find out the hard way that writing novels and writing screenplays are two very different things. In "No Country For Old Men," the Coen brothers wisely stripped the author's doomed tough-guy dialogue and injected it with a stiff dose of harrowing naturalism. But operating on his own here, McCarthy's unchecked macho arias leave you sitting there slack-jawed, wondering if he has any idea how people talk in real life.  Scott doesn't do him any favors either. The director surrounds the garishly painted characters in excessive dollops of glitzy opulence, hammer-to-the-skull symbolism, and sex scenes that are as embarrassing as they are un-erotic  the film's paranoid view of women comes off as downright Neanderthal.  I suppose the only good thing than can be said of a movie as bad as "The Counselor" is that its existence is a reminder of just how right Hollywood usually gets it. Big honking bombs as bad as this one are like solar eclipses. Rare and not to be looked at directly.  Grade: D+  See the original story on EW.com.

 A video that shows the beheading of American Steven Sotloff was delivered as a "second message to America" to halt airstrikes in Iraq, following through on a threat to kill the journalist.  In the video posted Tuesday online, Sotloff saysin a message surely scripted by his captors that he is "paying the price" for U.S. military intervention.  The intelligence community in the United States is working to confirm the authenticity of the video, and the journalist's family was waiting for that formal authentication that Sotloff has been killed.  "The family knows of the video and is grieving privately," family spokesman Barak Barfi said.  Who is ISIS?  The killing of Sotloff follows a threat last month by ISIS made during the videotaped beheading of American journalist James Foley. The latest video threatens the life of another man.  A masked ISIS figure in the new video speaks to U.S. President Barack Obama, telling him, "Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."  The Islamic State has thrived and mutated during the civil war in Syria. It swept into Iraq in June, seizing large swaths of the country's Sunni-dominated northern and western provinces.  Obama ordered targeted airstrikes in Iraq to begin in early August after ISIS fighters began targeting ethnic Yazidis and launching attacks toward the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil.  ISIS appeared to date the execution video of Sotloff, referencing specific U.S. military actions in recent days, including U.S. airstrikes that helped over the weekend to break the siege of Amerlia northern Iraqi town home to thousands of minority Shiite Turkmen.  Intelligence officials are analyzing the video, trying to answer some key questions, a senior U.S. administration official said.  Among the questions, the official said: When was it shot? Where was it shot? Is the killer in the Sotloff video the same one in the Foley video?  Until they answer those questions, the official said the administration does not want to speculate.  It's believed ISIS is still holding a "small number" of Americans hostage, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors  ISIS: 'Back off and leave our people alone'  In the new video, the militant threatens the life of the man, who is shown kneeling with the militant standing behind him.  "We take this opportunity to warn those governments who've entered this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone," the militant says.  CNN could not immediately confirm when he was taken captive.  But the Washington Post reported he was an aid worker abducted in March 2013. The newspaper, citing unnamed aid workers involved in efforts to gain his release, said he was abducted near a refugee camp in the northern Syrian province of Idlib.  British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters he was aware of reports about the video and called Sotloff's killing "an absolutely disgusting and despicable act."  Who was Sotloff?  Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public. Out of public view, the family and government agencies had been trying to gain his release for the past year.  Last week, Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill her son.  "Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson," she said. "He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak."  Her plea was met with taunting responses on social media by ISIS supporters.  Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians including the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies including "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Big Lebowski" as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a "stand-up philosopher from Miami."  He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and The Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkeyamong other countriesand eventually Syria.  Editor Nancy Gibbs said the magazine's staff is "shocked and deeply saddened" by the reports of his death.  "He gave his life so readers would have access to information from some of the most dangerous places in the world," she said. "Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family."  Sotloff brings the number of journalists killed in Syria to at least 70, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.  More than 80 have been kidnapped in Syria since the civil war began, with many going unpublicized, the group said.  "We condemn in the strongest terms possible the murder of journalist Steven Sotloff. He, like James Foley, went to Syria to tell a story. They were civilians, not representatives of any government. Their murders are war crimes and those who committed them must be brought to justice swiftly," CPJ said.  Obama on ISISNo strategy yet  Response from the White House  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the administration "has obviously been watching very carefully since this threat against Mr. Sotloff's life was originally made a few weeks ago."  A top U.S. State Department official told CNN's Christiane Amanpour to "stay tuned" on U.S. plans to combat the organization.  "We are putting the features in place, developing a broad regional coalition, a broad international coalition, working to get a new Iraqi government stood up, working to get our plans in place. So stay tuned," said Brett McGurk, the deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iraq.  Obama, who was briefed on the videotaped execution of Sotloff, came under fire from Republicans and Democrats who called on the President to take stronger against ISIS, also known as ISIL.  The criticism came a week after Obama said, "We don't have a strategy yet" to deal with ISIS in Syria. Obama said he has asked America's top defense officials to prepare "a range of options."  "Mr. President, if you can't come up with a strategy, at least tell us what the goal is regarding ISIL," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, said ISIS must be stopped.  "We must use every tool at our disposal, short of introducing ground forces in combat roles, to put an end to the threat they pose to our national security," she said.  Opinion: Foley is a reminder why freelance reporting is so dangerous

Washington Additional U.S. military advisers are now on the ground in northern Iraq with the Obama administration considering a possible air evacuation of thousands of minority Yazidis under threat from Islamic State militants and trapped on Mount Sinjar.  President Barack Obama ordered nearly 130 advisers to Irbil to assess the situation, and it's now likely that a small number of them will travel to the mountain area to get a first-hand look at what might be possible.  The new group comprised of Marines and special forces adds to the hundreds of other American advisers already in the country advising Iraqi troops in their fight against Sunni militants from the Islamic State, an al Qaeda off-shoot formally known as ISIS.  The group has waged a brutal campaign while seizing large areas of territory this year in Iraq. It's aiming to establish a caliphate.  Hundreds of thousands of Iraq's ethnic and religious minorities have fled ISIS fighters. Nowhere is the crisis more evident than the Sinjar Mountains, where an estimated 40,000 minority Yazidis are hiding.  The plight of the Yazidis, coupled with the ISIS assault against Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region, prompted the United States to begin targeted airstrikes over the past several days. The aim, according to Obama, is to help protect U.S. personnel in the area and to destroy ISIS positions around the mountains to ease the threat to minority groups.  Air evacuation option  Obama has also authorized humanitarian airdrops to help the Yazidis, and is now weighing an air evacuation, a U.S. official told CNN on Wednesday.  Focusing on a possible air optionrather than a ground oneis due to initial indications that going by land would take too long would up the risk to the Yazidis, according to the official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and asked not to be named.  In addition, many of the stranded Yazidis are in poor medical condition to make a lengthy journey, the official said. However, American officials did say that a ground option is still under consideration as well.  If an air operation is proposed and approved by Obama, it would require putting U.S. ground troops both on the mountain and at a nearby airfield, the official said.  The operation will be characterized as a short-term humanitarian mission, not a combat one. But U.S. troops would have the right to defend themselves against any ISIS attacks.  As part of an air evacuation, American forces would establish a security corridor around the area to try to provide airspace for helicopters and other aircraft to pick up people.  The newly arrived advisers would form the beginning of a joint task force to carry out such an operation, the official said.  They would work to develop procedures for rescuing and then processing people taken off the mountain. But there are still several unresolved questionssuch as, where will the Yazidis be flown to?  Asked about a potential evacuation operation on CNN's "New Day," Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said he didn't "want to get too far out in front" of any potential scenarios.  "We shouldn't be jumping to a conclusion right now that there is or won't be a rescue operation in particular," he said.

Australia has long prided itself on its commitment to fairness. It is a signatory to a range of international conventions intended to protect the vulnerable and has in the past provided sanctuary for those seeking refuge, most notably in the wake of the Vietnam War.  In recent years, however, successive Australian governments have adopted increasingly punitive measures to deter asylum seekers from coming to Australia by boat. This is despite Australia hosting relatively low numbers of refugees.  Now the Australian government has adopted a military response to the arrival of boats: its Operation Sovereign Borders is led by a three-star general and implemented by Australian Navy and Customs personnel. Boats attempting to bring asylum seekers to Australian territory are intercepted and either towed or escorted back to Indonesian waters. If an intercepted boat is unseaworthy, Australia may transfer asylum seekers to lifeboats, with limited provisions, and release them close to Indonesian waters. They then have no choice but to return to Indonesia.  In implementing this extraordinary policy, Australia has entered Indonesian waters on a number of occasions, sparking protest from Indonesia over incursions into its sovereign territory.  Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Australia's policy is its failure to identify and protect refugees among the asylum seekers it intercepts at sea, despite its obligation under the Refugee Convention to protect refugees from being returned to persecution.  As Indonesia is not a party to the Refugee Convention, Australia has no assurance that refugees returned to Indonesia will not be deported to their home countries where they face harm.  Offshore processing  A further troubling aspect of the policy is the refusal to process the claims of those arriving by boat in Australia. Asylum seekers are transferred to the Pacific island nations of Nauru and PNG's Manus Island for detention and processing within 48 hours of arriving in Australian territory.  The detention centers on Nauru and Manus Island are grossly overcrowded, lack adequate health services, are prone to outbreaks of disease and have inadequate water and sanitation. Asylum seekers have engaged in self-harm and attempted suicide. The centers have been criticized by Amnesty International and the UNHCR for not meeting required protection standards.  In fact, the Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Control has conceded that Australia is unable to guarantee the safety of every asylum seeker in the PNG detention facility. The stark reality is that a young Iranian asylum seeker, Reza Berati, was murdered on Manus Island in February 2014. Asylum seekers have reported living in constant fear in detention and staying awake in shifts to watch over each other; and many asylum seekers have suffered serious injuries there.  The situation in the Nauru detention center is equally grave. Asylum seekers burnt down a significant portion of the detention facility in July 2013, there have been allegations of sexual assault and the UNHCR has highlighted the gross inadequacies of the detention centre, particularly for children.  Who's responsible?  Disingenuously, Australia has attempted to argue that it only plays a support role in the facilities and has no responsibility for asylum seekers in these detention centers because Nauru and PNG are sovereign nations.  However, Australia has clear power and effective control in the facilities. It is responsible for selecting and transferring asylum seekers to the centers and for their day-to-day operation.  Australia is also solely responsible for the high financial costs of running these detention centers. It pays for the operation and service provision at the centers, pays a visa fee in Nauru for every asylum seeker detained or resettled there and is paying the legal costs PNG is incurring to fight the Constitutional challenge to the Manus Island detention center.  Australia's clear power and effective control in the centers means that it has certain responsibilities under international law to the detained asylum seekers. By failing to determine the suitability of detention for each individual detainee and exposing asylum seekers to unacceptable conditions, Australia is arbitrarily detaining asylum seekers and subjecting them to "cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment," according to Amnesty International.  Such treatment violates its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Further, the current indefinite detention of children in Nauru places Australia in violation of its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Operation Sovereign Borders targets asylum seekers who come to Australia by boat, in violation of Australia's obligation under the Refugee Convention to refrain from punishing refugees for their mode of arrival in a country.  Resettlement plans  Australia has vowed not to resettle any of the refugees it sends to Nauru and PNG. Nauru has agreed to issue five-year visas to refugees processed in Nauru and PNG has also indicated a willingness to resettle refugees processed in that country. In addition, Australia has reached in-principle agreement with Cambodia to resettle some of the refugees processed in Nauru.  Relying on impoverished nations, which may not be in a position to protect the rights or safety of refugees, is deeply concerning. The Australian government's unwillingness to resettle refugees in Australia is another reminder of the deliberate harshness of its asylum policies.  These extreme measures are intended to make asylum in Australia an unattractive option for the vulnerable people who may wish to seek protection. They repudiate the country's reputation for fairness and commitment to human rights.  
 Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, who was due in court Thursday for his trial, has been hospitalized after falling ill, his lawyer told CNN.  He was taken to a hospital on his doctor's orders, lawyer Ahmad Raza Kasuri said. His trial was subsequently postponed until Monday.  Asiya Ishaq, a supporter and leader of the All Pakistan Muslim League, said the former President had been feeling pressure on his chest since Wednesday evening and was not well.  When asked if he will go to Dubai for treatment, she said that "Musharraf will not leave Pakistan." Ishaq also said that as far as she knows, "Musharraf has got three arteries blocked and is currently undergoing angiography," an artery-scanning procedure.  Atiqa Odho, a Pakistani actor who's a former leader of the APML, a party that Musharraf launched in 2010, offered support for Musharraf on Thursday.  "I pray for President Musharraf's health and long life," she said. "It is painful to see how heartbroken a great and brave man is, due to being let down by people who claimed to be his supporters."  Musharraf could be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on charges of treason. Prosecutors say he violated Pakistan's constitution by imposing emergency military rule in 2007.  The former President ruled the country from 1999 to 2008.  He went into exile in 2008 but came back to Pakistan last year, intending to run in the country's national elections. But his plans unraveled as he became entangled in a web of court cases relating to his time in power.  The accusations  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has accused Musharraf of illegally abrogating on the constitution in November 2007. That month, Musharraf declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge and blacked out independent TV outlets.  Musharraf said he did so to stabilize the country and to fight rising Islamist extremism. The action drew sharp criticism from the United States and democracy advocates. Pakistanis openly called for his ouster.  Under pressure from the West, he later lifted the state of emergency and promised elections.  Musharraf stepped down in August 2008 as the governing coalition began taking steps to impeach him.  A spokeswoman for Musharraf said in November that he is willing to face all charges against him.  "Gen. Musharraf has full faith in the judiciary and trusts the legal system to clear his name," Aasia Ishaque told CNN. "He is a man of his word, and he will let the court decide his fate."  CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.

Some people might call 17-year-old Joshua Hanson one the luckiest people on the planet. Others might call him crazy.  I-Reporter Joshua Hanson offered a look at the Mark IV helmet from his "Legendary Limited Edition Halo 3."  Hanson waited more than eight hours outside a Woodbury, Minnesota, video game store on Monday evening to be the first in his town to buy one of the most anticipated video games in history"Halo 3."  Watch Hanson buying the game amid cheers   The final chapter in Microsoft's acclaimed video game series hit shelves at the stroke of midnight Monday in similar stores across the nation. The Xbox 360 game is expected to shatter entertainment sales records within its first 24 hours of release.  Hanson is not alone in his loyalty to the game, and his belief in "Halo's" power to entertain and inspire.  We asked other CNN.com readers for their take on "Halo 3." Some offered comparisons to "Star Wars" and "Harry Potter," while others discussed compelling new graphics and features. Below is a selection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity.  Curt Otto of Springfield, Virginia I waited in line for two-and-half hours to get this game at midnight. I purchased the Legendary Edition of this game at a hefty $130! Totally worth it! Although I haven't slept since yesterday and I'm currently at work and very tired, I would do it all over again for "Halo." This is the GREATEST game ever crafted by the hand of man. If you own a 360, buy this game. If you don't own a 360, buy one and go buy this game! The single player is incredible and the online multiplayer is MIND BLOWING! Totally worth $130!!!  Tony Nash of Buffalo, New York  I've been playing "Halo" since the very first game came out in 2001. After getting the brand new Box with a copy of "Halo" and throwing myself into the game, I quickly realized this wasn't a standard gaming experience. It was something much, much more. The game had a great attitude and unique art style. Along with great audio and environments that brought the worlds to life. It also had the most addictive, natural, and fun game play I've ever experienced. It also contained a well written, downright intriguing story. Getting together with friends to play the multiplayer portion of the game only cemented this title's epic status. Then came November 2004, when, of course, a friend and I were in the lines for the Midnight release of "Halo 2." It is no joke; "Halo" is more than just a game. Now, I plan on "finishing the fight" as soon as I leave work. I had "Halo 3" pre-ordered for about a month before it came out. Hey, after all, it's good to keep the kid inside you alive and well!  Cody Chmelik of Clearwater, Florida  "Halo 3" is the most anticipated event since the trial of O.J., but the only difference is that "Halo" isn't disappointing. "Halo 3" was the best game I have ever played. The levels are choreographed perfectly, the players look real and the game play is phenomenal. I recommend this game to players of all ages.  Wayne S. of Colorado Springs, Colorado  "Halo" is not just a game, it's a lifestyle, a booming culture of millions of Xbox fans who eat, sleep and live "Halo." "Halo" has jumped started the major league gaming industry and will continue to do so with "Halo 3." I will be getting my copy of "Halo 3" at midnight and plan on playing it for days straight. I have played the beta and let me tell you: This is the best video game of the year by far and will be played by the masses for years to come just like "Halo 2."  Brian Baker of Beatrice, Nebraska I am 30 years old, and for my 30th birthday my wife pre-ordered "Halo 3" for me as a birthday present. The 6 month wait for the present/game didn't bother me one bit. The story that is "Halo" is something that people can easily identify with. The late '70s to late '90s had Luke Skywalker and the alpha-male heroes of "Star Wars." The Generation X, Y and Z now have an alpha-male hero of their own in the Master Chief that they can relate to, or use to associate different attitudes and help instill values of patriotism. In this case, patriotism is not for just a country, but an entire planet and species. I am a very patriotic person, a veteran and a father and see the values that may hide below the surface in this Trilogy, which is why I'm a "Halo" fan.  Jarrod Leda of Tarentum, Pennsylvania  Despite the hype, I am very excited for this [new game]. Some question why "Halo" got so big, as there are other good shooters very similar to it. I think, like "Star Wars" before it, it just got things right. And now, it's become iconic: the characters, the universe, it's something everyone who loves games can talk about and share. The game allows things that most other games would not; the physics and mechanics of the engine are great. And it plays flawlessly on X-box live. I can't wait.  Vivek Patel of Albany, New York  "Halo" can be compared to "Harry Potter" in that when you start reading or playing you have to finish. The third installment gamers will wait in line for hours; even bleed to finally finish the fight that was started years ago. To me "Halo 3" isn't even advertised that much, and they will achieve their records by sheer popularity.  Alessandro Miglio of Walnut Creek, California  The "Halo" franchise is like a budding "Star Trek" phenomenon. There are a lot of hardcore fans, like myself, who are not just really into the games, but read all the books and comics that expand the universe. We even write tons of theories and fan fictions with all the potential created by the "Haloverse." I consider myself a "Trekkie" of "Halo," loud and proud. E-mail to a friend  
 Doha, Qatar CNN's Nic Robertson had tough questions for Hamas's political leader.  Khaleed Meshaal is known as Hamas' external deal-maker and a fund-raiser from supporters in the region, a role the 58-year-old has held since 2004.  Robertson interviewed Meshaal over the weekend in Qatar, where he lives. Here are some highlights from the interview.  Firing rockets from neighborhoods  Robertson asked Meshaal why Hamas is firing rockets from civilian neighborhoods. Meshaal answered with numbers.  "How many Israeli civilians have our rockets killed? Israel knows the number. Meanwhile, how many Palestinians has Israel killed? Up until now have been killed 1700 people, while we have killed 63 soldiers. We kill soldiers, while they kill civilians."  (The Palestinian death toll as of Monday was at least 1,856, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Sixty-four Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel had been killed, according to Israeli officials.)  Robertson then asked Meshaal to respond to critics who say Hamas is using civilian deaths to gain international sympathy.  Meshaal called that a lie and said Hamas is not seeking international sympathy through its own victims.  "It is unfortunate that the American administration and President Obama have adopted the Israeli narrative, which is a lie. Hamas sacrifices itself for its people and does not use its people as human shields to protect its soldiers. The fighter, just like the soldier in the army, his job is to protect the people, and not to sacrifice the people for himself."  Hamas' cause  Meshaal said Israel has a powerful military but the Palestinians will triumph.  "We are stronger than they are in the justness of our cause. We are the rightful owners of the land, and they are the thieves of the land. We are the victims and they are the murderers. But despite this, we might not win a battle or two completely, but at the end we will win the war. Our steadfastness is a victory. For us to kill their soldiers while they kill our civilians is also a victory for the Palestinian cause and Hamas."  Robertson pressed Meshaal on the point, asking how this can be a victory for Hamas and its cause when so many Palestinians are dying.  "Our people are convinced today that the only way to get rid of the occupation and establish their state is through resistance."  Cease-fire  Robertson wanted to know whether Hamas would ever accept Israel's right to exist and agree to a cease-fire.  "We're ready for a cease-fire. We want the war to end today, and we did not attack anyone. It was (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu who transferred the crisis of what happened in the West Bank to Gaza. He's the one responsible for this. We're ready to stop this war." (The killing of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank triggered the current crisis.)  Egyptian talks  Hamas has agreed to cease-fires through Egyptian mediators "many times" since 2003, Meshaal said.  "The Israelis, the Egyptians and the American administration know (this), otherwise John Kerry would not have intervened this time nor (former Secretary of State) Mrs. Hillary Clinton in 2012. They know that Hamas is very credible in that if its leadership promised something, it will fulfill its promise, and the fighters on the ground will follow that."  He said he is still willing to engage in talks with Egyptians acting as the go-betweens.  "Regardless what the others' positions (are), we stated that we are ready to go as a Palestinian delegation to Cairo in order to talk to the Egyptians so they can hold indirect talks between us and the Israelis, so we can reach an agreement that will address our Palestinian demands, headed by ending the siege of Gaza. Then cease-fire can take place. We announced this position before and we are still committed to it."  Peace negotiations  Hamas is not to blame for the lack of a solution, he said.  "We the Palestinian people have, since 1948, have listened to the international community and U.N. and international regulations, in the hope they end the aggression against us. But the international community failed in ending the Israeli occupation and failed in helping our people to have self-determination and have its own state. Even the latest (peace) negotiations, between (Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud) Abbas and Netanyahu with Kerry as the broker, were sabotaged by Netanyahu."  Calls for cease-fires  Meshaal said he would support a temporary cease-fire for humanitarian purposes. But he would only support a long-term cease-fire if Israel changes its policy restricting the movement of goods and people into Gaza.  "There are two kinds of cease-fires: There is the humanitarian cease-fire, like 72-hour cease-fire that was meant to help and aid our people getting food, water, and help collecting the bodies. As far as the sustainable cease-fire, this is connected to an agreement accepted by the two parties that will guarantee our Palestinian demands headed by lifting the siege on Gaza."  What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza?  CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

A Jewish human rights organization on Monday called for Thailand's Christian leaders to condemn a parade at the Sacred Heart School in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in which participating students wearing Nazi uniforms performed "Sieg Heil" salutes.  The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization based in Los Angeles, denounced the event, saying it was "glorifying Nazis."  Photographs of the parade show participants carrying a Swastika flag, performing Nazi salutes and wearing SS uniforms, while others dressed as Adolf Hitler complete with toothbrush moustache.  Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said the images made it clear that the event could not have taken place without the knowledge and cooperation of the school administration.  "It is difficult to calculate the hurt such a display inflicted on survivors of the Nazi Holocaust and the families of all victims of Nazism. There can be no justification for such an outrage to emanate from place of learning," he said.  The Simon Wiesenthal Center urged those responsible for the school to take immediate action against the individuals who promoted and facilitated the event.  Cooper said that a similar parade took place in 2007 at a school in Bangkok in which 200 students participated, and that more recently, members of Thai rock band Slur donned Nazi uniforms in a music video.  On Wednesday, the school's website posted a letter by its director expressing an apology.  "We, the entire Sacred Heart School [personnel] are deeply saddened by this incident."  The letter explained that the sports day activity involved groups being differentiated by colorsthe "Red" group having used Nazi symbols.  CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.  
 Dueling theories of how the universe was created got a split decision Friday night from the Texas Board of Education, which required examination of "all sides of scientific evidence" in new science standards, but rejected language requiring teachers to teach the "strengths and weaknesses" of scientific theories.  A woman stands in front of a mural depicting the development from ape to computer user.  The debate pitted proponents of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution against supporters of religion-based theories of intelligent design, or creationism.  "Science loses. Texas loses, and the kids lose because of this," board chairman Don McLeroy, a creationist, told the Dallas Morning News.  A final 13-2 vote approved language that will be printed in textbooks beginning in 2011 and remain there for 10 years, CNN affiliate KPRC-TV in Houston reported:  "In all fields of science, analyze, evaluate, and critique scientific explanations by using empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and experimental observation and testing, including examining all sides of scientific evidence of those explanations so as to encourage critical thinking by the students."  Earlier, the board rejected two sections written by McLeroy on identical 8-7 votes, the Dallas Morning News said.  One section required teachers to "analyze, review, and critique scientific explanations, including hypotheses and theories, as to their strengths and weaknesses using scientific evidence and information," and the other required high school students to study the "sufficiency or insufficiency" of key principles of evolution.  Opponents were pleased with the board's action on McLeroy's sections, but unsatisfied with the final result.  "The phrase has been an open door to religious indoctrination in public schools," Mark Finkelstein, a lawyer with the Anti-Defamation League, told KPRC, referring to the "strengths and weaknesses" phrase in the material voted down.  "This document still has plenty of potential footholds for creationist attacks on evolution to make their way into Texas classrooms," Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, told the Dallas Morning News.  She predicted battles over textbooks in the coming years, a prediction McLeroy bolstered.  Publishers, he said, will "have to get their textbooks approved by us in a few years."  The size of the textbook market in Texas gives it influence nationwide, as publishers adapt their material to its standards.  Darwin's theory of evolution proposes that humans evolved over millions of years from animal speciesincluding, most famously, early primates that also are the ancestors of modern-day apes. Such thinking, which challenged religious accounts of a deity creating humans, was considered radical, even blasphemous, when Darwin published it in 1859.  Central to Darwin's thesis was his scientific explanation of life's diversity: that natural selection is enough to explain the evolution of all species.  The scientific community has overwhelmingly scorned creationism and its latest incarnation, intelligent design, as a pretext for biblical explanations of how the world came to be, and asserts that there is no weakness or doubt in the scientific community about evolution.  Last year, the National Academy of Sciences called for the public to be better informed about the importance of understanding and teaching evolution. The academy released a booklet titled "Science, Evolution, and Creationism"the third explanation of evolution put out since 1984 by one of the nation's leading scientific organizations.  However, those who take issue with evolution believe it should be treated with healthy skepticism and argue that having high school students question a scientific theory overwhelmingly accepted by scientists teaches them critical thinking.  "This debate will impact whether students are taught to think critically and scientifically when you learn about evolution. It's important for students to learn how to think like scientists and not be forced to treat these controversial topics like a dogma," Casey Luskin, a policy analyst with the Discovery Institute, a group that questions the theory of evolution, said in an article in the San Antonio Express-News.  Proponents of evolution say the dogma is on the other side, with the Discovery Institute and others purposely distorting and ignoring scientific evidence to reach their desired conclusion.  For decades, the teaching of evolution in public schools has been a flash point in some states, with proponents of ideas such as creationism and intelligent design trying to gain a place in science classes.  The issue has been before school officials, legislators and courts in Alabama, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Virginia.  The controversy over the teaching of intelligent design came to a head in Pennsylvania, where the Dover School Board voted that ninth-grade students must be read a statement encouraging them to read about intelligent design. A federal judge said the board violated the Constitution in doing so because intelligent design is religious creationism in disguise and injecting it into the curriculum violates the constitutional separation of church and state.  "Academic freedom" bills have emerged but failed in various state legislatures, the National Center for Science Education said.  An "academic freedom" act has been adopted as law in Louisiana, and there is legislation in Florida calling for an "academic freedom" bill that would mandate a "thorough presentation and critical analysis of the scientific theory of evolution."  The center says such bills are strategies by creationists to appeal to the American sense of balance, and give the false sense that there are different sides to scientific issues such as evolution.  "Two plus 2 is not 5," said the group's spokesman, Robert Luhn.

WASHINGTON More than 35,000 fugitives across the United States were arrested in June as part of an annual sweep that teams the U.S. Marshals Service with local law enforcement in a summer push to clean up the streets, U.S. Marshals said Thursday.  U.S. Marshals director John F. Clark says unregistered sex offenders were a major target.  Among the 35,190 fugitives apprehended during Operation FALCON (Federal and Local Cops Operating Nationally) were 2,356 fugitive sex offenders, the service said.  "This might be considered the cream of the crop for the most violent felons that are out there. For example, we arrested 433 murder suspects," said U.S. Marshals director John F. Clark at a Chicago, Illinois, news conference.  In the course of the operation, the marshals also confiscated 582 firearms and 2,400 kilograms of narcotics. "Often when we find fugitives in hiding, we have other fruits of their crimes: firearms, drugs, some other evidence of some type of criminal activity," Clark said.  Unregistered sex offenders were a major target, Clark said.  "We highlighted one [case] here in the Chicago area. It involved an individual who was alleged to have molested a 9-year-old girl. He had violated his parole, and after an investigation he was located," he said. "There's evidence of further crimes that happened since he didn't register as a sex offender. This is typical of the type of individual who is out there, somewhere on the streets of America, and is often harming children or others."  One operation involved a Cleveland, Ohio, Police SWAT team and the U.S. Marshals, who were following a lead on Jeremiah Jackson, 29, who was wanted for murder, accused of shooting a woman in the back during a robbery.  On June 9, the team surrounded a house where an intelligence surveillance team said Jackson might be. Jackson was reported to be armed and dangerous. But Deputy U.S. Marshal Brian Koerbel said once Jackson saw the team, it had its man.  "When he saw he really had nowhere to go, he gave himself up," said Koerbel. "He made the statement, 'I'm the guy you're looking for and I'll come right down.' "  In Cleveland, Koerbel said, the program was a success.  "We were able to arrest 1,211 people in a 30-day period. Five were for homicides," he said.  Typically, the U.S. Marshals office in Cleveland arrests about 100 fugitives in any given month. "This is just the type of operation that brings us all together and shows we're a force of one and shows the community we're here and this is a safe place to raise a family," Koerbel said.  Jackson was jailed on $10 million bond. He has not entered a plea  on the murder charge, but his father, Willie James Jackson, told CNN affiliate WJW the police have the wrong man.  
 The U.S. Soccer Federation will hold a news conference Monday to formally introduce former German skipper Jurgen Klinsmann, 46, as the new coach of the men's national soccer team.  Klinsmann's first match will be a highly anticipated August 10 bout with Mexico, which thrashed the U.S. 4-2 in this year's Gold Cup final.  He takes over as the team's 35th manager, replacing Bob Bradley who had coached the team since January 2007.  Bradley was relieved of his duties Thursday.  U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati said he was excited to see Klinsmann taking over.  "He is a highly accomplished player and coach with the experience and knowledge to advance the program," Gulati said in a statement last week. "Jrgen has had success in many different areas of the game and we look forward to the leadership he will provide on and off the field."  Klinsmann's record as a coach is a mixed bag. Though he silenced many of his critics by leading Germany to a third-place trophy in the 2006 World Cup, he stepped down to be with his wife, Debbie, and their two children, who live in California.  "I have a big wish to return to my family and get back to normality," he said during a news conference announcing his resignation.  In 2008, the Goppingen native took over Bayern Munich, one of Germany's most prestigious club teams, but he was replaced after a year, despite a 25-9-9 record and making the quarterfinals of Europe's Champions League. It was widely reported that he did not see eye-to-eye with Munich's board of directors.  It's worth noting that Klinsmann coached American star Landon Donovan during a loan to Munich. Klinsmann told Sports Illustrated's Grant Wahl last year that he believes Donovan "can play at the highest level" and thinks the 29-year-old midfielder could have excelled in Germany's Bundesliga had he been given more time.  Klinsmann's resume as a player is far more impressive. As a striker, "the Golden Bomber" always had a knack for finding the back of the net and amassed 232 goals in 516 games during his 17-year club career. During that time, he played for some of the world's best teams, including Italy's Inter Milan, England's Tottenham Hotspur and Bayern Munich.  He also played for the West German national team that won the 1990 World Cup and the German squad that brought home 1996's European Championship. He scored 47 goals in 108 games for his national team.  Klinsmann has been considered for the U.S. post in the past, but negotiations crumbled twice over the amount of control Klinsmann would wield in coaching the top American squad.  Last year, Klinsmann told Wahl that he passed on the job after the 2006 World Cup but "left it totally positive." In a separate interview with SI's soccer guru, Klinsmann said he turned down the job following the 2010 World Cup because the U.S. Soccer Federation wouldn't give him full control of the team in writing. He declined to explain exactly what the federation refused to include.  "That goes too much into specifics," Klinsmann told Wahl. "I don't want to go that far. We couldn't get the deal done because of a couple of issues, and the main issue was we couldn't get it into a written format. And that's it."  Klinsmann will immediately replace Bradley, who was signed to a second four-year contract in August. He had a 45-25-12 record but faced criticism for decisions that observers said led to losses in pivotal games. Included are a 2-1 loss to Ghana in the second round of the 2010 World Cup, and blown 2-0 leads in the 2009 Confederations Cup final against Brazil and the Gold Cup final against Mexico in June.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell began with an apology.  It was for his handling of the scandal surrounding Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who has been indefinitely suspended following the release of a video that shows him knocking out his future wife with a punch.  "I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better," Goodell said during a news conference in Manhattan on Friday.  But what does that mean? And how will the NFL carry that out?  Here are five takeaways from Goodell's news conference:  1. Never considered resigning  Goodell and the NFL have been criticized  and scrutinized over the handling of the Rice case by everybody from women's rights groups to sponsors to the Obama administration.  In days leading up to the news conference, calls mounted for the commissioner to step down.  Goodell said it was something he never considered.  "I am focused on doing my job. I understand when people are critical of my performance, but we have work to do. I am proud of the opportunity we have to make a difference and do the right thing," he said.  "We've acknowledged that we need to make changes and now we have to get those changes going."  2. Education for players, staff  Goodell announced changes to the NFL's personal conduct policy, saying all players and staff would be required to undergo training and education about how to prevent domestic violence and sexual assault.  The classes are expected to begin within the next month, he said.  However, Goodell provided little detail about the education and training classes other than to say the league would include experts.  3. Conduct committee  One of the chief steps being taken to address the league's handling of domestic violence and sexual abuses cases is the creation of a committee to review the NFL's personal conduct policy.  Goodell said he hoped to have the committee in place by the time the Super Bowl is played on February 2, but he did not provide a timeline for the committee to make changes to the policy.  The committee will include input from the NFL Players Association and experts in the prevention of domestic abuse and sexual assault. Goodell did not say whether it would include law enforcement officials or mental health care professionals.  4. What Rice said  Much of the criticism surrounding the Rice case has to do with how Goodell and the league handled the case after learning in February that the running back had knocked out his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator and dragged her out.  Goodell suspended Rice without pay and fined him an additional game check for "conduct detrimental to the NFL."  Since the video showing Rice punch Palmer was made public this month, Rice has since been indefinitely suspended. Goodell said he had not seen the video prior to its release by TMZ.  During the news conference, Goodell told reporters the account provided by Rice was different than what was depicted in the video.  "I'm telling you right now it's inconsistent with what he told us," he said.  But Goodell declined to comment further on what the player told him, citing an ongoing appeal of Rice's suspension.  5. Reevaluating how NFL gathers information  When asked why the league did not get a copy of the videotape during its initial investigation into the Rice case earlier this year, Goodell said the league's security department asked for it several times.  "We got it with one phone call," the TMZ reporter told him, adding that the NFL has an entire department to investigate conduct issues.  Goodell did not answer, saying only he would re-evaluate how the NFL gathers information.  
 It's Valentine's Day, and the Olympic village is in the moodat least that's the story according to one champion athlete at this month's Games.  Slopestyle gold medalist Jamie Anderson revealed she had to delete her account with online dating app Tinder before her snowboard event in order to focus on the Olympics.  "Tinder in the Olympic Village is next level," the 23-year-old from South Lake Tahoe, California said in an interview with the magazine U.S. Weekly published Wednesday.  "It's all athletes! In the mountain village it's all athletes. It's hilarious. There are some cuties on there.  "There was a point where I had to be like OK, this is way too distracting. I deleted my account to focus on the Olympics."  Tinder is a matchmaking app for smartphones that facilitates communication between nearby users, prompting them to decide whether they like each other on the basis of a photograph and a brief profile.  If two users select "like" for one another, the match is made known to both individuals and they can begin messaging.  With most athletes owning smartphones and being active on social media, it was perhaps inevitable that the increasingly popular Tinder would play Cupid at the Olympics.  In fact, the company has experienced a 400% day-over-day increase of new users in Sochi since the Games began last Friday, Tinder CEO and founder Sean Rad told the Wall Street Journal.  With almost 3,000 competitors staying in the Olympic Village alone, and that doesn't include support staff, officials, media and fans who are all staying nearby.  This diverse mix of people from all corners of the globe, for what is essentially one big party over a three-week period, is perhaps why organizers have seen fit to supply roughly 100,000 condoms to the Olympic village.  "I haven't seen it in action but I've definitely heard the athletes' village is a melting pot of good-looking people at the top of their sport," U.S. snowboarder Alex Diebold told reporters.  "They do provide free condoms, which I think is a really smart move on their part. I think you can get them at the medical office. We're good-looking people all hanging out together and stuff like that is bound to happen," he added.  Fellow American Jacqueline Hernandez said while she had been staying offline in the run-up to her snowboard cross event on Sunday, that was unlikely to remain the case for long.  "I haven't gotten on Tinder since I got here. I think after our event when we move up to the mountain (athletes' village) I will definitely try to Tinder it up," the 21-year-old said.  But while some athletes have taken to modern technology in the search for that someone special in Sochi, others have kept it old-school.  The traditional definition of Valentine's Day, after all, is for couples and singles to express their loveopenly or anonymouslythrough cards, candy, flowers and gifts.  "If you have a girlfriend, you should tell her you love her every day," said Austrian snowboarder Hanno Douschan.  "Maybe when I get back to the athletes' village I will find a chocolate heart from the cleaning lady."  U.S. figure skater Ashley Wagner went one step further and tweeted a Valentine's card to herself, making light of her underwhelmed reaction to the judges' scorecards after she performed in the team event last weekendan image that went viral.  Others are so focused on the competition, however, that Valentine's Day and the Tinder factor have barely registered.  Australia's Tora Bright, who followed her 2010 halfpipe gold with silver in Sochi, had to be reminded it was February 14.  "Oh, it's Valentine's day today?" the snowboarder asked. "Every day is Valentine's day. I give my love to all my loved ones every day.  "Well I don't have a Valentine, so I'm just going to forget about it."  Swiss snowboarder Simona Meiler, meanwhile, was none too enamored with the focus on anything other than the sport.  "My plans for Valentine's Day is to go to the press conference, rest and get ready for tomorrow," the 24-year-old said.  "It's a day of preparation like any other. I've got other things on my mind, it's not my focus."

In the end, it played out like a movie. A tense, heartbreaking story, and then a surprise twist at the end.  As eight of Mary Jane Veloso's fellow death row inmatesmostly foreigners, like herwere put to death by firing squad early Wednesday in a wooded grove on the Indonesian island of Nusa Kambangan, the Filipina maid and mother of two was spared, at least for now.  Her family was returning from what they thought was their final visit to the prison on so-called "execution island" when a Philippine TV crew flagged their bus down to tell them of the decision to postpone her execution.  Her ecstatic mother, Celia Veloso, told CNN: "We are so happy, so happy. I thought I had lost my daughter already but God is so good. Thank you to everyone who helped us."  Supporters were "overjoyed" with the news. "This is all because of the efforts of the Filipino people and the international community who have been with Mary Jane, her family and the Filipino people all throughout," a supporter said upon hearing of the eleventh-hour reprieve.  Veloso was arrested in 2010 after a flight from Malaysia to Indonesia when $500,000 worth of heroin was discovered in the lining of her luggage. Supporters, including the Filipino advocacy group Migrante, and her lawyers claim the young mother was the victim of human trafficking.  They say she was offered work in Malaysia, but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and wasn't aware the bag she'd been given for the return journey to Indonesia was filled with drugs.  The Philippine Embassy in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, said Wednesday that it welcomed the reprieve and appreciated that the Indonesian government appeared to be reconsidering the case.  "While Mary Jane was convicted for a drug-related offense in 2010, the Philippines believes that due to her personal circumstances, she herself is a victim of heartless drug syndicates," embassy political secretary Jed Llona said. "The alleged recruiters of Mary Jane are currently being investigated in the Philippines, and the embassy hopes that through this ongoing case, those truly responsible for drug trafficking in the region are brought to justice."  Questions about her detention and trial, including the competency of her translator, have also been raised.  Veloso had been given the customary 72 hours' notice of execution, and her family had traveled to Nusa Kambangan to say their final goodbyes.  However, developments in her home country appear to have changed or at least delayedher fate.  CNN Philippines reported that Veloso's alleged recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio, and her partner Julius Lacanilao surrendered to authorities in the Philippines Tuesday. Sergio faces charges of illegal recruitment, human trafficking, and fraud, but maintains her innocence.  Sergio said that she had received anonymous death threats by phone, and further threatening messages from Veloso's family on social media.  Veloso's lawyer, Edre Olalia, confirmed that developments in the case had prompted the stay.  "As far as Mary Jane is concerned, her life has been spared for the moment and the reason is that the legal proceedings in the Philippines must be respected first in view of the fact that the illegal recruiter is now in custody," he told CNN Philippines.  Indonesian President Joko Widodo told reporters Wednesday that the decision was the result of the Indonesian government's desire to cooperate with the ongoing case in the Philippines.  "There was a letter from the Philippine government saying that there is a legal process related to human trafficking there. So we need to respect this legal process."  He stressed, however, that the execution was delayed, rather than canceled.  Veloso's case has touched the public in her native Philippines, with the highest levels of government and celebrity calling for mercy.  President Benigno Aquino met his Indonesian counterpart on the sidelines at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur last weekend and pressed for him to commute Veloso's sentence.  Filipino boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao, who is primed to fight longtime foe Floyd Mayweather Saturday, made a televised appeal to President Widodo, also asking for mercy for Veloso.  "I am begging and knocking on your kind heart that Your Excellency will grant executive clemency to her," he said.  Veloso's sons, Mark Daniel and Mark Darren, ages 6 and 12, issued a heartbreaking plea, aimed at Widodo's son, asking him to intervene.  "Please tell your father not to execute her," they asked.  Ordinary people are also fighting for their compatriot, including Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong, who protested at the Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong Tuesday.  Philippine Embassy officials said Veloso would be returned to Yogyakarta prison in Central Java later on Wednesday.  Lawyers fighting to delay her execution previously said they'd given up their bid after her second legal review was rejected on Monday.  
 Ukrainian acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said Wednesday that the separatist protests in Ukraine's eastern region would be resolved within 48 hourseither through negotiations or the use of force.  At the same time, Russia insisted that the presence of its troops just over the border was no reason to worry.  The United States and others have accused Russia of fomenting the separatist unrest as a pretext for military intervention.  Using classified and commercial satellite imagery, the United States estimates there are up to 40,000 Russian troops on the border with eastern Ukraine. NATO has also warned of a major troop buildup.  The U.S. ambassador in Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt, posted photos via Twitter on Wednesday to illustrate the U.S. estimates.  The photos depict what is supposedly a field outside the Russian city of Rostov empty in October, filled with troops and armored vehicles on April 2.  A U.S. official with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN those photos "are consistent" with classified imagery.  Washington is sharing some information with the Ukrainians, but not highly classified intelligence, the official said. Ukraine was aligned with Moscow until a month ago, and it is believed Ukraine's security services are still penetrated by the Russians, the official said.  But Russia's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Ukraine and the United States have "no reason for concern" about the presence of Russian forces, which it says are on military exercises.  "Russia has repeatedly stated that it does not conduct unusual or unplanned activities which are militarily significant on its territory near the border with Ukraine," the Foreign Ministry said in a prepared statement.  It added that accusations that Russia was building up its armed forces were "groundless."  Asked if he considered the threat of a Russian advance into Ukraine more likely now than last week, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told CNN's Jim Sciutto, "We are always vigilant.  We are always looking at the options that we need to take."  Hagel said Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, has been asked to develop "new and additional measures and options."  Meanwhile, the separatist protests in eastern Ukraine have entered their fourth day.  Pro-Russian protesters seized government buildings in the cities of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv on Sunday.  Rebels who occupied Donetsk's regional government building a day laterdeclaring a "people's republic" and calling for a referendum on secession from Ukraine to be held by May 11remained in control of the building Wednesday, holed up behind substantial makeshift barricades.  In Kharkiv, more than 70 people were detained Tuesday in what Ukrainian authorities said was an anti-terrorism operation, as security forces cleared a government building of protesters.  The 48-hour deadline set by Avakov to end the crisis may escalate the tensions in Ukraine's eastern region.  "There are two opposite ways for resolving this conflicta political dialogue and the heavy-handed approach. We are ready for both," he said, according to official news agency Ukrinform.  On Tuesday, Moscow warned that any use of force to crack down on protests in the region, which borders Russia, could lead to civil war and called for "the immediate cessation of any military preparations."  Opinion: Turning Crimea into 'Putinland'?  Hostage reports  There were conflicting reports late Tuesday over whether demonstrators who seized control of a Security Service of Ukraine building in Luhansk took hostages.  An anti-terrorism unit outside the building said the pro-Russian demonstrators were holding hostages, Victoria Syumar, a Security Service spokeswoman, and Yarema Duh, spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council, told CNN.  Fifty-one people were released from the building early Wednesday morning, the Security Service said in a statement.  But pro-Russian demonstrators holed up in the building denied having taken anyone hostage, according to Reuters reports.  Ukrainian interim President Oleksandr Turchynov reiterated Tuesday that he would treat pro-Russian separatists who have seized buildings in the country's east as "terrorists" who will be prosecuted with the full force of the law.  His remarks came ahead of a vote in parliament that approved legislation outlawing groups and individuals who call for separatism. Of the 450 members of the Ukrainian parliament, 230 voted in favor of the bill.  Kerry: 'Contrived pretext' for intervention  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the situation in eastern Ukraine twice on the phone Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.  The two officials talked about "the importance of resolving the security situation in key cities in eastern Ukraine peacefully and through dialogue, and they both rejected the use of force to obtain political objectives," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.  Kerry said Tuesday that Russian forces and special agents were behind what he called the most-recent "chaos" in eastern Ukraine.  He described the developments as "more than deeply disturbing" and said they amounted to what could be a "contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in Crimea."  Echoing that view, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told CNN's "Amanpour" show that Russia is financing subversion in eastern Ukraine using the pretext of ethnic tensions.  "What's happening in Ukraine is unacceptable," he said. "A more powerful nation is first taking a province away from a less powerful country and now financing subversion using the pretext of ethnic problems, which are nonexistent."  Kerry will meet Monday with his Russian, Ukrainian and European Union counterparts to discuss efforts to de-escalate the crisis, according to a statement from EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.  Ashton "calls against any further destabilization of Ukraine, whether from the inside or the outside," the statement said.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her country's parliament Wednesday that "the situation in the Ukraine remains difficult ... and unfortunately in many places it is not clear how Russia helps the de-escalation of the situation.  "Therefore we will continue to do what we've been doing: on the one hand pursue a path of dialogue, but on the other hand make clear that in our view Ukraine has a right to its own development. We demand this. Ukraine must decide its own destiny, and in this we will help Ukraine."  Kerry warned of increased sanctions targeting Russia's banking, energy, mining and arms sectors if the Russians "cross over" into eastern Ukraine. Current sanctions target individuals over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's southeastern Crimean Peninsula last month.  U.S. Navy ship headed for Black Sea  Similar pattern seen in revolts  U.S. officials told CNN on Tuesday that one reason the United States believes Russia may have orchestrated the pro-Russian demonstrations in Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv is that the disturbances and violence had a similar pattern and similar separatist motivations, even though the cities are at significant distances from one another.  U.S. officials have long noted that these three cities are specific areas that Moscow has been trying to influence.  Although Ukrainian forces have been able to regain control for now, the U.S. assessment is that Russia may be trying to fabricate a pretext for military action using some of the tens of thousands of troops still massed on the border, several U.S. officials told CNN.  Even after weeks of tension and uncertainty, the United States does not know what political calculation Russian President Vladimir Putin might make in deciding whether or not to move his troops into Ukraine, officials said.  The belief is the decision will be made by Putin with little or no influence from his top military and foreign policy advisers. There is also a U.S. view that Putin may leave the troops on the border for some time to come to intimidate Ukraine's government, American officials said.  Those troops remain positioned so close, and are so heavily armed, that the United States and NATO calculate they could "roll across" eastern Ukraine in three to five days, one official said.  Russia has said it does not intend to invade eastern Ukraine, although it says it reserves the right to intervene to protect ethnic Russians.

They are two of the continent's acknowledged football powerhouses and later Sunday either Ivory Coast or Ghana will end a long and frustrating wait to be crowned Africa Cup of Nations champions.  Ghana last lifted the trophy 33 years ago and was beaten in the 1992 final by Ivory Coast, the last time The Elephants claimed the prestigious crown.  The meeting in Bata will bring down the curtain on a tournamenthosted at the last minute by Equatorial Guinea after Morocco declined because of Ebola fearswhich has seen some fine football but also been blighted by crowd trouble inside and outside the stadiums.  Ghana's 3-0 semifinal win over the hosts saw the worst scenes, with a helicopter deployed to disperse fans at the Estadio de Malabo and the game held up for several minutes.  Overshadowed by the violent scenes was a solid team performance by the Black Stars, with Andre Ayew, the son of the legendary Abedi 'Pele' Ayew, rounding off the scoring with his third goal of the competition.  Ivory Coast, with a host of talented players such as Manchester City's Yaya Toure and the club's new signing Wilfried Bony, has come on strong after needing to beat Cameroon to reach the knockout stages.  The Ivorians will start marginal favorites to win the Africa Cup of Nations for the second time.  Ghana is a four-time winner and has five wins in nine matches with Ivory Coast at the finals, losing three with the other drawn.  
 Packaged meat company Smithfield Packing Company is recalling some 38,000 pounds of pork sausage because it may contain small pieces of plastic, likely from gloves, the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service announced Thursday.

 "127 Hours" isn't just the name of James Franco's Oscar-nominated film, it also could describe the length of time he waits before delving into a new career.  Musical producer; college lecturer, bar owner; Walmart greeterwhich of these titles won't Franco be adding to his rsum in the coming months? If you guessed Walmart greeter, you're rightfor now.  "I'm doing it because I love it," the star has said of juggling so many jobs. "Why not do as many things I love as I can? As long as the work is good."  Considering all the occupations he holds, it's tempting to blame Franco for the country's unemployment problem. He's absolutely everywhere these days, and just about the only place you won't see the 32-year-old Oscar nominee/host's squinty, smirking face is on a milk carton.  Yet, as true Franco-philes know, it wasn't always this way.  After gaining attention in the 1999-2000 TV series "Freaks & Geeks," Franco embarked on a career as a "serious actor." He shunned the limelight, nabbed a Golden Globe for the "James Dean" TV movie, appeared with Robert DeNiro in "City by the Sea" and headlined a string of little-seen dramas, including "Tristan & Isolde" and "Annapolis."  "It was death," he has said of his career path at the time. "I didn't want to act anymore. It was death doing the things I was supposed to be doing. I couldn't make those movies anymore. ... I had the conversation with my manager like, 'If this is what it's gonna be, I can't do this anymore.' So, it wasn't like the answer was, 'Hey! Go do a bunch of crazy stuff!' I had to figure out how to change what I was doing. I had to figure out that I had to believe in my own taste. Not believe in what you should do. Believe in what I liked and it's OK."  Apparently, those likes included books, bongs and bedpans: Franco went back to college, made the 2008 stoner comedy, "Pineapple Express," and took a role on "General Hospital" as serial killer Franco.  The soap-opera gig was an unheard move for a successful film actorseriously, can you picture Christian Bale doing "All My Children"?but by 2010, you'd be hard-pressed to define Franco as a film actor anyway: He was modeling in a wet T-shirt for a Gucci fragrance ad, had made a documentary about "Saturday Night Live," published the short-story collection "Palo Alto" and unveiled the sex-and-violence-themed performance-art piece "The Dangerous Book Four Boys" at a New York gallery.  Then, shortly after unleashing those whoppers, Franco pulled out the really big guns and fired off a new string of head scratchers.  He premiered a "Three's Company" art installation at Sundancewhile wearing a Suzanne Somers wig, no lessand is now turning the old sitcom into an off-Broadway play and a movie.  He's hosting the Oscars and also hosting the after-party! At his new bar! Where he'll sing!  He's returning to "General Hospital," writing and directing three screenplays, and he'll appear on Broadway in "Sweet Bird of Youth."  And wait ...  he's producing a musical at Yale and will be both the subject and instructor of a Columbia College Hollywood course on film editing.  You heard correctly: He. Is. A. College. Course.  While Franco has been criticizedand even skewered on "Saturday Night Live"for his mindboggling multitasking, that may be exactly what he wants. After all, an artist's job is to inspire debate and discussion, and Francomuch like Lady Gaga, minus the telephone hats, platform boots and meat dresses (for now)certainly keeps the public talking as well as guessing with his every move.  "Some people say, 'Yeah, that guy will do anything. What's he going to do next?' But it doesn't mean that I don't believe in the projects that I'm doing," he has said. "You can do the crazy projects. Just be smart about it."  Well said, Franco. Now could you tell me which aisle home goods are on?

Five full weeks into Aaron Hernandez's murder trial, prosecutors have called 77 witnesses. Jurors have yet to hear from the former NFL star's fiance, Shayanna Jenkins, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick or owner Robert Kraft.  But this week did bring emotional testimony and important developments in the case against Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd in 2013.  Check out some of the key moments you might have missed this week.  A DNA analyst from the Massachusetts State Police crime lab said she found that Hernandez's DNA matched the DNA taken from a marijuana joint found near Lloyd's body at the crime scene. Lloyd's DNA also was found on the blunt.  The DNA analyst, Diane Biagiotti, testified to finding a partial DNA match from Hernandez on the shell casing found in the dumpster of the Enterprise rental car office. But under cross-examination, lead defense attorney Jamie Sultan got Biagiotti to acknowledge there's a high likelihood that DNA from chewing gum could have transferred to the shell casing found in the dumpster.  The office manager at the rental car office, Keelia Smyth, testified that she put the shell casing and the gum together after finding the items in the Nissan Altima returned by Hernandez on June 17, 2013. She said she threw them in the trash bin outside of her office.  Inside Hernandez's downward spiral  It was revealed by Sultan that the state never submitted the gum for DNA testing. The state has not yet explained why. We may hear the answer during the state's redirect of Biagiotti on Monday. Hernandez is seen on surveillance video buying gum, and he also offered some to Smyth.  Biagiotti said under cross-examination that it's highly unlikely to find DNA on any shell casing. One reason is because the heat from the gun wipes away any DNA, she said. The shell casings found at the crime scene did not have enough DNA on them to produce a DNA profile.  Hernandez's family was in court on Friday after a week's absence. Hernandez's mother, Terri Hernandez, told CNN' that she thought Friday "went very well" for him.  Testimony this week also focused on fingerprints from Hernandez and Lloyd that were found inside the rented Nissan Altima.  The car also had fingerprints of Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who are also charged with killing Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.  State Trooper David Mackin, a fingerprint expert with the Massachusetts State Police crime scene services, reported finding the fingerprints of Wallace and Ortiz in a Chrysler 300 that Hernandez rented. Prosecutors call it the "getaway car," which was ultimately found abandoned in Bristol, Connecticut.  But no prints were found on the .22-caliber gun recovered on the edge of a wooded area near Hernandez's home.  Hernandez is charged with illegal possession of that gun.  In addition, no prints were found on any of the shell casings, including the casing found stuck to the blue bubblegum in the dumpster outside the Enterprise office.  Another key find: tire treads of the rear passenger tire of the Altima matched a tire impression found at the crime scene, according to court testimony.  Shaquilla Thibou, Lloyd's younger sister and the last family member to see him before he was killed, took the stand Monday.  About an hour before his death, she said she watched him get into a silver Nissan Altima as she sat in a friend's car outside her home.  Thibou, who was 19 at the time of her brother's killing, told jurors that when Lloyd first walked to the car, he opened the front passenger door. He stopped and then opened the back passenger door and entered the car.  "The light came on and there was a shadow in the back seat," she said.  Then she saw the Altima pull away. It was 2:32 a.m.  Thirty minutes later, Thibou returned to her home and charged her dead phone. She noticed a text from her big brother.  Thibou was not allowed to share with jurors what was said in those texts. The judge ruled there is not enough proof the text message meant Lloyd feared for his life, legally called "a dying declaration."  That means that the jury did not hear that at 3:07 a.m., Lloyd texted his sister asking, "U saw who I'm with?"  At 3:11 a.m he checked in again, texting "hello."  Finally, at 3:19 a.m. Thibou answered, "my phone was dead who was that?"  At 3:22 a.m., Lloyd responded, "Nfl." A minute later, he sent his last text, "just so u know."  During grand jury testimony, Thibou admitted she thought her brother was bragging.  When reliving the moment when police came to her home to tell her family that Lloyd had been shot to death, Thibou began to cry silently, wiping her tears after Assistant District Attorney William McCauley gave her a tissue.  During cross-examination, defense attorney Michael Fee introduced a photo of Lloyd taken by Thibou. It showed Lloyd smiling and sitting in the driver's seat of the black Suburban that Hernandez loaned him.  On Wednesday, jurors got an up-close view of the clothes Lloyd was wearing the night he was shot six times. Massachusetts crime lab forensic chemist Sherri Menendez held up Lloyd's bullet-riddled dark blue Old Navy sweatshirt and then his red plaid shirt.  Jurors craned their necks to get a better view of the bullet holes in the sweatshirt. The shirt was stained with blood.  Menendez tested the bullet holes for gunshot residue consisting of what she described as burned particles and vaporous lead. During her testing of bullet holes on the front of the sweatshirt, she found both and was able to determine that Lloyd was shot from as close as 3 feet.  The autopsy showed the final two shots were fired into his chest while he was laying face up in the ground.  Just weeks before Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder, he toured rental apartments with New England Patriot employee Kevin Anderson, real estate agent Barbara Scardino testified Thursday.  She said she was initially contacted by Anderson to find some apartments to show Hernandez.  He had previously called her to help other Patriot players find homes and apartment rentals, sometimes second residences near Gillette Stadium. This means the Patriot staff knew about Hernandez's second home.  In early May of 2013, she showed Anderson and Hernandez four apartments.  Hernandez settled on the two-bedroom condo in Franklin, Massachusetts, referred to as his "flophouse."  Hernandez's home in North Attleboro and his condo in Franklin are each about 15 minutes away from the stadium.  Hernandez's Franklin neighbor, Carol Bailey, also took the stand, telling jurors that she met another man that also stayed in the condo. It was Hernandez's friend Wallace.  Bailey paid close attention to Hernandez and Wallace, seeing them come and go during their short stay there. During her one attempt to talk to Hernandez and say hello, she says he sort of grunted back, calling it a "nondescript" noise.  She also testified that she often heard loud voices that sounded "locker room-ish" coming from the apartment as well as a strong "skunk-like" smell seeping into her apartment from their shared wall.  After mid-June, she never saw him again.  A representative from Sprint, Justin Darrow, started off the week with a light moment. He appeared nervous and stopped to take a moment while answering a question. He then turned to Judge Susan Garsh and apologized.  "It's a big case. Sorry."  Showing no emotion, Garsh struck the comment from the record.  Darrow went on to testify to multiple calls between Sprint cell phone client Ernest Wallace and Odin Lloyd, Aaron Hernandez and Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, the night before and morning of Lloyd's death. Prosecutors say they believe Hernandez was using his fiancee's phone to call Wallace.  Jenkins granted immunity  Darrow also explained how cell sites (or towers) in the Sprint network tracked the phone calls, and thus tracked the direction they were driving.  Another cell phone representative also testified. T-Mobile engineer Patrick Quinn testified about the data transmissions from Lloyd's cell phone beginning on June 17, 2013, at 2:32 a.m. That's when Lloyd was picked up outside his home in the Nissan Altima. Data transmissions are the automatic updates that are sent to cell phones.  Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg methodically walked Quinn through data transmissions received on Lloyd's cell phone via multiple cell towers along the route he traveled from Dorchester to the industrial park in North Attleboro. The last cell tower was just 400 yards from Lloyd's body.  
 Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his government Tuesday, amid a political crisis fired by violent protests on the country's streets.  Azarov and his Cabinet will continue in their roles until a new government is formed, a notice on the presidential website said.  Yanukovych's announcement comes only hours after Azarov submitted his resignation and as the national parliament met in an emergency session aimed at ending the crisis.  In a first step, lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to repeal sweeping anti-protest laws whose passage this month angered anti-government demonstrators.  The special parliamentary session also looked at legislation that might provide amnesty for more than 200 people arrested since the demonstrations began in late November. It's been adjourned until Wednesday, when lawmakers will continue the debate, state news agency Ukrinform said.  But activists on the street have said that while the concessions are a step in the right direction, their fundamental grievances have yet to be addressed.  'We all want to live in a lawful state,' says Ukrainian protester  They want to see wide-ranging constitutional reform and a shake-up of the Ukrainian political system.  The controversial anti-protest laws were rammed through parliament on January 16 by a show of hands by members of Yanukovych's Party of Regions.  Anger about the legislation escalated the long-running anti-government protests into violent confrontations, with police and protesters fighting pitched battles in the icy streets of Ukraine's capital, Kiev.  Division of powers  As the crisis has deepened, Yanukovych's government has come under increasing pressure both internally and from Western governments concerned about an apparent bid to limit people's democratic rights.  Vitali Klitschko, leader of the opposition Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party, or UDAR, told reporters at parliament that the repeal of the anti-protest laws was a small but very important step.  Much remains to be done, he said, according to his party's website. "Today, we still have to consider a very important issue on the amnesty and release of all detained demonstrators," he said.  "It is also crucial to address the question of the constitutional reform, which will divide powers between a President, a Prime Minister and the Parliament."  In a statement posted on the government's website, Azarov said that by quitting he intended to "create more opportunities for social and political compromise for a peaceful settlement of the conflict."  That conflict "is a threat to the entire Ukrainian society and every citizen," he said, adding that the government was doing all it could to prevent bloodshed.  It will likely take more than Azarov's departure to satisfy the demands of hardy protesters who, despite the bitter cold and threat of violence, have massed in and around central Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, to demand Yanukovych's ouster and new elections.  In recent days, protests have also spread to other cities around the country.  Yatsenyuk: 'Shameful practice'  Azarov's resignation may have been a case of jumping before he was pushed.  He was widely expected to face a vote of no confidence in his government at the special parliamentary session, and his post had already been offered to an opposition leader.  Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who heads the Fatherland Party, refused Yanukovych's offer to be prime minister, but Azarov's position was made almost untenable.  Speaking in parliament Tuesday, Yatsenyuk urged the President to sign the law repealing the anti-protest legislation as soon as possible, according to the official Ukrinform news agency.  "I'm asking Viktor Yanukovych to immediately sign a law for which the parliament has just voted," he said. "We have finally closed the shameful practice of voting by a show of hands and abolished those laws against which the whole of Ukraine rebelled."  Fatherland is also the party of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who has been imprisoned since 2010 on charges the United States and Europe have called politically motivated. In a statement Monday evening, she called on the opposition to remain firm.  Another round of talks was held Monday between the government and the opposition as they sought a resolution to the crisis.  Read more: Is Ukraine becoming a dictatorship?  Force 'not the answer'  Ukraine was high on the agenda for a long-planned "Russia summit" in Brussels, Belgium, attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman van Rompuy.  Speaking at a news conference after the summit, Van Rompuy urged restraint and said those responsible for violence in Ukraine must be held accountable.  "The present stalemate must be rapidly overcome," he said, as he called for genuine dialogue between the government and opposition.  The European Union is ready to move ahead with the planned trade deal, or association agreement, with Ukraine whose dismissal by Yanukovych first triggered the popular protests, Van Rompuy added.  Barroso said the repeal of the anti-protest laws and a potential amnesty for arrested protesters, if confirmed, would be "important steps" toward resolving the crisis.  "Use of force is not the answer" to the present political situation, he said.  There have been tensions between Russia and the European Union over developments in Ukraine, with each side accusing the other of interference.  But Putin has denied that Moscow is exerting undue influence in Ukraine. "Russia has always respected, is respecting and will respect the sovereign rights of all the international entities including new states that emerged after breakdown of the Soviet Union," he said at the summit.  The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who was also at the summit, will travel to Kiev later Tuesday for talks. Stefan Fule, the European Commissioner for EU enlargement, also returned to Kiev on Tuesday.  Their main objective is to help bring a halt to violence and provide political stability in Ukraine, while respecting the will of the people, said Van Rompuy.

Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, is home to 45 million people. The clashes over the past 10 days are an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn the planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia instead.  He and Putin agreed a $15 billion deal for Russia to buy Ukrainian debt.

Kampong Speu, Cambodia Two people died after a raised concrete walkway collapsed Thursday at a shoe factory warehouse in Cambodia, police said.  Six other people were injured by the fallen walkway in a warehouse adjoining the factory, which is south of the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, said National Police Spokesman Kirt Chantharith.  More people could still be buried in the rubble, he said, but he added that it doesn't appear that dozens of people are trapped. Police are investigating the cause of the collapse.  The deaths at the Cambodian facility come as safety conditions in the garment industry in Asia are under scrutiny following the devastating collapse of a nine-story building housing textile factories in Bangladesh last month. That disaster killed 1,127 people.  At the scene of Thursday's accident at the Wing Star Shoe Co. factory, rescue workers hauled away chunks of concrete from the wreckage.  Shoes made by the Japanese sports apparel company Asics were in evidence at the factory.  Asics confirmed that its products were made there but said it was still trying to gather all the facts about the collapse. The company said it was sorry to hear about the loss of life in the accident.  One of the people killed was a 22-year-old man named Reom Saroun, said his uncle, Reom Rorn.  Eight members of the family all worked at the factory, Reom Rorn said. They live in the village where it is situated.  He said had never occurred to him that such an accident could happen at the facility.  "But now I am concerned that it will happen again," he said.  Nonetheless, he and other family members plan to return to work.  "It's a job," he said, noting that the part of the factory where he works doesn't have the upper level that collapsed in the warehouse and killed his nephew.  Bangladesh building collapse: An end to recovery efforts, a promise of new start  CNN's Junko Ogura in Tokyo contributed to this report.  
 We are only two games into a new English Premier League season, but with seven minutes to go in their match against Everton, some Arsenal fans may have been quietly writing off their team's title chances.  They also may well have pondered what had changed from last season.  In the corresponding fixture in April, Arsenal were thumped 3-0 by Roberto Martinez's side and as the clock ticked towards full time at Goodison Park on Saturday the same result looked on the cards.  After being harried and hurried by Everton, the Gunners were trailing by two goals and staring down the barrel before the game was turned on its head with late strikes from Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud.  Everton had assumed control of the match with two first-half goals. Gareth Barry's cross was headed in at the far post by Seamus Coleman in the 19th minute and on the stroke of halftime Steven Naismith doubled the lead as the Toffees caught the visitors on the counterattack.  Romelu Lukaku brushed off a challenge from Per Mertesacker to break down the right before laying on a pass for the advancing Naismith to slide home under goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.  Television replays showed that Naismith was marginally offside but while Arsene Wenger flapped his arms in protest the Goodison Park faithful celebrated.  Everton's industrious midfield continued to thwart Arsenal's advances in the second half before the Gunners fired their late salvo.  Ramsey toe-poked Santi Cazorla's low cross past Tim Howard in the 83rd minute to net his fourth goal in five matches before Olivier Giroud, who replaced new signing Alexis Sanchez at halftime, headed home to make it 2-2 in the final minute of normal time.  In the four added minutes, Arsenal looked as though they might snatch all three points but it ended honors even.  The draw maintains Arsenal's unbeaten start to the season and lifts them to third in the table with four points following a 2-1 win against Crystal Palace on the opening weekend.  Everton have two points from two games and are 10th.  Earlier in the day, Chelsea maintained their 100% start to the season with a 2-0 win against Premier League new boys, Leicester City.  Second-half strikes from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard earned Jose Mourinho's side all three points to keep the West Londoners at the top of the table on goal difference.  Swansea City and West Ham United were also winners on Saturday.  After beating Loius van Gaal's Manchester United 2-1 at Old Trafford last weekend Garry Monk's side bagged another three points with a 1-0 win at home to Burnley.  West Ham opened their account with a 3-1 win at Crystal Palace after losing to Tottenham Hotspur on the opening day of the season.  The games between Aston Villa and Newcastle United and Southampton and West Bromwich Albion ended in goalless draws.  Read more: Bayern start Bundesliga season with win

London A tiny handwritten and unpublished manuscript by "Jane Eyre" author Charlotte Bronte has sold for $1.07m after it sparked a fierce bidding war between rival museums.  The second issue of Bronte's "Young Men's Magazine"written in 1830 when she was just 14smashed pre-sale estimates of $310,000 to $465,000, and set a record for manuscripts by the Bronte sisters.  It contains three stories, written in Bronte's tiny, cramped hand, one of which is said to prefigure the story of Bertha, Mr. Rochester's insane wife in "Jane Eyre."  It was bought by the Musee des Lettres et Manuscrits in Paris, where it will go on display in January.  The Bronte Parsonage Museum, in the family's hometown of Haworth, Yorkshire, had earlier launched an appeal to raise money to allow them to buy it, but were outbid in the sale at Sotheby's in London.  Philip Errington, director of the auction house's books and manuscripts department, said the Bronte item was "of huge literary significance."  "The record price set today reflects the international interest in Charlotte Bront's work.  "This tiny manuscript represents her first burst of creativity and provides a rare and intimate insight into one of history's great literary minds."  The Bronte Parsonage Museum already owns four of the six manuscripts in the "Young Men's Magazine" series. The whereabouts of the sixth magazine are unknown.  Charlotte Bronte (1816-1855) and her sisters Emily (1818-1848) and Anne (1820-1849) wrote some of the best-loved novels in the English language, including "Jane Eyre," "Wuthering Heights" and "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall."  
 NEW YORK A New York nightclub hostess identified by a supermarket tabloid as Tiger Woods' mistress has called allegations that she is romantically involved with the golf superstar false and "ridiculous."  In an interview published Tuesday, Rachel Uchitel told The New York Post that a disgruntled acquaintance sold the story to the National Enquirer and that "not a word of it is true."  "I work in clubs, and I am a businesswoman," Uchitel said. "I do not have sex with celebrities, and I have not had an affair with Tiger Woods."  Speculation has swirled around Woods since a wreck outside his Florida home early Friday left him with minor injuries and a citation for careless driving. The Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday that its citation closes its investigation of the crash.  Woods was not required to talk to state police about the wreck and did not sit for an interview with investigators. He issued a statement Sunday saying he alone was responsible for the crash and denouncing "the many false, unfounded and malicious rumors that are currently circulating about my family and me." Opinion: Woods is only human  The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times, as well as three U.S. Open titles.  Investigators have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home at such an early hour. A police report says the wreck was not alcohol-related.  Uchitel said she has met Woods twice, once in her capacity as the VIP director at a club in Manhattan's trendy Meatpacking District and another time through a mutual friend.  "That's my job: to know these people, to have a relationship with them, to hang out with them," she told the Post. "It doesn't mean I am having sex with them or an affair with them."  She said the allegations "must feel horrible" to Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren.  "The worst part of it, it's not true," Uchitel said.

NASA and Japan improved our world view this week, or at least our view of the world.  This image using ASTER imagery shows the Himalayan glaciers in Bhutan.  The American space agency and Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry have released a new digital topographic map of Earth that accurately portrays more of our planet than ever before.  The new map consists of 1.3 million images taken by NASA's Terra satellite that have been pieced together to form a unified picture of the planet. The images were taken by a Japanese imaging instrument called the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, or ASTER.  "This is the most complete, consistent global digital elevation data yet made available to the world," said Woody Turner, a program scientist at NASA headquarters in Washington.  The map covers more than 99 percent of Earth's land mass from north of the Arctic Circle to south of the Antarctic Circle. During February 2000, space shuttle Endeavour mapped about 80 percent of the planet's surface.  "The ASTER data fill in many of the voids in the shuttle mission's data, such as in very steep terrains and in some deserts," said Michael Kobrick, a shuttle project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the program. "NASA is working to combine" the new data with that from the shuttle and other sources "to produce an even better global topographic map."  
 Heavy storms and tornadoes once again ripped through the Midwest on Friday night. Already devastated areas of Oklahoma were hit again, and this time the damage spread to neighboring states.  Over a dozen people are reported dead and many more are reported injured after at least 17 tornadoes touched down across the region. By Saturday, more than 210,000 customers were without power in the Midwest89,000 in Missouri, 86,000 in Oklahoma, 31,000 in Illinois, 3,000 in Arkansas, 1,000 in Kansas and 500 in Indiana. The threat is not over as heavy rain continues to fall and raise the threat for flooding, particularly in Missouri just north of St. Louis.  It hasn't even been two weeks since a devastating tornado destroyed much of the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, but because this storm is so soon after the first one, many of the organizations able to help people are already on the ground.  The Red Cross  The Red Cross of Oklahoma and The Red Cross of St. Louis are already assessing damage and providing emergency care, food and shelters for those affected by this new round of storms. You can help their efforts by donating to the Red Cross online or by texting REDCROSS to 90999. This will automatically charge $10 to your cell phone bill.  If you are outside of the United States and wish to contribute to the efforts of the Red Cross, please visit its international partner, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.  Samaritan's Purse  Samaritan's Purse deployed a group of staff members to travel from its North Carolina headquarters to Oklahoma with a Disaster Relief Unit right after the first storm hit. They came with a tractor trailer stocked with emergency supplies and equipment. Two groups of volunteers have remained in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and Moore, Oklahoma. They sought shelter through the storm last night and are ready to mobilize and help the newest survivors in need of assistance.  AmeriCares  Global health and disaster relief nonprofit AmeriCares has an emergency response team helping in Oklahoma. It will coordinate aid deliveries and assess the needs of survivors and medical organizations in the area.  Team Rubicon  Team Rubicon, a group of military veterans who respond to disasters, is another group that is already in Oklahoma helping survivors. Members also rode out the storm last night, but they have already emerged to assist in search and rescue efforts.  The Salvation Army  The Salvation Army has also jumped into action. Members have mobilized their canteens throughout the region, providing food, hydration and emotional support to first responders and storm survivors. You can contribute to the Salvation Army by calling 1-800-SAL-ARMY (1-800-725-2769), on their website or by texting "STORM" to 80888 to make an automatic $10 donation.

A Massachusetts woman convicted of attempted murder after failing to properly care for her cancer-stricken son was sentenced Friday to spend eight to 10 years in prison, prosecutors said.  Kristen LaBrie, 38, also was ordered to serve five years on probation and to complete an anger management program, said Essex County district attorney spokesman Steve O'Connell.  Prosecutors argued during LaBrie's trial that she intentionally withheld medications and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy, from her son, Jeremy Fraser.  Fraser, an autistic child who at age 6 was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was recuperating and his cancer was in remission. But in 2009 he died of leukemia. He was 9 years old.  Prosecutors argued that LaBrie's negligence was a factor that contributed to her son's death, allowing the cancer to spread after it had been beaten back into remission.  LaBrie had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the crime. She will be eligible for parole after eight years, O'Connell said.  She was sentenced to probation for convictions of child endangerment and assault and battery.  LaBrie's attorney said earlier that the system failed his client.  "Some of the times when people have mental problems they have a hard time reaching out. That's the purpose of social workers. Social workers are supposed to be able to detect when people have problems. The social workers on this case failed to do that. Certainly the warning signs were there," attorney Kevin James said on HLN's "Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell."  "Why didn't the people that knew better, why didn't they come forward and help?" he asked.  
 Democratic Senator Wendy Davis took to the floor of the Texas Senate at 11:18 a.m. in pink tennis shoes and began what she hoped would be a nearly 13 hour filibuster of an abortion bill.  As the day went on, the story of Senator Davis' filibuster caught fire on Twitter, and by the evening it was trending worldwide. There were at least 730,000 total tweets about the filibuster on Tuesday. The excitement peaked at 11:58 p.m. central time, just two minutes before the midnight deadline, with 5,776 tweets per minute about the story, according to Twitter.  Ultimately, after much confusion, it worked. Senate leaders tried to push a vote through, but didn't do so until a couple of minutes after midnight and, around 3 a.m., the state's legislature declared a special session over.  It even caught the attention of the official President Obama Twitter account, which tweeted out "Something special is happening in Austin tonight" with a link to The Texas Tribune during the filibuster's ninth hour.  Senate Bill 5 (SB 5) would ban abortions after the 20th week of a pregnancy. According to opponents, new abortion clinic standards in the bill would effectively shutter 37 of the state's 42 abortion clinics. The bill would give Texas some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country.  Strict senate rules for filibusters added to the drama. According to the rules, Senator Davis was not allowed to sit down, take a restroom break, go off topic or even lean.  By 10:30 p.m., the YouTube channel live streaming the special senate session passed 100,000 viewers, and the number jumped when Senator Davis was found to be in violation of senate rules for straying off topic. It was her third violation, which opened the window for a vote on whether or not she must cease the filibuster. Other senators who opposed the bill filled the remaining time with questions and points of order to run out the clock.  With fewer than five minutes left until the midnight deadline and an outcome still murky, the YouTube live stream had more than 180,000 viewers glued to their screens.  On Twitter, the topic was trending worldwide. At different points during the evening, #standwithwendy, #SB5, #texlege "Wendy Davis," "Texas," "Robert's Rules of Order" and "Midnight in Texas" were all trending on the social network. The #standwithwendy hashtag had 400,000 mentions on Tuesday, according to Twitter.  Senator Davis' Twitter account was silent while she was on the floor, but her number of followers jumped from just under 6,000 to more than 48,000 during the course of the day, an 8x increase.  Twitter also served as a rallying point for local protestors, who increased in numbers throughout the day to fill the senate chambers and line the rotunda. Many posted photos and Vines of the crowds. Chanting could be heard inside and outside the senate at midnight, when the floor erupted in confusion as it appeared senators were still taking a vote, even though the deadline had passed.  .

 Roland Garros will continue to host the French Open after the country's tennis officials rejected a move to a different part of the capital Paris.  Three groups had made bids to host the annual clay-court tournament, one of the four Grand Slams on offer during the season, from 2016 onwards.  The iconic Roland Garros site, which has hosted the French Open since its inception 86 years ago, will now be expanded and revamped.  French Tennis Federation president Jean Gachassin said in a statement: "We back the project to create a new Roland Garros venue, extending and modernizing the historic venue at Porte d'Auteuil.  CNN's Top 10 French Open moments  "It's a historic choice, probably the most important for our federation since its creation. Our aim was to offer an ambitious project.  "This decision has been made against the fashion for having things on giant scales but it's a project which is resolutely focused on the future. This hasn't been a default choice. The Paris project was the most beautiful of the four."  Spain's Rafael Nadal took the men's crown last year while Italian Francesca Schiavone won the women's title.  Meanwhile, Milos Raonic became the first Canadian to clinch an ATP World Tour title since 1995 after beating defending champion Fernando Verdasco 7-6 7-6 at the SAP Open in San Jose, California.  The 20-year-old was ranked 84th before the tournament but moved up to 59th when the new world rankings were released Monday.  Despite playing in his first final Raonic showed few signs of nerves as he survived four set points in the opener, recovering from 2-6 down in the tie-break to take it. He secured the title thanks to another tie-break in the second.  Raonic told the ATP Tour website: "I sort of used up my luck today, in a way. I got out of that first set and the second set I was a little bit more confident by then. It came out the way I wanted it to."  Raonic didn't drop a set in the tournament and finished with 58 aces in his four matches, including 13 in the final.  World number nine Verdasco was impressed by his opponent. He said: "He has good potential and he has one of the best serves, and also on the baseline he plays so aggressive.  "The moments he needs to play solid, he plays solid and I think that he can be a top 20 player very soon."

New Delhi, India Authorities have completed an autopsy of Ram Singh, one of the men accused of gang raping and fatally beating a woman on a New Delhi bus.  Police have said Singh hanged himself in jail cell in Tihar Prison on Monday. His lawyer and parents claim he was murdered.  It is unclear when the results of the autopsy will be released.  "Ram Singh did not kill himself. He was murdered," Singh's father, Mangi Lai, told CNN affiliate CNN-IBN on Monday.  Singh's death in custody sparked harsh criticism of India's prison system.  "If prisons are to be considered rational institutions, rather than horrible holding pens, then prisoners' rights should be of utmost importance, and their protection the state's strongly held commitment," wrote The Indian Express newspaper in an editorial Tuesday.  According to the country's National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), India had 1,382 jails in 2011 with a total capacity to hold 332,782 inmates.  However, the occupancy rate in those jails was around 112% that year, data posted on the bureau website show.  Last year, Tihar Prison recorded 18 deaths, including two suicides, according to CNN-IBN.  Authorities say Singh was the driver of the bus aboard which several men brutally raped a 23-year-old woman on December 16.  The gang rape, and the woman's subsequent death from injuries, prompted angry protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks.  Police charged Singh and four other men with murder, rape and kidnapping.  Their trial began in February. If convicted, the men could face the death penalty.  A sixth suspect is 17 and will be tried separately in juvenile court.  The December rape gripped India and led to calls for stricter laws on sexual assault and changes in cultural attitudes toward women.  Many Indian women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations.  
 One of the UK's most critically endangered butterflies is making a comeback thanks to a profit making partnership between private landowners and conservation organizations.  The heath fritillarya rare species exclusive to the south of England that thrives in cleared woodland environmentshas declined sharply over the past 25 years as forest clearing has become less common.  But population numbers are on the rise again after the introduction of a forestry management scheme that enables rural landowners to cash in by creating butterfly habitats on their property.  "We were down to 12 colonies (of heath fritillary) in 1995 and most of those were very small," says Dr. Martin Warren, chief executive of Butterfly Conservation, the organization behind the projects implementation.  "Since then we've been able to work with landowners to get the management back up again and we are now looking at 25 colonies in the same area."  See also: Butterfly farmers help protect threatened forests  The conservation scheme works by first sourcing locations where there are remnants of heath fritillary colonies.  Those who own the land identified during this processbe they individuals, businesses or wildlife trustsare then approached for permission to carry out the conservation work.  This primarily consists of clearing the areas pinpointed of their indigenous plant life and repopulating them with the lighter foliage the heath fritillary requires to prosper.  If landowners agree to take part in the project, they are then able to sell on the discarded lumber that accumulates during the clearing and ensuing maintenance process at a profit.  See also: Brazil tries to balance farming and forests  "A lot of this is about persuasion," says Warren. "You have to deal with loads of different people who all have their own agenda and financial constraints."  "When you go in there and say 'there is a rare butterfly on your land' you can sometimes get a very bad response," he adds.  Although Warren admits the profit margins remain relatively small at this stage and that the scheme itself relies on grants from the Forestry Commission to break even, he sees potential for much larger projects in the future.  He says that there are currently numerous sites throughout the UKwhere nearly three quarters of butterfly species have seen their numbers decline in the last 10 yearsbeing scouted for their suitability by Butterfly Conservation.  There are also scores of endangered butterfly species across Europe that could benefit from the implementation of similar cleared woodland schemes, he adds.  See also: Can wooden skyscrapers transform concrete jungle?  "There are a whole suite of them (countries) where woodlands are not being managed to the detriment of butterflies," says Warren.  Yet despite his enthusiasm for the project, Warren cautions that there must be a balance struck between maintaining natural forest environments and manipulating their makeup through woodland clearing.  "We wouldn't advocate every woodland area be managed as there are many other species that depend on mature woodland to thrive," he says.  If an equilibrium between profit, species conservation and respecting natural forest ecosystems can be achieved however, all kinds of diverse forest wildlife could benefit, he adds.

Washington As the United States negotiated with countries around the world to find new homes for the remaining detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Kuwait's minister of interior had a solution for the four Kuwaiti citizens left in the prison.  "You picked them up in Afghanistan; you should drop them off in Afghanistan," Shaikh Jaber Al-Khalid Al-Sabah is quoted as saying, "in the middle of the war zone," where the detainees could be killed in combat.  The 2009 cable titled "The Interior Minister's remedy for terrorists: Let them die," is among the diplomatic documents posted online by WikiLeaks.  In it, Al-Sabah is quoted as expressing concerns about his country's ability to hold the Guantanamo detainees.  "You know better than I that we cannot deal with these people. I can't detain them," said Al-Sabah. "If I take their passports, they will sue to get them. I can talk to you into next week about building a rehabilitation center, but it won't happen. ... They are rotten and the best thing to do is get rid of them."  The cable reflects the difficult position the Kuwaiti government was in regarding the detainees and its problems in "apprehending and detaining terror financiers and facilitators under Kuwait's current legal and political framework."  Facing pressure to "bring their boys home," as the cable puts it, Kuwait's inability to keep the suspected terrorists in custody was a difficult and embarrassing issue, as exemplified by the case of Mohammed al-Bathali.  Al-Bathali, a self-confessed jihadi recruiter and terror financier, had been sentenced to serve three to five years for "'inciting jihad' against a friend state." But he was released on bond.  In a different cable from the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh there is a discussion regarding the recidivism rate of Guantanamo detainees returned to Saudi Arabia who then passed through the country's rehabilitation program. Of the 119 detainees who went through the program, the cable reports, the overall rate of recidivism was 8 to 10 percent, according to the 2009 cable.  "The real story of the Saudi rehabilitation program is one of success: at least 90 percent of its graduates appear to have given up jihad and reintegrated into Saudi society," the cable says. "The recidivists are the exception, not the rule."  The cable does acknowledge however, that it was more difficult to rehabilitate former Guantanamo detainees than others.  In another creative solution for the detainees, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah proposed to implant a Bluetooth-like device into former Guantanamo detainees to track their movements.  During a March 22, 2009, meeting between U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor John Brennan and King Abdullah, the king suggested an "electronic chip" be implanted in the detainees to allow for tracking their movements as is done with Saudi horses and falcons.  According to the cable, Brennan deflected the idea, saying, "horses don't have good lawyers," pointing out that such a proposal would face legal hurdles in the United States.  The relocation of 17 Chinese Muslim Uyghurs detained at Guantanamo Bay also was a thorny issue for the United States, according to the WikiLeaks cables. Attempts to find new homes for those detainees was met with resistance because of fear of retribution from China.  At one point, Germany considered accepting seven of the Uyghurs. But the government was "subsequently warned by China of 'a heavy burden on bilateral relations'" between Germany and China if the Germans accepted the detainees.  According to one cable, German Chancellery Security and Foreign Policy Advisor Christoph Heusgen said relocation of the Uyghurs "would be 'too difficult,' but Germany could probably accept '2-3 others' from Guantanamo.  The document also summarized Heusgen as saying, "if Germany were to take any [Uyghurs], it would be best to do so in combination with other European countries to prevent China from focusing its opposition on any one country."  In another cable, this one from the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, the Chinese ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, Zhang Yannian, is quoted as calling America's refusal to relocate the detainees to China a "slap in the face."  The missive quotes Zhang as saying, "Releasing 17 from Guantanamo is an unfriendly act toward us."  "He then went on at length about what a 'slap in the face' it was to China that the Uyghur detainees were not going to be returned to their homeland but instead shipped to Germany, where reportedly they had already been granted refugee status," the cable says.  It goes on to say that Zhang "did imply that the Guantanamo situation had made China look for ways to hit back at the U.S."  The 17 Uyghurs were eventually relocated to Palau, Bermuda, Albania and Switzerland.  
 WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal from a female death row inmate who said fetal alcohol syndrome should have been considered by the state court that reviewed her sentence.  The U.S. Supreme Court has closely monitored Louisiana's capital punishment system in recent years.  The justices gave no reason for rejecting the appeal, which challenged the constitutionality of Louisiana's capital sentencing procedures and argued that Brandy Holmes' alleged developmental disabilities should disqualify her from execution.  Holmes, 29, is one of two women scheduled to be executed in Louisiana. She and a male co-defendant were convicted of murder in the New Year's Day 2003 death of Julian Brandon, a retired minister near Shreveport. Holmes is being held at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women at St. Gabriel.  Experts on fetal alcohol syndrome call it the nation's leading preventable cause of mental retardation. As many as 40,000 newborns in the United States are affected each year by their mother's alcohol use, according to an advocacy group. The syndrome can lead to brain damage, behavioral problems and intellectual disabilities.  Holmes' attorneys said she functions like a 10- to 12-year-old.  "Brandy has a hallmark case of FAS," said Tom Donaldson, president of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, which supported the defendant in her high court appeal.  "Her mother testified that she drank throughout her pregnancy, and in fact named her daughter after her favorite drink. Brandy's capacity to appreciate the criminality of her actions or to conform to the law is very seriously impaired."  Donaldson and others argue the medical and legal system is unprepared to recognize, intervene and educate when presented with the majority of FAS-related cases, especially those involving younger defendants.  In a petition to the justices, Holmes' attorney, Charles Ogletree, argued the Louisiana Supreme Court did not "review the extensive mitigating circumstances that limited Ms. Holmes's moral culpability and compare them to the mitigating circumstances presented in similar cases. The [state] court also failed to consider that petitioner's co-defendant received a death sentence and that the prosecutor stated at the co-defendant's trial that he (and not the petitioner) was the more culpable party."  That co-defendant, Robert Coleman, remains on death row at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.  Ogletree is a noted Harvard Law School professor who taught President Obama when he was a law student.  The state in its reply brief noted the violent nature of the robbery-murder. The victim's wife also suffered gunshot wounds in the attack. She lived in a severely impaired state for years and passed away in October 2008.  Investigators said Holmes tried to use the victims' ATM card and destroyed evidence of the crime. Detectives said she even stole a videotape of her confession that was left unattended at the police station.  "Holmes destroyed this tape by sneaking it into the ladies' room and flushing the magnetic tape down the toilet, after substituting a blank tape in the stack of taped statements that had been left unsecured on a detective's desk," according the the state's brief.  Police also suspect she flushed jewelry she had been wearing, which they suggested may have been stolen from the Brandons.  The Supreme Court previously had banned execution of the mentally retarded, though the justices established no clear benchmark on IQ test results to guide criminal courts.  The justices also have closely monitored Louisiana's capital punishment system in recent years, criticizing in some cases the role of some prosecutors and the procedural guarantees required in such cases.  The justices last year ordered a new trial for an African-American capital defendant after finding problems with how prosecutors excluded blacks from an all-white jury. That same year, the high court blocked use of the death penalty for a New Orleans-area man convicted of child rape. Louisiana was one of the few states that had actively pushed execution for nonhomicide crimes.  Fifty-three women remain on death row around the country. Forty women have been executed in the past century11 since 1976 when the Supreme Court restored capital punishment, according the Death Penalty Information Center.  The other woman on death row in Louisiana is Antoinette Frank, a former New Orleans policewoman convicted of three murders, including that of her former partner on the police force. Her scheduled execution last year was delayed indefinitely by appeal.  The high court also announced Monday that it will not hear appeals in the following cases:  
	 'The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal from a female death'
As someone who has had the great honor of commanding four different ships for the United States Coast Guard, I have watched the news about the Costa Concordiathe grounding of the vessel and the resulting death of at least 11 peoplefrom the perspective of a seagoing captain.  We must all await the findings of a proper investigation, but for anyone remotely familiar with a captain's awesome responsibilities for the lives of his passengers and crew, the reported behavior of the Concordia's skipper, Francesco Schettino, is almost unfathomable.  The captain of a ship at sea is one of the last bastions of total authority in this world. The ocean is a dangerous place, where life and death decisions often need to be made in an instant. For this reason, a sea captain is granted complete independence, power, and control aboard his vessel.  But with that absolute authority comes absolute responsibility. In the case of a cruise ship, thousands of passengers have come aboard with the expectation that they are in the hands of a competent crew headed by a competent captain. They are depending on his professionalism, skill and dedication to his one and only mission: to navigate his vessel safely and prudently from point A to point B.  To meet that mission, a modern sea captain is provided with all kinds of resources. He is given extraordinary training for the challenges of the waters he is in and the vessel he is commanding. He is given extraordinary electronic gadgetry that allows him to fix his position on the globe within inches. He receives all sorts of input informationweather reports, charts detailing virtually every hazard in his area of operation, and detailed information on pathways to take and pathways to avoidall of which arm him to make good judgments as to where he is going.  The captain of the Costa Concordia had all these resources at his disposal, and yet audio recordings and other accounts appear to show him violating every commonly accepted notion of how a captain will behave in a crisis.  First, he came in close to the island in spite of the obvious navigational challenges that meant in terms of safe passage. It is a captain's responsibility to err on the side of safety. When I commanded Coast Guard cutters undertaking hazardous military missions, I invariably chose the safer path whenever I had the opportunity to do so. The captain of a cruise ship, whose sole mission is the safe transport of your passengers, has no excuse to choose anything but the safest path.  Second, the chaos that followed the grounding of the ship appears to reflect the captain's lack of leadership aboard his vessel. By all accounts he failed to institute a command structure in which his crew was prepared to do their duty to organize the passengers for a safe embarkation from a sinking platformand as a result, 11 people are dead and more than 20 others are still missing.  Third, his personal decision to leave the vessel before his passengers had safely embarked from the ship shows a flagrant disrespect for his ultimate responsibilities as a sea captain. A captain does not necessarily have to go down with his ship, but under no circumstances does he leave his ship to save himself before he has saved those whose lives are in his hands.  Given these serial failures of responsibility, the one blessing is that the accident occurred so close to shore, which allowed so many of the passengers to reach safety on their own. One can only imagine how many might have perished had the ship run into trouble at sea with this particular captain and crew.  There will be an investigation in the aftermath. But even before it gets under way, one thing is clear: the training and promotion process that put a man like this in command of a passenger ship missed the character flaw that allowed him to jeopardize his vessel for some apparently transient and empty purpose. That promotion system is in need of serious repair.  When I first heard about the Costa Concordia, I thought back to the guidance that Alexander Hamilton provided in 1790 to the captains of the first 10 cutters of the U.S. Revenue Marinethe precursor to the Coast Guard. Hamilton advised that they had been "selected with careful attention to character" and told them to "Refrain from haughtiness, rudeness, or insult" and to "Endeavor to overcome difficulties by a cool and temperate perseverance in your duty." He declared that a captain's demeanor and behavior must "be marked with prudence, moderation, and good temper. Upon these qualities must depend the success, usefulness and ... continuance of the establishment in which they are included."  An off duty captain, Roberto Bosio, happened to be on board the Costa Concordia when it ran aground and swung into action, helping dozens of women and children into lifeboats. He has been called a hero in the Italian press, but rejects the moniker. "Don't call me a hero. I just did my duty, the duty of a sea captain," he said. Captain Bosio met Alexander Hamilton's charge. Captain Schettino failed to do so in every imaginable way.  Join CNN Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on Twitter.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Loy.  
 Three debates down. Two weeks of campaigning to go.  President Barack Obama put Republican challenger Mitt Romney on the defensive on foreign policy in the final presidential debate Monday night, with analysts and an immediate poll giving Obama the victory.  With 15 days before the November 6 vote, the candidates now hit the road for the final sprint to Election Dayfocusing on the handful of vital battleground states that could decade the closely contested race.  Obama kicks off his "America Forward" tour Tuesday with events in Florida and Ohio, where he will be joined by Vice President Joe Biden, while Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, campaign in Nevada and Colorado.  In Monday's debate, Obama sought to highlight his experience after nearly four years leading the nation's military and foreign policy efforts. Romney, a former governor with less foreign policy experience, tried to paint Obama as an ineffective leader even as he expressed agreement with many of the administration's steps in Syria, Iran and other hotspots.  Were your questions answered? Share your reactions to the final debate.  Analysts agreed that Obama won on points, but questioned if the result would have a big impact on voters and the race as a whole.  "There's no question debate coaches would score this one for the president," said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King, while CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said Obama "dominated the middle of the debate" and emerged as the winner.  Both King and Gergen agreed that Romney avoided sounding like an overzealous advocate of military actionwhich is how Obama and Democrats seek to portray him.  Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, conceded Obama "won tonight on points, no doubt about it," but added that Romney showed the leadership style of a commander-in-chief to demonstrate that making a change in the White House would be safe.  A CNN/ORC International poll of people who watched the debate showed 48% favored Obama compared to 40% for Romney, numbers barely within the margin of error range of plus-or-minus 4.5%. Another poll by CBS scored it a clear victory for Obama.  At the same time, the CNN/ORC poll showed viewers thought Romney established credibility as a leader, which former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, said was very important.  "This isn't going to change the trajectory of the result," Fleischer said, noting that 24% of those questioned said the debate made them more likely to vote for Obama while 25% said it nudged them toward Romney, and 50% said they were not influence either way.  The poll also reinforced a gender gap in the race, with women favoring Obama as a strong leader by 59% to 39%, while men chose Romney by 53% to 43%. Obama needs to repeat the strong support from women voterswho comprise half the electoratethat helped him win in 2008.  The third and final face-to-face showdown occurred with the candidates running even in national polls and the race hinging on a handful of battleground statesparticularly Ohio, Florida and Virginia.  According to the latest polls, Obama has a slight lead in Ohio. Romney is ahead in Florida, and Virginia is a dead heat.  In the debate, Obama more than once sought to highlight Romney's lack of foreign policy experience.  The president took a jab at his challenger's world viewpaying him a backhanded compliment for his analysis of the threat of terrorism to the United States.  "Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al Qaeda is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al Qaeda; you said Russia," Obama said, adding that "the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years."  Romney countered that in that speech, he had argued Iran was the nation's greatest security threat and identified Russia as a "geopolitical foe."  "Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence," he said.  Romney added that Obama's foreign affairs policies have made the United States less respected and more vulnerable, particularly as it relates to Iran.  "I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be," Romney said.  Romney also repeatedly tried to shift the discussion to his strongest issuethe continued high unemployment and slow economic recovery under Obamaarguing that a strong foreign policy and national defense depends on a strong economy.  "We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible," Romney said. "But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home."  Romney also accused Obama of supporting policies that undermine the nation's military preparedness.  "Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917," the Republican nominee said, also noting that "our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947."  Obama fired back, suggesting Romney "maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works."  "You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916," Obama said. "Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military has changed."  Sarcastically noting that the Navy now has "these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them" as well as "ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines," Obama concluded that "the question is not a game of 'Battleship,' where we're counting shipsit's what are our capabilities."  How foreign policy hits close to home  Romney applauded the Obama-approved mission that killed Osama bin Laden and his efforts to take out other al Qaeda leaders but insisted that "we can't kill our way out of this mess." Rather, he pushed for "a comprehensive strategy" to curb violent extremism in the Middle East.  "The key that we're going to have to pursue is ais a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own," Romney said, proposing U.S. policies to promote economic development, better education, gender equity and to help create institutions.  However, he was unable to express any significant policy difference with Obama on how that would happen.  Obama responded by criticizing his opponent on a host of foreign policy issuesclaiming Romney had favored positions that would have hurt the United States or offered sometimes contradictory views.  "What we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadershipnot wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map," the president said.  Read the full debate transcript  Romney's economic plan seeks trillions in tax cuts while increasing defense spending, which would increase the deficit, Obama said.  For his part, Romney repeatedly shifted back to his stump speech criticism of the nation's sluggish economic recovery under Obama's policies, which he says have hindered growth through high taxes and onerous regulations.  The candidates were at odds as well about how Washington should ultimately respond to the continuing violence in Syria.  Checking the candidates' facts on foreign policy and national security  Talking about the need to provide those fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces with arms, Romney said the Democratic incumbent has not done enough to curb violence that has left tens of thousands of people dead and also destabilized the region.  "We should be playing the leadership role," Romney said.  That precipitated a quick response from Obama, who pointed to American efforts to organize international efforts to address the issue as well as its support for opposition factions. "We are making sure that those we help will be our friends (in the future)," he said.  A strong performance by Romney against a lackluster Obama in the first debate October 3 in Denver helped the GOP challenger tighten the race and even pass the president in some polls.  Where they stand: Candidates and issues  The president fought back to win the second debate last week in New York, according to polls and pundits, setting up Monday night's showdown at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, moderated by CBS News Chief Washington Correspondent Bob Schieffer.  Until recently, polls showed Obama ahead of the former governor on foreign relations issues, and the Romney campaign has mounted pointed attacks in an attempt to narrow the president's advantage.  Other issues discussed in the debate included Iran's nuclear ambitions, China and the war in Afghanistan. Both candidates pledged to support Israel if the Jewish state comes under attack, and Romney backed the 2014 date set by Obama and NATO for withdrawing combat troops from Afghanistan.  Romney has landed blows thus far in the campaign by promoting his own business background while arguing that continued high unemployment and sluggish growth showed failed policies under the president.  CNN/Google Campaign Explorer: Ads, money and travel  In a major foreign policy address on October 8, Romney promoted a traditional U.S. foreign policy dating back decades, based on exerting global influence through military and economic power. While the speech sought to distinguish himself from Obama on foreign policy, specific proposals he cited then were similar to what the administration is doing.  Obama's campaign has accused Romney of shifting positions on foreign policy matters and mishandling a trip to England, Israel and Poland this summer when he publicly questioned London's preparedness to host the Olympic Games and cited cultural differences as a reason for economic disparities between Israelis and Palestinians.  Defense: $2 trillion divides Obama and Romney  CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

Tongchang-ri, North Korea As North Korea presses forward with a controversial rocket launch, journalists were granted a rare glimpse Sunday of the reclusive country's preparations.  CNN was part of a group taken to the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri, in the northwest part of the country.  North Korea announced last month that it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite between April 12 and 16 to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the Communist state. His birthday on April 15, known as the "Day of the Sun," is a key public holiday in the North Korean calendar.  Pyongyang says the operation is for peaceful purposes, but Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test.  Firing the long-range rocket would breach U.N. Security Council resolutions, and Washington has suspended a recent deal to provide food aid to North Korea as a result. Japan has said it will shoot down any part of the rocket that enters its territory.  "If you look for yourselves with your own eyes, then you can judge whether it's a ballistic missile, or whether it's a launch vehicle to put a satellite into orbit," Jang Myong Jin, head of the launch site, said through a translator. "That's why we've invited you to this launch site."  Journalistswho were not allowed to take laptops or cell phones to the site, but were permitted to filmwere shown the control center and the satellite that officials said would be shot into space.  The rocket itself is 30 meters, or about 100 feet, long. It was white, with some red and blue paint.  International leaders have urged North Korea to cancel the launch, but Pyongyang has refused to back down, insisting that the operation is for scientific purposes.  The last time Pyongyang carried out what it described as a satellite launch, in April 2009, the U.N. Security Council condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated.  An independent European analyst who visited the launch site said he saw nothing obvious that raised red flags.  "I don't know what they want to do in the future, but today what we see is a space launcher," said Christian Lardier.  
 Singer-songwriter Jack Johnson released a new album on April 17 in honor of Earth Day called "Jack Johnson and Friends: Best of Kokua Festival." It's a collection of live highlights from the festival over the years featuring some legendary names in music: Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne, Eddie Vedder and Dave Matthews.  But the album is about more than just music. The proceeds from both the festival and the album go back to Johnson's Kokua Hawaii Foundation to promote conservation efforts in Hawaii.  Johnson and his wife, Kim, are natives of Hawaii, and for years they have been champions of conservation, environmental awareness and education both in their native state and around the world.  "We decided to create the foundation because I stole my wife away from teaching geometry and she became my first tour manager, and ... she wanted to be involved in education again." Johnson said. Their foundation got them both back into Hawaiian classrooms.  The Kokua Hawaii Foundation supports environmental education in schools and communities throughout Hawaii. The main programs the foundation has implemented since its creation in 2003 promote recycling and taking children out of the classroom and into the environment for hands-on learning experiences. Most recently, the foundation introduced the Plastic Free Schools program to reduce single-use plastic on the Hawaiian Islands.  "The Kokua Hawaii Foundation's programs are really hands-on and get kids out into nature. Usually, they are having so much fun that they don't realize how much they are learning," Johnson said.  To raise money for the foundation, the Johnsons created the Kokua Festival in 2004. The festival is held every year on Earth Day weekend outdoors in Honolulu's Waikiki Shell. Johnson brings in friends in the music industry who share his passion for environmental preservation.  "All of the musicians who've played at the Kokua Festival have a connection to the cause and the work we are doing with the foundation," Johnson says. "The musicians themselves were a big inspiration for the foundation from the startlike how Willie Nelson runs his tour buses and trucks on biodiesel and how Eddie Vedder has been active in several environmental causes."  "For me, it's wonderful to get the chance to play with these musicians I respect and have loved for years, to share some great music with them and use that music to help raise funds we need to keep Kokua Hawaii Foundation's programs going. Hopefully, that inspiration goes both ways, and the musicians who join us will implement some of the greening measures from the festival into their own tours."  In addition to the music, the festival also continues in the educational tradition of the foundation. More than 50 eco-friendly businesses and local environmental groups set up shop in the Kokua Village, which is much like what Johnson does on tour. Here, the fans can learn about sustainable products, watch alternative energy demonstrations and sample local food and beverages.  Another element that mirrors Johnson's efforts on tour: There are free water refill stations to encourage the use of reusable water bottles.

Most Americans probably still believe the biggest threat to our national security is terrorism. We're debating increasingly intrusive security measures, and not long ago we heard about a homegrown terrorist in Oregon who wanted to cause a huge explosion at a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony.  Yet Mexican drug cartels are arguably as dangerous and deadly as terrorists, and they were operating far inside our borders well before 9/11.  The decision to go into Afghanistan was an easy one to make; or at least it was in 2001.  Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, America learned all about al Qaeda. We were prepared to do whatever it took, spend whatever it cost, and deploy tens of thousands of our soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen to effectively and efficiently do the job.  It seems like the job they've been doing is working, to an extent. We haven't experienced a large terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11 and al Qaeda is a shadow of its former self. But do we know for a fact that our presence in Afghanistan is the exact thing that's preventing more terrorist attacks? Maybe, and maybe not.  Most people don't want to take chances, and most people would say that terrorism is still the biggest threat to our national security.  I beg to differ.  Let's switch gears for a minute to the drug war in Mexico, where more than 30,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Caldern came into office and the annual body count goes up every December. Granted, most of the people being tortured, kidnapped or killed have historically been criminals involved in the drug trade. However, that's changing. We're seeing more and more innocent bystanders, including children, being gunned down as collateral damage.  The big concern, of course, is whether the violence is going to spill over into the United States. But there are two real problems with this debate. First, no standardized definition exists as to what constitutes border violence spillover. It really is in the eye of the beholder, which means that if you ask a Texas city mayor and an Arizona rural border county sheriff whether they're seeing it, you're likely going to get two very different answers.  The second problem is that we're too focused on spillover in the border area to realize that Mexican drug cartels have deeply infiltrated every corner of the United States, and they did so well before terrorism and religious extremists entered our national consciousness. According to the U.S. Department of Justice's National Drug Intelligence Center, members of Mexican cartels are operating in more than 270 U.S. cities and thousands of smaller communities.  Those same cartels dominate drug trafficking operations in places like Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston, Chicago, Detroit, Denver, Atlanta and Newark, New Jersey. Violent gangs across the country act as their proxies and sell Mexican drugs like marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, brown powder and black tar heroin, and Colombian cocaine in our cities and neighborhoods from San Diego to Syracuse, New York.  So why don't we hear more in the media about the activities of Mexican cartels on U.S. soil? Mostly because cartels like to keep a low profile and blend in. Drawing attention to cartel operations in the United States is very bad for business and our law enforcement officers can generally be depended on to do their jobs. A big shootout in a San Diego shopping district or downtown Houston between dozens of heavily armed cartel gunmen and the U.S. Army isn't going to happen any time soon.  But that doesn't mean drug-related violence isn't happening in the United States, and sometimes well away from the border.  In 2009, five mutilated bodies were found outside a drug stash house in a well-to-do northern Alabama county. Dozens of law enforcement officers have been shot at and many severely injured by heavily armed men who work for Mexican cartels defending marijuana crops in states like Oregon, Tennessee and North Carolina.  Closer to the border, last year, gang members from "Los Palillos" were indicted in the kidnapping, torture and murder of nine people in San Diego County. Two of those victims were dissolved in vats of acid after they were killed.  This is the real and current major threat to our national securitytens of thousands of violent Mexican cartel members who are living and operating under our noses in our cities, communities and public lands.  We've spent more than $365 billion on the war in Afghanistan since 2001, and about 1,400 military members have lost their lives in the process. We've committed only $1.6 billion to the drug war in Mexicoonly a few hundred million of which has actually been spent since 2007and our military isn't allowed to step one foot in-country unless it's for training purposes.  In a time when our national deficit is skyrocketing and the collective belt is tightening, we need to take a good look at our priorities when it comes to national security.  So can our commitments to Afghanistan and Mexico be compared? Maybe, maybe not.  We know the number of innocent Americans who died as a result of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. But we also have a rough idea of how many Americans die every year as a result of using drugs being peddled by Mexican cartels operating in our country. I can assure you that the number of American drug casualties is much higher.  We also need to take into account the cost of interdicting even a small percentage of those drugs at the border, as well as the environmental toll that domestic marijuana cultivation is taking on our nation's landscape.  Afghanistan and Mexico can't be compared in the ways we're fighting those wars, but they certainly can in the ways our government chooses to assess and protect us from the threats they pose.

 (EW.com)You know what happens in "Taken 2," don't you? The same thing that happened four years ago in Taken, but different. (But the same.)  Directed by French tough-stuff Transporter 3 specialist Olivier Megaton, the movie is simultaneously silly, nasty, a lazy festival of stereotypes, and a cleverly made piece of merchandise  i.e., it's the devil we know. This time the blithely violent revenge thriller takes place in Istanbul, which, like Paris in the original, is infested with evil stubbled Albanian gangsters. And now it's retired CIA intel pro Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen) who get taken too. Miraculously, the couple's singularly hostage-prone daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), avoids captivity, and even proves a worthy bad-guy opponent, primarily through the use of her near-magic iPhone.  By the way, the chief evil stubbled Albanian gangster, Murad Hoxha (Rade Serbedzija, who is Croatian), wants revenge because Bryan killed his son in the previous movie after that son kidnapped Bryan's daughter to force her into prostitution. Suffice it to say, things do not go well for Murad. Chained up and locked away along with his ex-missus, Bryan, with his very specialized set of skills, nevertheless wriggles free. Then, on the way to rescuing his ex, he alternately beats the crap out of people, shoots the crap out of people, runs the crap over people, and growls the crap out of people.  Anyone who thinks any of the above constitutes a spoiler is not the audience for the phenomenon of the "Taken" oeuvre, a pair of icy-eyed movies laid over a gooey core of aspirational family bonding. In these films, by sheer dint of will, strategic career planning, and physical training sessions suited to his now 60-year-old chassis, Neeson sets himself the goal of becoming a Harrison Ford-like action hero. And this he does: He's sturdy, solid, efficient, opaque, and wears a black leather jacket well. Ta-da. He's an action hero. (Seems like a waste of a career arc to me, but guess who's the millionaire?)  The apex of the star's work here is when he manages not to betray a giggle when directed to whisper into the phone to the perpetually edge-of-panicked Maggie Grace, ''Your mother and I are going to be taken. Listen to me very carefully.'' As Oscar Wilde almost said in "The Importance of Being Earnest," to be taken once may be regarded as a misfortune; to be taken twice looks like carelessness.

Brussels, Belgium (FT.com)Brussels competition officials have formally cleared the global tie-up between British Airways, American Airlines and Spain's Iberia as well as giving a green light to the merger between BA and Iberia, saying it would not significantly impede competition in Europe.  The moves were welcome by Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways. The global alliance still needs a final green light from the US authorities, but Mr Walsh said that the EU approval was an "important and vital step forward".  "The high number of new services on London to US routes since the open skies agreement demonstrates that Heathrow is open. Between us, we have agreed to make available Heathrow slot pairs for our competitors to use on services to the US. This is a pragmatic decision, so that we can get the joint business up and running as soon as possible. The slot commitments provide a further guarantee that there will be no possible loss of competition as a result of our joint business", he said.  The move comes after more than a year of analysis. The European Commission first announced that it was looking at the alliance in April last year, along with the rival Star Alliance, which includes United Airlines, Continental Airlines and Lufthansa.  At the time, the commission said that the level of co-operation envisaged between BA, American and Iberia appeared to be more extensive than among the alliance members generallyand stretched to joint management of schedules, capacity and pricing on transatlantic routes, as well as revenue-sharing on these routes.  Officials were anxious to find out whether the co-operation would generate offsetting consumer benefits.  But in February, officials in Brussels started consulting on concessions the three carriers offered to address potential anti-competitive implications of the deal, and in March put these out for public commenta move that signalled likely eventual approval for the deal.  Under the concessions offered by the airlines, seven daily slot pairs will be made available to other carriers. These will comprise three on the London-New York route, two on London-Boston and one on each of London-Miami and London-Dallas. This will allow one or more competitors to operate a total of 49 return flights between London and the four US destinations a week. On the London-New York pair, the carriers will also provide the competing carrier with slots at New York's JFK airport.  In addition, the three airlines will provide access to their frequent-flyer programmes on the relevant routes; allow the combining of fares, so that competitors can carry passengers one way on their own planes and back on the alliance's flights; and conclude special pro-rate agreements, making it easier for a passenger to connect from the alliance's short-haul European flights to a competitor's transatlantic flight.  The commitments, which are legally binding, will run for 10 years.  
 Washington President Barack Obama warned Tuesday of "difficult days ahead" for Egypt and said the transition following President Hosni Mubarak's earlier announcement that he won't run for re-election in September must begin immediately.  In a brief statement to reporters at the White House, Obama pledged continuing U.S. support for both a longtime ally and the aspirations of protesting Egyptians, whose eight days of growing demonstrations led to Mubarak's dramatic announcement on state television.  "We've borne witness to the beginning of a new chapter in the history of a great country and a long-time partner of the United States," Obama said of the Mubarak statement less than three hours earlier.  Noting that he and Mubarak had just spoken by phone, Obama said Mubarak "recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and a change must take place." Repeating earlier calls for an orderly transition in Egypt from Mubarak's nearly three decades of repressive rule to a fully representative democracy, Obama said the transition "must be meaningful, it must be peaceful and it must begin now."  "Furthermore, the process must include a broad spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties," Obama said. "It should lead to elections that are free and fair. And it should result in a government that's not only grounded in democratic principles but is also responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people."  Earlier, sources told CNN that a U.S. envoy sent by Obama urged Mubarak to announce he won't run for re-election later this year, a major shift in foreign policy regarding the main Arab ally of the United States and a vital partner in the Middle East peace process because of its 1978 treaty with Israel.  According to the sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified by name, former U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Frank Wisner conveyed the message to Mubarak in Egypt. It was unclear if the meeting was Monday or Tuesday.  Until now, the street demonstrations in Egypt demanding Mubarak's ouster had drawn a measured U.S. response that advocated step-by-step reforms for pro-democracy changes while maintaining stability.  This week, though, calls increased for the Obama administration to push for Mubarak to step aside immediately or announce he would not be a candidate in the next presidential election scheduled for September.  One of Egypt's leading opposition figures, Mohamed ElBaradei, warned Monday that the United States needed to "let go" of its longtime ally.  "You shouldn't be behind the curve, and you need to start building confidence with the people and not with the people who are smothering the people," ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360."  The unrest in Egypt presented Obama with a complex issue that lacked easy answers.  Egyptthe main Arab ally of the United Statesis inexorably linked to neighboring Israelthe main U.S. ally in the Middle Eastby a peace treaty that guarantees more than $1 billion a year in U.S. military aid to Mubarak's government.  Egypt also provides vital logistical and intelligence assistance to the United States, which has urged Mubarak for years to implement democratic reforms but always put the strategic benefits first.  Daniel Kurtzer, the U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 1997 to 2001, said the administration wants to both support "an exceedingly strong ally" and promote democratic reform and more openness in "a closed authoritarian society."  "The United States is trying to find comfortable ground in which we can argue for both without abandoning an ally and without abandoning our principles," Kurtzer told CNN on Monday.  Egypt's turmoil follows years of social, political and economic grievances that fueled the street protests that began last week and have since escalated. After ruling with an iron fist for three decades, Mubarak had given no indication of giving up power before his statement Tuesday night.  However, ElBaradei and other opposition figures immediately condemned Mubarak's announcement as insufficient, saying the president needed to step aside immediately for a caretaker government of national unity to lead Egypt until new presidential and parliamentary elections can be held.  Obama's statement avoided addressing the opposition demands, instead promising the demonstratorsparticularly young Egyptians looking to the United States for support and leadershipthat America supported their aspirations.  "We hear your voices," Obama said. "I have an unyielding belief that you will determine your own destiny and seize the promise of a better future for your children and your grandchildren. And I say that as someone who is committed to a partnership between the United States and Egypt.  "There will be difficult days ahead," Obama continued. "Many questions about Egypt's future remain unanswered, but I am confident that the people of Egypt will find those answers."  In the past week, demonstrators in Egypt have questioned why Obama, who championed human rights and democracy in a 2009 speech in Cairo, wasn't condemning Mubarak and applying pressure to help bring the changes they seek.  ElBaradei, who returned to his native Egypt last week as an opposition figure last week, said Egyptians need to see that the United States is supporting their aspirations.  "People need to see that you not only talk the talk, but walk the walk, and people need to understand and believe that you really, seriously take democracy, rule of law, freedoms seriously," ElBaradei said Sunday. Asking "a dictator" to implement democratic reforms "is an oxymoron, frankly."  On Monday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Egypt's government should engage in "meaningful negotiations with a broad section of civil society, including opposition groups," and hold "free and fair elections" in September.  The transition called for by the United States "means change, and what we've advocated from the very beginning is that the way Egypt looks and operates must change," Gibbs told reporters.  At the same time, he said it is not the place of the United States to support or oppose the possible ouster of Mubarak.  Some U.S. politicians disagreed. One of the U.S. Senate's most influential foreign policy voices, Democrat John Kerry of Massachusetts, called Tuesday for Mubarak to step down, reflecting the rapidly changing consensus among top Washington policymakers.  Kerry, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, also said Mubarak's son, Gamal, should not take the reins of power in Cairo.  The U.S. government needs to start paying closer attention to the "genuine political, legal and economic needs" of people in the Middle East, as opposed to consistently supporting friendly governments regardless of their domestic politics, Kerry said in an op-ed commentary published by the New York Times.  "For three decades, the United States pursued a Mubarak policy," he wrote. "Now we must look beyond the Mubarak era and devise an Egyptian policy."  To Marina Ottaway, director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the unrest in Egypt showed that the U.S. policy of backing Mubarak despite his poor record on political and human rights has failed to bring desired stability.  Instead of what she labeled "subtle" language such as endorsing an orderly transition, the United States should call for a government of national unity to take over until fully democratic elections for both the presidency and the parliament, Ottaway told CNN on Monday.

MEXICO CITY, Mexico   Mexicans in the United States sent home 12.2 percent less money this past August than the same month last year, the Banco de Mexico said Wednesday.  Mexicans in the U.S. are sending fewer dollars home and are suffering from a tough economy.  That translates into remittances of $1.9 billion, versus $2.2 billion last year, said the bank, which blamed tough economic times in the United States for the decline.  "The prolonged deceleration of economic activity in the United States has adversely affected the opportunities for employment in that country and, consequently, those of the Mexican migrants," the bank said in a statement posted on its Web site.  August's tally quickens a trendduring the first eight months of the year, remittances fell 4 percent to $15.6 billion, the statement said.  The numbers translate easily into stories of hardship. Marilyn Pena lives outside Mexico City and depends on remittances to get by. Her father migrated to Chicago 12 years ago to find work and, in good months, sends his daughter about $200 per week.  But last week he sent nothing. "He told me he has no more work because of the situation there," Pena said.  "Temporary workers are always the first to lose their jobs in crises like this one," said Luis Pena, an economist. "Since many Mexicans in the United States are there illegally, they are most vulnerable to unemployment."  Some economists predict the drop will increase by year's end to 20 percent.  After oil exports, remittances are Mexico's second-largest source of foreign currency.  In Atlanta, Georgia, which has one of the greatest concentrations of Mexican residents in the southeastern United States, Yasmin Gutierrez runs a company that Mexican immigrants use to send dollars abroad.  "Before, they used to come every week and they used to send big amounts and lately, well, nothing, or almost nothing. Some clients are no longer coming, and those that are coming are sending small amounts."  Rosina Gonzalez, who ran a Western Union office in Atlanta several years ago and recently returned to the job, said she has noticed a big change.  Back then, "everyone was sending money to Mexico, Mexico, Mexicoa lot of money," she said.  "Now, I'm returning to work after four or five years and the norm now is that the people who used to send money to Mexico are asking the people in Mexico to send money here."  Some are abandoning their hope for a slice of the American dream by opting to return to their country.  The woman running the foreign-currency exchange service Afex, also in Atlanta, said business is so bad she is afraid of losing her job.  CNN's Harris Whitbeck in Mexico City and Viviana Fernandez in Atlanta contributed to this story.  
 The fight is said to have lasted a half-hour and pitted a leopard against a woman armed only with a farm tool in an isolated field in India.  Kalama Devi, at 54 years old, won.  Devi, a widow and mother of one, has been telling her story from a hospital bed in Srinagar, in Uttarakhand state, where she's being treated for fractures, swelling, scratches and cuts to her skull that have required 50 stitches.  "I held the leopard with my hands, it then bit my hand and then left it. ... Both my hands are in immense pain and I am not able to lift them up," she said.  According to the doctor who's treating her, the leopard pounced about 10 a.m. Sunday as Devi, who had been cutting grass with a sickle, walked through a field in the village of Koti Badma, in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand.  It fractured her left hand first, so with her right hand clutching the sickle she repeatedly hit the animalfor about 30 minutes.  Exhausted and bleeding  She said she kept pounding the leopard until she ran out of energy, then, exhausted and bleeding, limped one kilometer to a nearby village to seek help, Dr. Abdul Rahul at the HNB Base Hospital in Srinagar told CNN.  Villagers found the leopard dead when they went to the scene of the reported attack, the doctor said.  It's not the first leopard attack in the area, Rahul said, though he added it was more common to see injuries as the result of attacks by bears.  Another woman was recently killed by a young male cat, which was shot dead by hunters, according to Digvijay Khati, chief wildlife warden in Uttarakhand.  "These are alarming incidents because usually leopards attack and kill dogs, goats or young childrennot adults," Khati told CNN.  He said the big cats' natural habitat is shrinking, and their natural prey are becoming scarce.  However, Khatis said, "We cannot say that the increase of human population in the areas is responsible, because attacks have even occurred where human population is less, and people are now moving out to the plains in search of work," he said.

Nairobi, Kenya Revenge attacks targeting a village in southeast Kenya killed 10 people Thursday, including women and children, the nation's Red Cross said.  The deaths occurred in Tana River district , the latest in a series of attacks in the area.  Read more: Dozens of Kenyans killed in dawn raid  A day earlier, nine others died in an attack that left homes torched in a nearby village, according to the Kenyan Red Cross.  Attacks and revenge raids have soared in the region in recent months.

Pokomos are largely farmers while the semi-nomadic Orma tribesmen mostly tend to livestock.  The former have accused the latter of grazing cattle on land that does not belong to them.  Violence between the two escalated after an August confrontation killed more than 50 people in the same region.  Kenya has dispatched hundreds of officers to the area in recent months, but authorities in the east African nation have been criticized for failing to stop the carnage.

 Lots of sexy, glamorous and irresistible characters make their way through "Downton Abbey"the television drama that's got audiences around the world fascinated by the intrigue inside an English manor house.  But to many fans, the castle is the real star.  So much so that it's transforming some viewers into travelers, eager to see for themselves what it might be like to live as a blue-blood or as a servant at the great mansion.  First stop: Highclere Castle, the fairytale-like 19th century property about an hour's drive west of London used as the setting for the series and part-time home of the eighth Earl and Countess of Carnarvon.  "It has been amazing," said Lady Fiona Carnarvon, describing the effect "Downton Abbey" has had on the family's life and the tourist demand to see the castle.  "We have so many e-mails now saying 'We love your home.'"  'Like walking into Hogwarts'  More than e-mails are pouring in. About 50,000 people came to see the house last year, compared to about 30,000 who visited before the series began airing in the U.K. in fall 2010, Lady Carnarvon said. American audiences see the show a few months later.  (The series has also inspired the countess to write "Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey," a book about a predecessor who converted Highclere into a hospital during World War I.)  Tourist demand is so great that the family is now asking visitors to buy admission in advance and is installing a timed ticket system to avoid having too many people inside the castle at one time.  Group visits are already fully booked for 2012, but individuals will be able to pre-book their tickets online starting next month.  Even the "Downton Abbey" actors are in awe of the setting.  "It's like walking into Hogwarts or something like that in 'Harry Potter,'" said Rob James-Collier, who plays the scheming footman-turned-sergeant Thomas Barrow in the series, in an interview with a British video production company last fall.  "It's the center of the whole show around which everybody else revolves," added Hugh Bonneville, who plays the Earl of Grantham.  YouTube: Watch the making of "Downton Abbey"  For Lady Carnarvon, opening up her beautiful 300-room home to so many visitors just goes with the territory of being part of an aristocratic family.  "I think you have to look positively on it or you've married the wrong husband," she said.  "You have to want to share it, which we do."  Showcasing the countryside  Tourists aren't the only ones glad the family is sharing the estate.  The popularity of "Downton Abbey" is just the latest boost for the British travel industry, which has been riding high since the royal wedding last spring and continues to be red-hot with the approach of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in June and the Summer Olympic Games to be held in London in July.  "Downton" is especially good at showing visitors that there is more to Britain than just "London-centric" landmarks, said Meredith Pearson, a spokeswoman for VisitBritain, the country's national tourism agency.  "This is just the most exciting time for British tourism. It's an unprecedented period of time to have so many incredible events taking place at the same time," Person said.  "[Now] 'Downton Abbey' is really showcasing the beauty of our countryside and quaint villages and all of the manor houses across the country. ... We had no idea that it would take on a life of its own. It's just become so popular."  There are lots of options if you want to visit Highclere Castle.  The house and gardens are generally open to the public on select days from Easter until September.  Since the castle was once the home of the fifth Earl of Carnarvon, who along with Howard Carter discovered Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, the mansion also holds an Egyptian exhibition. Admission to visit the house, gardens and the exhibition costs 16 (about $25) for an adult.  For no cost, you can take walks within and near the estate.  The deluxe tour  Then again, if you'd like to get a more intimate look at the castle, there's a new, much pricier option that's being offered by NoteWorthy Events, a travel agency that specializes in the United Kingdom.  Owner Susie Worthy calls it an exclusive tour created in response to interest in the "Masterpiece Classic" series.  Do you and a few of your fellow "Downton Abbey" fans have about $12,300 to spare? If so, you can explore the castle, dine at the mansion and meet the aristocrats who call it home.  As part of the package, the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon will personally greet you when you arrive at the main entrance and invite you to tea and coffee served in the Countess' morning room.  You'll get a private tour of the State Rooms, before sitting down for lunch in the State Dining Room, complete with wines chosen by the earl from his wine cellar.  After the meal, you'll be whisked off to Beacon Hill, which provides sweeping views of the property.  End your day with high tea back at the castle. Up to four people can take part in the pricey tour.  Worthy wasn't aware of any takers yet, but said it's hard to resist the castle's allure.  "It's an escape from your humdrum life, really," Worthy said, noting that the grand manor lifestyle is attracting interest from lots of British travelers exploring their own history, as well as international visitors.  "It's another world. They want to leave their small house and go and see something wonderful, and they want to see lovely gardens and estates. They want to almost be part of it, although it doesn't belong to them."  Where else to explore  Beyond Highclere Castle, some tourists also head to the village of Bampton in Oxfordshire, where many of the exterior town scenes in the series are filmed.  A stop there is often standard in some of the "Downton Abbey" themed tours that have popped up in response to fan demand, such as the ones offered by Brit Movie Tours and Great British Tours.  Pearson recommended that fans inspired to check out other spectacular sites used in popular British films and TV showsincluding "Young Victoria" and "Pride and Prejudice"should visit the National Trust website for a map of filming locations in England.  Such "set-jetting" trips have become one of the most popular travel trends for American tourists in Britain, she said.  A trend only getting hotter, thanks to "Downton Abbey."

Hong Kong In a modern twist of public square shaming, a Chinese court has blazoned the names and offenses of 50 individuals and four companies that have dodged paying fines.  Their photos and personal details have been splashed across a giant electronic screen outside a major train station in Changsha city in China's southern province, Hunan.  Curious onlookers and commuters gathered outside the bustling train station as a series of individual headshots, identity numbers, their offenses and amounts of outstanding court fines rolled across a massive electronic billboard, one after the other, as shown on Chinese state television.  Instead of flashing ads, it serves as a public "wall of shame" for those that failed to pay court-ordered fines for violating property disclosure laws, disobeying court orders or failing to respond to subpoenas.  The amount of outstanding fines range from 10,000 yuan ($1,600) up to 29 million yuan ($4.5 million).  Wang Lifu, a court official, told Hunan city's largest newspaper, Xiaoxiang Morning Post on Wednesday, that it was part of a campaign in the new year to beef up policy implementation measures.  Wang added that it was doing a "public service" by exposing the details.  According to Chinese Supreme Court regulations, it is legal for local courts to publish private information of people or organizations who have disobeyed court orders.  The advertising agency that manages the billboard confirmed with CNN that the court has authorized them to publish personal details of the individuals and companies for two weeks until they pay off their debts.  "As of today, we have taken down information of one company and two individuals because they have settled their debts with the courts," said Chen Kai, general manager of Changsha Gaoxun Advertising Company.  He added that they did not charge the courts for any advertising fees in support of the court's decision to force debtors to pay.  For now, the public also seems to support the court's pressurizing tactics.  "Now those people who are dishonest have nowhere to hide, and dare not do it again," Zhou Ya, a man standing outside the railway station told Hunan TV, a local channel.  "The court has played hardball by exposing these cheaters, well done!" one passerby told local media.  CNN's intern William Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.  
 Pat Nixon had taken Mamie Eisenhower out to lunch. This was in the summer of 1973; the wife of one president and the widow of another talked quietly in the dining room of the United States Senate.  I had traveled to Washington to cover the Senate Watergate hearings, which of course centered on the first lady's husband, and I had unexpectedly been invited to lunch by the other person at my table, which was just a few feet from where Mrs. Nixon and Mrs. Eisenhower were eating.  "What did you think?" George McGovern asked me. He drank a cup of coffee and waited for his omelet to arrive. "When you were riding the planes and looking at the crowds every day, did you think we'd lost it?"  George McGovern, an unabashed liberal voice, dies  Only one year before, he had been traveling the country campaigning nonstop, the Democratic candidate for president. He had hoped to be living in the White House. Now, in that summer of '73, having suffered a landslide defeat at the hands of Richard Nixon, he was a U.S. senator who had just come out of a routine and dreary agriculture subcommittee meeting which had lasted all morning and would resume after the lunch break.  "Did you think we never had a chance from the convention on?" McGovern asked.  The Nixon-McGovern campaign had been my first. McGovern had done his best to get to know the people assigned to cover him, even the neophytes, so I had been pleased that a year after his defeat he would take the time to get a bite to eat with me.  He died on Sunday at age 90 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the same town where he had made his concession speech to Nixon on a cold November night 40 years ago. In the sometimes unforgiving world of political acrimonyleft vs. right, conservative vs.liberalit is easy to reduce national candidates to cartoon figures. But whatever anyone may have thought of McGovern's ideology, he was an awfully good guy. And for those who casually categorized him as "soft," as his political opponents sometimes did, I always offer the suggestion: Unless you flew 35 World War II combat missions over Nazi-occupied Europe as the pilot of a B-24 bomber, as he did, and were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for your valor, as he was, maybe you ought to hold up a little bit before you offhandedly call a man like McGovern soft.  "Because it was the crowds that convinced me that the polls were wrong," McGovern was saying at lunch. "I simply couldn't conceive that the crowds could be so big and enthusiastic, and that the polls could be so drastically negative at the same time. That's the one thing that still puzzles me a little."  Opinion: McGovern ahead of his time  The setting for this conversation bordered on the surreal. McGovern had spent that whole doomed campaign trying in vain to convince the country that he, not Nixon, should be president. Now, in the Senate Dining Room, not only were Mrs. Nixon and Mrs. Eisenhower sitting across the way, but also at nearby tables having lunch were three men who were gaining enormous celebrity as members of the Watergate committee, which was in the midst of holding its nationally televised hearings in the Senate Caucus Room: Sam Ervin of North Carolina, Howard Baker of Tennessee and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut. The country's eyes were riveted on them every day, on every broadcast network.  "No, I really haven't watched the Watergate hearings too much," McGovern said. "Oh, once in a while when I go into the Senate cloakroom the TV set in there is turned on, and I watch it for a few minutes. But I don't watch the reruns at night. It's kind of hard for me to watch the hearings anyway; I guess I feel a little more personally involved in what they're about than most people do."  The night before, he told me, he had been invited to a party at which President Nixon had also been a guest. It was the first time he had encountered Nixon in person since the election. In the receiving line, when the two had come face to face, both men smiled broadly, if uneasily, and news photographers snapped pictures of the moment.  "As soon as I was invited to that party," McGovern said, "I knew the situation was going to come up. ... I didn't think that was the picture they'd take. There was another time when Nixon and (then-National Security Adviser Henry) Kissinger and I were all going to be standing together, and I figured that was the picture they'd take. ... What did people expect me to do when I got to Nixon? Do this?"  Politicians pay tribute  McGovern scowled comically and began waving his finger in the air, as if scolding Nixon.  "Couldn't very well do that," he said, laughing.  The news stories about McGovern's passing said that death came to him at the Dougherty Hospice House in Sioux Falls. When I saw that, I had a feeling. I looked it up.  A man named Bill Dougherty was one of McGovern's dear South Dakota friends. He had risen to the position of lieutenant governor of the state; he was with McGovern to offer consolation on that night in Sioux Falls when the election results came in.  Dougherty died in 2010; the hospice facility was named in his honor.  So McGovern spent the last days of his life back in South Dakota, within the welcoming walls of a building bearing the name of his old friend. Home, and friendship: sustaining and real in a way that vote totals and lofty titles can never compete with. If you're lucky, that is. George McGovern was.  Highlights of McGovern's life  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.

Lionel Messi produced a performance of stunning brilliance, scoring all four goals as holders Barcelona beat Arsenal 4-1 to reach the semifinals of the Champions League 6-3 on aggregate on Tuesday.  Messi turned on the style in the Nou Camp with one of the most devastating individual displays the competition has ever seen, as an injury-ravaged Arsenal side were torn apart.  The match started started brightly for the Londoners who actually took a shock 18th-minute lead.  Theo Walcott's pace had troubled Barca in the 2-2 first leg at The Emirates and the England winger created the opener with a break down the right.  His pass inside for Nicklas Bendtner was a poor one, but somehow the Dane managed to pounce at the second attempt to stab his shot past Victor Valdes in the Barca goal.  Arsenal's lead lasted barely three minutes before Messi began his one-man show. Mickael Silvestre failed to clear the ball on the edge of the area and it fell to Messi, who curled home a superb equalizer.  Messi added his and Barca's second on 37 minutes. Eric Abidal's cross from the right was cut out by Thomas Vermaelen.  However, the rest of the Arsenal defense were slow to react and Pedro found Messi, who smashed his shot past Manuel Almunia.  The striker completed his stunning hat-trick four minutes before the break when he raced onto a header from Abidal to sprint clear of the Arsenal defense before superbly chipping the ball over Almunia.  By now, Arsenal needed two goals to go through and, in truth, they never looked likely to get them.  Bendtner struck the post with a fierce header from Gael Clichy's cross, but he was flagged offside, and Tomas Rosicky fired over the bar when in a great position.  Messi completed the job three minutes from time, beating two defender on the left hand side of the area before firing the ball through Almunia's legs.  The result means Barcelona will now face Italian champions Inter Milan, who they were drawn against in the group stages, in a mouth-watering semifinal clash.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was full of praise for Messi's performance. "For me, he is the best player in the world, and by a distance," he told Sky Sports.  "When he's in the game, he's really dangerous. Once he is on the run with the ball, he is unstoppable.  The Frenchman added: "I believe that we lost against a team that is better than us and have the best player in the world."  
 Bangkok, Thailand In a birthday speech Thursday, Thailand's deeply revered king asked the nation to maintain the peace it has enjoyed "for a very long time" by working hand in hand.  "Our nation has always been in peace for very long time because there is unity in our nation," King Bhumibol Adulyadej said. "Each of us performs our duties in a harmonious manner for the sake of our country.  "Every Thai should realize this, and perform their given duties to benefit the broader public."  Tensions ease in Thailand as police remove barriers  The ceremony was attended by embattled Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.  The Thai capital, Bangkok, has seen several days of protests to force Yingluck Shinawatra from office. Those demonstrations took a break this week after the Thai government said it had negotiated a temporary truce with protesters to celebrate the king's birthday.  The world's longest-serving monarch, the king turned 86 on Thursday.  Thai king leaves hospital after four years  Suthep Thaugsuban, who has led the demonstrations against Yingluck's government in pockets of central Bangkok, said the campaign will resume.  "We will continue fighting until Thaksin's regime is definitively wiped out," he said, referring to Thaksin Shinawatra, the exiled former Prime Minister and brother of Yingluck who is considered to retain considerable influence in Thailand.

Hatay, Turkey Clashes erupted across Turkey on Tuesday after a predawn skirmish between police and protesters left one demonstrator dead in the border province of Hatay.  Crowds of demonstrators gathered in the cities of Istanbul, Ankara and Hatay to denounce the death of Ahmet Atakan, a 22-year-old who recently graduated from accounting school.  Police in Istanbul dispersed demonstrators using water cannons, tear gas and rubber pellets. Thousands of demonstrators tried to reach Taksim Square, a main commercial area that has been the site of clashes since May. Riot police prevented small groups from congregating in the square.  Demonstrators erected barricades, threw stones and shot firecrackers at the police. Crowds of protestors chanted "Down with the government" and "Solidarity with Armutlu" referring to the neighborhood in Hatay where Atakan was fatally injured.  According to the official government broadcaster, TRT, the tear gas around the Taksim area blew into a nearby football stadium where the youth Swedish national soccer team was squaring off against Turkey's national squad.  The Spanish referee suspended the game after the tear gas wafted into the stadium, which is named after Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  Several days ago, Istanbul lost a hotly contested bid to host the 2020 Olympics to rival Tokyo.  Many analysts said the widely criticized use of police force to crush anti-government protests last June may have played in a role in Istanbul's Olympic defeat.  Differing accounts of how protester died  There is still controversy over how Atakan, the protester in Hatay, died.  In a press release, the Hatay governor's office said Atakan was killed in a fall during a clash between police and demonstrators.  Shortly before 1 a.m. on Tuesday, a patrol unit reported that one person "had fallen to the street from a building" and an ambulance was sent, the governor's office said.  "However, people at the scene wanted to take the injured individual to the hospital with their own resources, and our citizen Ahmet Atakan was taken to the Antakya Government Hospital, but he lost his life in spite of all efforts at the hospital."  Police released a video taken from atop an armored vehicle that showed the blurry image of a man apparently falling off a street curb into the street.  But eyewitnesses insisted Atakan was struck in the head at short range by a tear gas canister fired from the turret of an armored vehicle.  Eylem Mansuroglu said that immediately after being hit by the canister, Atakan was grazed by a passing police vehicle. Atakan's blood still stained the pavement where residents erected a makeshift memorial for the dead man.  Hasan Akgol, a parliament member from Turkey's opposition CHP party, told CNN he had seen Atakan's body on a stretcher.  "I couldn't believe it, seeing a young kid covered in blood," Akgol said. "He had an injury behind his ear, blood all over his body, scratches on his body."  Atakan is the second anti-government protester to die in Hatay this summer.  Neighborhood rises up in protest  Atakan's parents told CNN their son had gone out to the streets after attending a wedding Monday night, to attend a protest sit-in.  They said it was a weekly protest in honor of Abdullah Comert, another young man from the same neighborhood who was killed in a clash with police last June, barely 3 blocks from where Atakan was fatally injured. The protest was also against the Turkish government and its strong support for Syrian rebels and a proposed U.S.-led military operation in Syria.  Bergen: Syria plunging Mideast into sectarian war?  "My son protested against war so that there would be peace. In Turkey they kill those who want peace," screamed Atakan's weeping mother, Emsal, before her son's burial on Tuesday.  "Erdogan's dogs killed my son," she wailed.  In the afternoon on Tuesday, a procession of more than a thousand people escorted Atakan's coffin to a cemetery, chanting, "We are all Ahmet. You can kill one but not all," and "Murderer police will answer for their actions."  After the burial, crowds marched to the street where Atakan was injured.  Police used water cannons and fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.  Protestors set up burning barricades and threw stones at armored police vehicles.  Much of the neighborhood of Armutlu appeared to be rising up in protest.  Women screamed out of their balconies, demanding police stay out of the area. From an apartment building, one resident hurled a potted plant off a balcony at an armored vehicle passing on the street below. A portly woman threw a plate down on to the street. One man carried a toilet out into the road and smashed it onto the ground to build a barricade out of the debris.  Aid worker: Syrian refugee crisis creating long-term burden for neighbors  
 Los Cabos, Mexico The United States on Tuesday supported European leaders' efforts to ease the debt crisis, including the formation of a "banking union" to safeguard their financial systems.  "If people have a sense of where they are going, that can provide confidence and break the fever," President Barack Obama said at the end of the two-day G-20 summit.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said European leaders, meeting again next week, want to design a long-term framework for stability and take swift steps to institute short-term reforms.  "What this means is a framework of reforms so they can stand behind their banks, provide capital to the banks that need it, make sure they're protecting the safety of their depositors," Geithner said.  Leaders will work to ensure Italy and Spain can borrow at sustainable interest rates, said Geithner, indicating the United States was "encouraged" by developments and the meeting's focus on economic growth.  G20 pledges to support world economy  The European Union earlier this month unveiled a plan to create a coordinated banking union rather than leaving troubled nations to deal with their own banking crisis.  The proposal would include a single deposit guarantee organization covering all banks in the union, something similar to the FDIC, which covers U.S. bank deposits.  The summit largely focused on boosting a sluggish global recovery threatened by a possible collapse of the euro currency union.  European leaders are moving with a "heightened sense of urgency" to address the continent's financial problems, according to Obama. "They understand the stakes and pledge to take the action needed to address this crisis."  The president acknowledged "slower growth in Europe means slower growth in American jobs" and the potential effects on the upcoming election.  "If we do the right thing, politics will follow," Obama said.  Host President Felipe Calderon of Mexico, speaking at the end of the summit, said leaders agreed to extend a commitment to not introduce protectionist measures until 2014.  He also told reporters that Spain had not formally asked for a bailout.  In a declaration, G-20 leaders said they "would act together to strengthen recovery and address financial market tensions."  "Euro Area members of the G-20 will take all necessary policy measures to safeguard the integrity and stability of the area, improve the functioning of financial markets and break the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks," they said.  The International Monetary Fund said a number of member countries made emergency fund pledges, helping "efforts to create a $456 billion global firewall that puts the IMF in a much better position to help its 188 member countries restore sounder economic and financial conditions worldwide. "  "These resources are being made available for crisis prevention and resolution and to meet the potential financing needs of all IMF members," said Christine Legarde, managing director.  The summit largely focused on one of the primary causes of the global economy's lethargic recoverythe threat of a European currency collapse that would roil the already fragile economies of most of the 17 countries that use the euro.  Obama played a role in ensuring other G-20 nations heard about European strategies, according to a senior administration official.  "The framework they (Europeans) are building, as they described it to us, amounts to a more forceful response than they've contemplated to date," the official said.  A main topic of the summit was Sunday's elections in debt-ridden Greece, where the center-right New Democracy party received the most votes and was asked to try to form a coalition government.  "They all want to work in partnership with Greece to make sure that Greece is reforming within the EU," Geithner said of European leaders.  The members of the G-20 are the United States, the European Union, Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Russia, China, Canada, Argentina, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Australia.

Kimchi-making season is upon South Korea, with grocery stores besieged with housewives snapping up buckets of giant cabbages, salt and red pepper powderor more often these days buying pre-made kimchi so they don't have to go to the trouble.  In one of Seoul's more unusual sights, 3,000 housewives marked the start of the period in which the ingredients are at their freshest, with the country's biggest kimchi-making event to date in front of Seoul's City Plaza on Wednesday.  Armed with aprons, rubber gloves and sanitary shower caps, the women stuffed and spiced a whopping 61,700 cabbages to provide 25,000 families with their essential side dishthat's 250 tons of fermented spicy cabbage.  The mayor of Seoul presided over the festival, which was a charity event started by a Busan Yakult saleswoman in 2001 to provide kimchi to poorer households, and evolved into an annual national event in 2008, according to Korean daily Joongang Ilbo.  The numbers are so large, organizers announced they're approaching Guinness to establish a new World Record category.

 BAGHDAD, Iraq  A 12-year-old girl died Monday after she was struck by a warning shot fired as a vehicle accelerated toward an Iraqi police station, said the U.S.-led military coalition.  The incident occurred in Hurriya in Nineveh province, according to a news release from Multi-National Corp-Iraq. A vehicle accelerated as it approached the Hurriya police station, where coalition forces and Iraqi police were conducting security operations, it said.  "The coalition forces and Iraqi police waved and yelled for the vehicle to stop," the news release said. "After the vehicle failed to stop, coalition forces fired two warning rounds."  The girl, who was standing about 100 meters (about 328 feet) behind the vehicle, was hit by one of the rounds, the release said. Troops attempted to treat her at the scene, but she died while being transported to a hospital.  The incident was under investigation, the release said, adding that Col. Gary Volesky, commander of U.S. forces in Nineveh province, "expresses his condolences to the girl's family for the unfortunate accident."  The news release did not say what happened to the vehicle.

Marriage, any good therapist will tell you, is a balancing act.  For Angela and Willie Gillis, the act is easy. They've been best friends for more than 10 years, married for three. Their individual strengths balance the other's weaknesses.  They credit this sense of balance with helping them lose a combined 500 pounds.  "Everyone needs that one person to help them through, to talk to and someone who will hold them accountable. That person has been my husband," Angela writes on her blog, WeBeatFat.com.  A few days before their first wedding anniversary, Willie woke up and told his wife, "I'm tired of being big." He had just gotten back from visiting his newborn goddaughter and was scared he might not live long enough to see her grow up.  "For years I had been reading up on 'This is how you lose weightnutrition, exercise,'" he says. "I wanted to see if I could do it."  That was January 2011. He weighed 492 pounds.  Couple's 500-pound weight loss just one success story  His wife didn't have to think long about joining him in his quest.  Growing up, she never thought she had a problem. "You know how (New Jersey) Gov. (Chris) Christie said, 'I'm the healthiest fat person'? That's how I was," she remembers.  She was fairly active, but she loved food. If she was happy, she ate. If she was sad, she ate. If she had the best day of her life, she ate chili cheese tater tots.  By January 2011, she weighed 338 pounds.  Willie had recently moved to Angela's hometown of Beaumont, Texasa city so enamored with fried food and lazy summer days that it was named the fifth most obese city in the nation in 2012.  Even in the growing population, the two felt ostracized by their size.  "It's amazing how people will look at you when you're fat," she says. "We just didn't want to be those people anymore."  Memphis, most obese U.S. city, moving from fit to fat  So, her husband took out his research and created a plan. The couple started hitting the gym six days a week. At first, all they could do was walk 30 minutes on the treadmill. Slowly they increased their time, until she was running and he had walked off almost 150 pounds.  In the kitchen, Angela was the expert. She loves to cook and quickly learned to make healthier versions of the couple's favorite meals. The Gillises started eating a solid breakfast of steel cut oats and fruit or veggie omelets. They packed diet-friendly frozen meals for lunch and low-calorie snacks like yogurt, carrots and apples. Dinner wasand still islean meats and vegetables.  "We haven't had fried food in two years," she says.  That doesn't mean they don't give in to cravings on occasion. Willie used an iPhone app to track his calories and saved a few every day for a weekend treat. Angela had to continually ask herself if she was eating something because she loved it or because she just loved eating. Through it all, they kept each other accountable.  "I never wanted to come home and say, 'This is what I did today,' because I didn't want to disappoint him," she says. "And he didn't want to disappoint me."  Eating out was their biggest obstacle. Even light restaurant meals can be loaded with sodium and fat. It didn't bother the Gillises to go out and not eat anything, but it bothered the people they were with.  "Most of the memories we had with our friends (were) sitting down, going out to eat," she remembers. "Food is a very social thing."  They ended up isolating themselves a bit, and met new friends through their gym. They took photos of their progress, seeing a visible change each month as they weighed in.  Life for the Gillises is now full of activity. She teaches spin classes at the gym and recently completed a half marathon. She's lost 200 pounds, going from a size 28 to a size 0.  "I'm stronger. I believe more. I go after things I want more. I was never, ever a risk taker, but now I take the risk," she says.  Willie joined a local running club. He has lost 300 pounds and gained a world of self-confidence.  "A lot of people give upthey end up quitting because they're not doing something right. You have to take what you messed up on and try to make it work for you," he says. "Once you learn it, it doesn't take much to keep it going."  
 Washington A week after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of an Ohio law that restricts early voting, Attorney General Eric Holder argued the decision will disproportionately affect African-Americans, many of whom "heavily" use early voting.  "It is a major step backward to allow these reductions to early voting to go into effect," Holder said in a video message posted Monday.  "Early voting is about much more than making it more convenient for people to exercise their civic responsibilities. It's about preserving access and openness for every eligible voter, not just those who can afford to miss work or who can afford to pay for childcare," he continued in the video, which was posted on the Justice Department's website.  The law cut down the state's 35-day early voting window by seven days.  Proponents say that reducing in-person early voting would help create uniformity across the state's counties, and voters would still be able to vote by mail during that seven-day window.  But critics argue the Republican-backed law will make it more difficult for minorities to vote.  Opinion: Why does GOP fight early voting?  While the Justice Department was not a part of the lawsuit, it filed a brief in the case in July.  A federal judge had previously said the law was unconstitutional and placed a hold on it so it couldn't go into effect. That decision was upheld by a federal appeals court judge. But the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision allowed for the law to go into effect immediately. Early voting in Ohio now official starts this week.  In his video message, Holder said early voting is "heavily used" by African-Americans because the practice is popular among people who have a hard time getting to the polls due to childcare responsibilities, hourly salaries, and reduced access to transportation.  "Restricting voting hours in ways that would disproportionately impact minority communities is not only unnecessary and unwarrantedit is out of step with our history of continually expanding the franchise," he said. "It is contrary to our fundamental values of equality, opportunity, and inclusion. And it is an affront to millions who have marched, and fought, and too often died to make real America's most basic promise."  Holder announced late last month he'll soon be resigning from his post, but will stay on until a replacement has been confirmed.

You don't have to be an expert to ask yourself the question: How in the world, with today's technology, can a commercial airplane go missing?  It's a question, but also an expression of disbelief.  Those who get lost driving can use GPS. If you lose your iPhone, there's an app to track it down. Scientists successfully plotted the course for a spacecraft that landed on a speeding comet.  But something goes wrong aboard a 123-foot, 67-ton passenger jet, and rescuers must resort to scouring the ocean?  "Why is it easier to find an iPhone (than) to find a plane?" one Twitter user, Catalina Buitano, asked.  There are dozens of similar questions on social media. They hint at the same sentiment: In a world where people's locations are tracked for everything from map apps to what ads appear on a Web browser, why does Big Brother's gaze avoid the skies?  "Why, in this day and age, do we rely on the physical recovery of black boxes? Flight data should be continuously streamed to the cloud," read a tweet by Jacob Rossi.  Of course, this question has been asked before.  The disappearance of AirAsia Flight 8501 on Sunday was the second time this year that a plane vanished. Debris from the Airbus A320-200 has been found, the airline said Tuesday, and two bodies have been found.  Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished, too, and remains missing 10 months later.  At that time, Jim Hall, the former head of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, called for upgrades to the tracking capabilities of planes that fly for extended periods over water.  The airline industry has invested billions of dollars in safety features, "yet many allow their aircraft to fall off any direct tracking capability as they fly over vast ocean distances and remote locations, confident that these planes will occasionally check in and reappear as they near the other side of the blacked-out area," Hall wrote.  In a preliminary report on MH370, Malaysian aviation authorities recommended that the International Civil Aviation Organization look into the benefits of introducing a standard for real-time tracking of commercial aircraft.  The technology exists to track flight data in real time, but even after tragedies such as MH370, cost and government bureaucracy are cited as obstacles to implementation.  "Millions of us can be located immediately through technology in our handheld cell phones, but a 300,000-pound Boeing 777 with 239 souls on board disappears from the face of the Earth," Hall wrote, referring to MH370. "NASA has the capability of photographing stars billions of light-years away, and yet our best minds are forced to guess where this plane might be."  Another Twitter user phrased the thought this way: "If we have astronauts reaching safely the International Space Station, why do we still have missing planes on Earth?"  CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo says it is time for world leaders to take concrete action on upgrading technology for tracking planes. Making recommendations isn't enough, she said. There need to be laws.  "I think at this day and age, there's really no excuse for (not having real-time tracking)," Schiavo said on CNN's "New Day" on Monday. "I mean, the kind of technology, it's already here. We don't have to wait to develop it. Those planes could be sending out continuous signals."  Two companies with products on the market for real-time streaming are Flyht and Star Navigation Systems.  But the technology is not catching on with major carriers.  Cost has been the biggest hurdle, though the technology is slowly finding its way onto airplanes, said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly.  Airlines have lobbied for governments to contribute money to equipping planes with new technology, arguing that it is not just an airline issue, but a national security consideration.  The question of who will pay for the technology is beginning to get answered, but not as quickly as travelers would like to see, Kaplan said.  So, those in disbelief are not alone in wondering how in today's world a plane could simply get lost. It's just not an easy question to answer.  
 A former soldier arrested after a hostage incident at a military base in Georgia faces multiple charges that include threatening to kill President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, according to federal court documents filed Tuesday.  Robert Anthony Quinones, 29, of Hinesville, Georgia, was arrested Monday after the two-hour hostage situation at Winn Community Hospital on Fort Stewart, about 45 miles from Savannah, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Officials and a family member said he had demanded mental health care at the hospital.  Quinones is charged with assault of a federal officer and kidnapping in the incident, which ended with the gunman's surrender and no injuries.  After he was taken into custody and during interviews, Quinones "expressed his plans, preparation and intentions to kill President Obama and former President Clinton," according to an affidavit filed in federal cour. "Quinones detailed his studies of Secret Service protocols, sniper techniques and means of disguise and weapons concealment to implement his assassination plans."  A search of his residence resulted in the discovery of 11 long guns, four pistols, multiple rounds of ammunition and dozens of bayonets and knives, according to the affidavit.  Authorities also found books and manuals about FBI hostage rescue teams, Osama bin Laden, Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, the Russian Mafia and other topics, according to the affidavit signed by FBI and Secret Service agents.  Quinones, when asked if he would kill Obama or Clinton if given a chance, said, "Yes. On a scale of 1 to 10 about being serious, I am a 10," the affidavit said.  Quinones was discharged from the military in February and had a civilian job at Fort Stewart, said the FBI, which released no other information on his military record.  Quinones' mother, Janet Gladwell, told the Associated Press he was medically discharged from the Army months ago because he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.  A neighbor, Jerry Franklin, said he had known Quinones for several years. "He was a good kid," he said.  Franklin, 48, an Army retiree, said Quinones would talk with he and other veterans because they understood the stress brought on by combat. Quinones had served two tours in Iraq, said Franklin.  "All I know is he saw death," Franklin told CNN.  "Maybe they [the Army] should have helped him a little more," said Franklin, adding he was not blaming the military for the incident. Quinones might not have received sufficient individual treatment after returning from Iraq, Franklin said.  Quinones worked at one of Fort Stewart's post-exchange stores. the neighbor said, adding he didn't believe Quinones had been treated at Winn Army Community Hospital, scene of Monday's hostage situation.  The hostage incident started at about 4 a.m. Monday when the former Army serviceman entered the facility and demanded care, spokesman Kevin Larson said Monday.  Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Phillips, a senior Fort Stewart commander, told the Associated Press the former soldier told hostages he needed help for mental problems "connected, I'm quite certain, to his past service."  The gunman immediately took one hostage and went to the third floor, which houses the behavioral health unit, where he held two more people at gunpoint, including a nurse practitioner, Larson said. The nurse, an Army major, was able to calm the man and authorities started negotiations, Larson said. The gunman  eventually surrendered and was taken into custody for questioning, he said.  Quinones was armed with an MP5 assault rifle, an AR-15 assault rifle, a 9 millimeter handgun and a .38-caliber pistol, according to the affidavit. It accuses the gunman of pointing a firearm at an Army negotiator.  Quinones' attorney, Karl Christian Zipperer, said late Tuesday afternoon he had just gotten the case and would have no comment.  A phone number for Quinones in Hinesville was disconnected.  The suspect's initial appearance is scheduled for Wednesday before a U.S. magistrate judge in Savannah, the FBI said in a statement.  CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.

The family of an American citizen who was detained for several months in North Korea said Saturday it was ecstatic over news of his release and thanked the U.S. and North Korean governments for the roles they played in it.  A U.S. team led by envoy Robert King left North Korea Saturday after winning the release Eddie Yong Su Jun, state media reported.  "Words cannot fully express how overjoyed we are to be reunited with our husband and father," read a statement from the Jun family that was given to CNN. "We are grateful that the DPRK government has granted our plea for his humanitarian release; further, we sincerely thank them for taking care of his health."  Jun, a Korean-American businessman, was detained for "committing a crime" against North Korea after entering the country, KCNA had reported.  Jun admitted his crime during an investigation, the North Korean news agency said, but it did not specify what crime he had allegedly committed.  Jun was arrested in November, KCNA reported.  "We would also like to express our deep gratitude to the U.S. State Department and Congressman Royce and his staff for their unwavering commitment to protect the welfare of US citizens and to see our family reunited," Jun's family said, thanking Rep. Ed Royce, R-California. The family is from the southern part of the state.  Jun's release followed a visit by King, the special envoy for North Korean human rights, and Jon Brause, from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The group went there to assess food shortages that have left thousands starving after floods and harsh weather devastated North Korea's crops.  King and Brause "expressed regret at the incident on behalf of the U.S. government and assured that it would make all its efforts to prevent the recurrence of similar incident," KCNA reported.  The news agency also said former U.S. President Jimmy Carter asked North Korea to pardon Jun.  "Taking all this into account, the ... government decided to set him free from the humanitarian" standpoint, KCNA said.  State Department spokesman Mark Toner cheered news of Jun's release, but stressed decisions about food aid are in no way related to "any policy decision if you will. It's a separate process all together," he said.  The assessment team traveling with King will continue its work on the ground and "when they come back, we will look at their assessments, study it and compare to other assessments by other "nongovernmental organizations and groups that have made similar trips, to make a decision on the amount of aid to extend, Toner said Friday.  While the United States praised the North for its action, the two countries are still a long way from normalizing relations.  Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years due in part to concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear development program.  The United States and South Korea held joint military drills in February, despite North Korea's warning to the South not to carry them outcalling the exercises a provocation.  South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors.  In November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. That same month, it detained Jun.  Two State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details, told CNN in April that Jun was a Korean-American businessman who had a visa to enter North Korea.  The U.S. suspended aid two years ago to North Korea because it suspected the donated food was being diverted to the military or not reaching those most in need.  North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years, increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington.  In 2010, Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen who was fined about $600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea. Gomes, who attempted suicide while in North Korean custody, was thought to be a Christian activist.  Two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, were arrested after entering North Korea in 2009. They were sentenced to 12 years' hard labor before being released in August 2009 after an intervention by former President Bill Clinton.  CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.  
 It's called the Grand Renaissance Damand the clue is in the name.  With some 8,500 laborers working around the clock on its construction, the imposingly-named dam is surely one of Africa's most ambitious infrastructure projects, reaffirming Ethiopia's ambitions of becoming a big regional player and a major exporter of power.  When completed, the project will generate around 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and exports.  The most striking aspect of the nearly $5 billion enterprise is, however, that it is entirely funded by Ethiopia, without any foreign investment. According to the authorities, 20% of the project is financed from bond offerings to Ethiopians, and the remaining 80% from tax collection.  "It was seen as a strategically important initiative that the government and the Ethiopian people are financing it 100%," says Zemedeneh Negatu, managing partner at Ernst & Young Ethiopia.  "They have come up with a very creative and innovative way that I think will be a lesson for other African countries who want to embark on such large infrastructure projects, and want to have the flexibility to do it themselves," he adds.  Hydroelectric powerhouse  So far, Ethiopians at home and abroad have contributed about $350 million, and the government says that the 170 meter tall dam is on track for a 2017 opening, with 40% of the work already complete.  Ethiopia's per capita income might be one of the lowest in the world, but the country has enjoyed an impressive economic growth since 2000, averaging 10.9% annually, which has resulted in a 33% reduction of people living in poverty. If the Grand Renaissance Dam and other hydroelectric projects, such as the Gibe III dam on the Omo river, are completed on time, The World Bank estimates Ethiopia could earn $1 billion a year from electricity exports. Negatu says that this would make the country the largest exporter of power in Africa, and second only to South Africa when it comes to installed capacity.  Unhappy neighbors  Yet, not everyone is happy about Ethiopia's energetic drive to harness its water resources. The Grand Renaissance Dam is being built on Blue Nile, a tributary of the Nile River which has been powering the agriculture of Sudan and Egyptthrough which it flowsfor millennia. These countries have opposed the project in the past, fearing that the dam will reduce their share of the Nile water. The ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi had even threatened to defend "each drop of Nile water with our blood if necessary" back in 2013.  Passions have been calmer more recently, and today the Reuters news agency reported that representatives of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia reached a preliminary agreement  in Khartoum on how to operate the dam. Negatu is convinced that a compromise will be reached, as he thinks that the dam will ultimately benefit not just Ethiopia but most other East African nations.  "This is actually a regional project because up from Egypt all the way down to Rwanda, countries are going to buy the power that's generated by this dam," Negatu says, adding that both Rwanda and Kenya have already agreed to purchase thousands of megawatts once the project is finished.  A lack of reliable power has long stunted Africa's development, with 600 million people on the continent not connected to the grid and getting by on a mix of generators, kerosene lamps and candles. In Ethiopia, only 15 to 20% of the population has access to power according to a study by Chatham House.  "It's Africa's Achilles' heel," says Negatu. "With anyone who wants to build a factory in Africa, the first thing they ask is infrastructure, and within infrastructure, whether there is sufficient electricity. Industrialization has always been about electricity, and this [dam] addresses this basic need."  He adds that, after depending on exporting raw commodities for decades, governments across Africa should be pursuing a strategy of industrialization, following the example of China.  "We've got to move up the value chain, and it's what Ethiopia is doing right now. Its strategy is industrial-basednot to export commodities but to manufacture value-added things, and other African nations are trying to emulate that. But without electricity there won't be industrialization in Africa."

Two more infants have contracted the herpes virus after undergoing an ultra-Orthodox Jewish type of circumcision, which has been linked to the spread of the potentially deadly virus to newborn boys, according to the New York City Health Department.  In the ritual, known as metzitzah b'peh, after removing the foreskin of the penis the person performing the procedure places his mouth briefly over the wound, sucking a small amount of blood out, which is  discarded. Antibacterial ointment is applied and the wound is bandaged. The health department says the procedure is dangerous because the contact with the mouth could transmit diseases such as herpes.  Most adults are infected with the herpes simplex virus type 1, and while they may have no symptoms, the virus may be present in their saliva, according to the health department. (It is different from herpes simplex virus type 2, which is usually transmitted sexually.)  "While HSV-1 in adults can cause the common cold sore, HSV-1 infection in newborns is very serious," a department statement says.  Since 2000, there have been 13 reports in New York City of infants contracting HSV-1, two of whom died from the virus. The health department reported that an estimated 20,493 infants in New York City were exposed to the practice in that period.  In the most recent case, the infant developed a fever seven days after circumcision and vesicular lesions the following day, according to a press release from the city health department. Seventy percent of neonatal herpes cases show lesions and only 40% produce a fever.  The DOH passed a regulation in September requiring all those who perform the ritual to get parental consent on a form stating that the procedure can lead to health risks. Several Jewish groups and three rabbis filed a lawsuit in federal District Court in Manhattan arguing that "the government cannot compel the transmission of messages that the speaker does not want to expressespecially when the speaker is operating in an area of heightened First Amendment protection, such as a religious ritual."  Dr. Thomas A. Farley, commissioner of the city's health department, claimed the consent requirement was "lawful, appropriate and necessary" in a September press release. "The city's highest obligation is to protect its children; therefore, it is important that parents know the risks associated with the practice," he said.  Baby boys whose circumcisions likely involved the ritual between April 2006 and December 2011 had an estimated risk of contracting neonatal HSV-1 infection of 24.4 per 100,000 cases, 3.4 times greater than other infants, according to the health department.  "There is no safe way to perform oral suction on any open wound in a newborn," Farley said.  While Jews regularly practice circumcision as part of their religion, metzitzah b'peh is limited to a relatively small number of ultra-Orthodox Jews.  
 BAGHDAD, Iraq Iraq's most powerful Sunni Arab political party on Monday said a U.S. soldier's desecration of the Quran, the Muslim holy book, requires the "severest of punishments," not just an apology and a military reassignment.  Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond apologizes after a U.S. soldier admitted using the Quran for target practice.  The Iraqi Islamic Party, the movement of Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, condemned what it said was a "blatant assault on the sanctities of Muslims all over the world."  An American staff sergeant who was a sniper section leader used a Quran for target practice on May 9.  The U.S. commander in Baghdad on Saturday issued a formal apology and read a letter of apology from the shooter.  The sergeant has been relieved of duty as a section leader "with prejudice," officially reprimanded by his commanding general, dismissed from his regiment and redeployedreassigned to the United States.  But the Iraqi Islamic Partywhich said it reacted to the news "with deep resentment and indignation"wants the "severest of punishments" for the action.  "What truly concerns us is the repetition of these crimes that have happened in the past when mosques were destroyed and pages of the Holy Quran were torn and used for disgraceful acts by U.S. soldiers," al-Hashimi said.  "I have asked that first this apology be officially documented; second a guarantee from the U.S. military to inflict the maximum possible punishment on this soldier so it would be a deterrent for the rest of the soldiers in the future."  A tribal leader said "the criminal act by U.S. forces" took place at a shooting range at the Radhwaniya police station on Baghdad's western outskirts. After the shooters left, an Iraqi policeman found a target marked in the middle of the bullet-riddled Quran.  Read how the soldier could have provoked a crisis  Copies of the pictures of the Quran obtained by CNN show multiple bullet holes and an expletive scrawled on one of its pages.  On Saturday, Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond, commander of U.S. forces in Baghdad, appeared at an apology ceremony flanked by leaders from Radhwaniya.  Watch as the U.S. formally apologizes   "I come before you here seeking your forgiveness," Hammond said to tribal leaders and others gathered. "In the most humble manner, I look in your eyes today, and I say please forgive me and my soldiers."  Another military official kissed a Quran and presented it as "a humble gift" to the tribal leaders.  Hammond also read from the shooter's letter: "I sincerely hope that my actions have not diminished the partnership that our two nations have developed together. ... My actions were shortsighted, very reckless and irresponsible, but in my heart [the actions] were not malicious."  Hammond said, "The actions of one soldier were nothing more than criminal behavior. I've come to this land to protect you, to support younot to harm youand the behavior of this soldier was nothing short of wrong and unacceptable."  The soldier reportedly claimed he wasn't aware the book was the Quran, but U.S. officials rejected his assertion.  Tribal leaders, dignitaries and local security officials attended the ceremony, while residents carried banners and chanted slogans, including, "Yes, yes to the Quran" and "America out, out."  Watch as villagers protest the Quran incident   Sheikh Hamadi al-Qirtani, in a speech on behalf of all tribal sheikhs of Radhwaniya, called the shooting "aggression against the entire Islamic world."  The Association of Muslim Scholars in Iraq also condemned the shooter's actions and the U.S. military's belated acknowledgment of what happened.  "As the Association of Muslim Scholars condemns this heinous crime against God's holy book, the constitution of this nation, a source of pride and dignity," the group's statement said, "they condemned the silence by all those who are part of the occupation's agenda and holds the occupation and the current government fully responsible for this violation and reminds everyone that God preserves his book and he [God] is a great avenger."

In the face of several tough upcoming Senate races, many Democratic candidates have found a multitude of ways to separate themselves from the President's most recent speech on ISIS.  Alaska Sen. Mark Begich said he opposes arming Syrian rebels. "We must have greater assurance that we aren't arming extremists who will eventually use the weapons against us," he said.  Begich has been working to distance himself from the President on a multitude of issues in a tight Senate race.  5 takeaways from Obama's speech  After the speech, Colorado Sen. Mark Udall challenged the President's suggestion that he has unilateral authority to expand military operations. He said Obama must receive authorization from Congress to do some of the things outlined in the speech. "I will not give this presidentor any other presidenta blank check to begin another land war in Iraq," Udall said in a statement.  Udall's demand that Congress go on the record is contrary to conventional wisdom that campaigning lawmakers don't want to go on record before a war-weary electorate weeks before an election. But he's running against a member of Congress, Rep. Cory Gardner, so if Udall has to take a vote, Gardner does tooand both will be held accountable.  After the President spoke, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire attempted to look tough against the President of the same party. "I will continue to press the President to use all of the tools at his disposal, short of ground troops, to defeat ISIS," she said.  Shaheen's challenger, Scott Brown, has been making ISIS and terrorism an issue on the campaign trail in the tightening race.  Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina took an approach similar to Shaheen's. "I pressed the administration to arm and empower moderate Syrian rebels and I am glad that effort will be accelerated."  Hagan presented an image of someone who was standing up to the President, responding to attacks made by her challenger in an upcoming Senate race, Thom Tillis, who has argued that Hagan is a puppet of Obama.  Tillis said after Obama's speech: "The job of a senator is to stand up to the President when they are wrong, something Sen. Hagan has repeatedly refused to do."  Showdown: Jay Carney, John McCain face off  
 Washington The dinner was billed as a "Celebration of Service." The honorees: Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The hosts: the Federalist Society, an influential conservative legal group whose membership includes judges, lawmakers and government officials.  Little news was made at the society's recent three-day convention, but the appearance of perhaps the Supreme Court's most right-leaning members was buzzworthy and just the latest chapter in what can be read as both drama and farce: the future of health care reform in the U.S. and the sideline war over who will be on hand to decide it.  The high-stakes legal fight will be argued by the nine-member bench in March, with a ruling expected by June. And if advocates on both sides of the debate have their way, perhaps only seven, even six justices could decide what shapes up to be the biggest constitutional fight in a decade.  The timing of Scalia's and Thomas' appearance especially outrages liberals, coming as it did just hours after the court privately agreed to accept the health care cases for review. There have been calls for Scalia and especially Thomas to recuse themselves or pull out of hearing the issue.  And from the right: similar demands of Justice Elena Kagan. As a top member of President Obama's Justice Department last year, conservatives allege, she may have been more involved than once believed in preparing legal strategy for the health care appeals just before she was chosen for the high court.  None of the justices appear ready to step aside, something many legal analysts say is both proper and expected.  "We have attacks on both justices on the right, like Justice Thomas, and on the left, Elena Kagan, trying to influence the outcome of cases by getting them to recuse," said Thomas Goldstein, a Washington lawyer and founder of Scotusblog.com. "Particularly, we see this in the health care litigation that's coming to the Supreme Court. All of those efforts are doomed. The justices realize that they need to participate in the case, it's their constitutional duty, and I think this is just political posturing, on both sides, by activists."  Losing just one justice could make a difference  A loss of just one justice from ruling on an issue like health care would be huge, making a difference perhaps in the ultimate outcome. No wonder activists have launched a political and legal war to try to manipulate the judicial playing field to each side's advantage.  And why should outside groups have all the fun? To no one's surprise, members of Congress also demand a piece of the action.  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, demanded last week that the attorney general be more forthcoming about Kagan's involvement.  "The public has a right to know both the full extent of Justice Kagan's involvement with this legislation while she was (the Justice Department's) solicitor general, as well as her previously stated views and opinions about the legislation while she was serving as solicitor general," Smith wrote.  Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell and three other senators echoed calls for more records on Kagan's government correspondence.  The 51-year-old Kagan was the administration's top government lawyer handling appeals to the Supreme Court. Her nomination by Obama in May 2010, and the weeks leading up to it, came at a time when Congress had passedand the president signedthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The health care reform law would significantly change how Americans receive medical services and has been the subject of six current appeals pending at the high court. Twenty-eight states and dozens of individual plaintiffs have opposed the law.  During her confirmation hearings to the high court last year, Kagan said she sat in "at least one meeting where the existence of the litigation was briefly mentioned, but none where any substantive discussion of the litigation occurred." The White House has long insisted that she was "walled off" from involvement in the internal health care law discussions.  After two conservative groups sued, the department turned over some documents related to Kagan. One e-mail from her to fellow department official Laurence Tribe talked about an upcoming House vote on health care: "I hear they have the votes, Larry!! Simply amazing."  Another e-mail from her deputy at the time, Neal Katyal, indicated that Kagan asked her office "to be involved in this set of issues."  That, says conservative lawyer Carrie Severino, proves that Kagan is "the justice who knew too much."  "The president is now asking her to adopt the very same positions her office helped craft for him on this matter, but this time, as a Supreme Court justice," said Severino, of the Judicial Crisis Network. "Her jump from advocate to judge on the same issue raises profound questions about the propriety of her continued participation in his case. Moreover, the legitimacy of any decision where she is in the majority or plurality would be instantly suspect if she chooses not to recuse herself."  Severino is a former law clerk to Thomas, himself the target of attacks on the left.  Thomas' wife opposed health care law  Congressional Democrats have separately called on Thomas to pull out, citing his recent lapse in reporting the income of his wife for 13 straight years, as required by federal disclosure laws.  The justice said the information was "inadvertently omitted," and his defenders note that his wife's employment history for a variety of conservative causes was widely publicized.  Virginia Thomas had worked for, and later founded, her own advocacy group, Liberty Central. Since she has openly opposed the health care bill, many liberals have said, her political activities raise questions about Justice Thomas' own judicial independence and impartiality.  "To believe that Justice Thomas didn't know how to fill out a basic disclosure form is absurd," said Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, on behalf of 20 colleagues. "I cannot determine guilt or innocence, but I can request that the government do our due diligence in investigating a situation that strikes me, and many members of Congress, as suspicious."  Slaughter separately has asked the Justice Department and judiciary's administrative office to investigate.  Thomas' liberal colleaguescurrent Justice Stephen Breyer and retired Justice John Paul Stevenshave recently defended him, suggesting that he can hear the health care cases with impartiality.  Progressive groups Common Cause and Alliance for Justice say the Scalia/Thomas celebratory dinner was a "stunning breach of ethics." The Federalist Society event, say liberals, was nothing more than a fundraiser, with donors that included pharmaceutical company Pfizer.  "The justices were wining and dining at a black-tie fundraiser with attorneys who have pending cases before the court," Common Cause President Bob Edgar said. "Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality and is unacceptable."  Among those on the official program for the dinner were McConnell and attorney Paul Clement, himself a former solicitor general, who will argue the health care cases as a private lawyer on behalf of a coalition of two dozen states.  Justices ultimately make the call  Unlike other members of the federal judiciary, the justices decide for themselves whether a conflict of interest exists, requiring disqualification.  The binding Code of Conduct of U.S. Judges requires recusal when "impartiality might reasonably be questioned," including having a family member directly involved in the case or if there is a financial interest, such as a justice owning stock in company being sued.  In Kagan's case, the code also demands recusal if a judgewhile serving in government"participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case or controversy."  As a result, the newest justice had decided on her own to withdraw from considering at least 28 other cases the high court eventually accepted for review.  The court by tradition will not openly discuss when to recuse, and that is true with Thomas, Kagan and Scalia. It also will not speculate on the outcome of cases or succumb to political or legal analysis. The written opinion will be the only way the court will officially speak.  "While the health care cases have huge political overtones, obviously, I think the justices are probably going to put them to the side," said Scotusblog.com's Goldstein. "The legal stakes are so high that I don't think they'll pay attention that much, if at all, to the fact that it's occurring in an election cycle. They have just got to get the case right."  Not having to explain themselves when ethical issues arise has led to well-meaning criticism to justices are ultimately accountable to no one, perhaps too arrogant or detached to see warning signs, that may do ultimate damage to the prestige and well-earned independence the courts have earned.  But saying nothing or doing nothing in the face of such criticism is the familiar chosen path of a justice, whose professional and personal makeup urges a cautious, detached approach. For Thomas and Kagan, that will probably be enough to keep them participating in the health care scrum. For them, the bigger fights are not from outside but within the marbled walls of the court itself: the competitive, often ruthless internal command for a five-vote majority.  All else is a mere prologue to a story nine robed people will soon be writing.

U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice withdrew her name from consideration Thursday for secretary of state. Over the past few months, a slew of articles have criticized Rice's personality. The Daily Beast recently ran a piece titled "Susan Rice's Personality Disorder." These articles allege that America's U.N. ambassador is "brusque," "dismissive," "undiplomatic," "shrill" and awful to work for. I felt compelled to write something because these caricatures of Rice bear no resemblance to my former boss.  I worked for Susan Rice in 2009 and 2010 as her special assistant in the Washington office of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. Over the past few weeks, I have talked to other junior staffers for Ricecurrent and formerwho all share my surprise at the way she has been described.  Junior staffers see a side of their "principal"Washington-speak for bossthat others do not. Being a special assistant involves a wide swath of activities: couriering papers, sitting in on meetings and delving into some policy issues. In this multifaceted role, my colleagues and I saw Rice as a boss, as a diplomat and as a person. In each arena, Rice demonstrated a rare combination of openness, honesty and passion.  Read more: Susan Rice withdraws from consideration as secretary of state  Early on in the job, I delivered a 50-page paper on Afghanistan to Rice. Before I could set it down on her desk, she asked, "What do you think of it?" I hadn't read a word and froze.  I soon found out that this was typical of Rice. She always asks people at all levels what they think; she's not concerned with hierarchy or status, just ideas. You see this in her strategy meetings, which always involve staff at all levels. You also see this when Rice tours foreign countries. She is just as interested in the stories of people on the streets as the proclamations of ministersand often more so.  Democrat 'extremely upset' with Rice's withdrawal  As a diplomat, Rice can be extraordinarily charming. She can put new acquaintances instantly at ease. But she can just as easily snap them to attention.  Rice has little patience for dissembling and her insistence on thorough preparation means that she invariably knows the subject matter as well asand usually better thanher interlocutor. This enables Rice to move from charm to hard substance in an instant, getting to the heart of an issue quickly. Some people have criticized this aspect of Rice's personality as "undiplomatic." If diplomacy is the art of talking and doing nothing, then perhaps they're right. But that has never been Susan Rice.  Rice is in government because she believes in strengthening America and improving this world. Rice believes that advancing core principles serves U.S. interests in the long run. You can see this belief guiding her approach to issue after issue, in meeting after meeting.  Read more: Rice's letter to the President  Rice is down to earth, too, which won the loyalty of her slightly younger staffers in particular. She has an inexplicably vast collection of go-go musica D.C. invention. She has mastered social media and new technology, but only after overcoming a healthy dose of skepticism. And she has a general demeanor, some combination of athlete and wonk, that conveys cool.  I don't mean to minimize the serious policy issues she has handled as U.N. ambassador, a member of President Obama's Cabinet and a lifelong public servant. One op-ed is not enough space to engage her many accomplishments in government and the various policy disputes that inevitably arise over 20 years in high office.  Opinion: A lucky day for Susan Rice  All I can say in this short pieceand say with total confidenceis that Susan Rice is a wonderful person and an inspiring boss. Washington is filled with people seeking power for its own sake; people embroiled in partisan politics; petty people; imperious, dismissive people; people who put themselves before others. But that is not Susan Rice.  The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amar C. Bakshi.  
 Veteran Jim Furyk produced the round of the day at the Tour Championship in Atlanta after carding a score of 64 at East Lake.  The American birdied six of the first nine holes to record an outward 29 as he raced through the field.  Furyk won the FedEX Cup $10 million prize two years ago and looked to have an incredible opportunity to record a 59 after hitting seven birdies in the first ten holes.  He also claimed birdies at the 15th and 17th but bogeys at the 13th, 16th and 18th left him just two shots clear at the top of the leader board.  England's Justin Rose shot a 68 to move into second place on six-under-par.  The joint overnight leader hit five birdies to remain in contention following his opening round of 66.  But World No.1 Rory McIlroy remained in pole position to claim that $10 prize for overall winner of the playoffs after producing his 10th consecutive sub-70 score.  McIlroy sank a 25-foot eagle putt on the 16th to ensure he finished with a round of 68 and leave him four shots off the lead at halfway.  The Northern Irishman was joined on three-under-par by Americans Robert Garrigus and Zach Johnson after both players hit rounds of 69.  Woods and Rose share first round lead  But Tiger Woods, who shot an opening round 66 to share the lead with Rose, struggled to produce a repeat performance.  Woods, whose last win came at July's AT & T National, could only manage a 73 to leave him on one-under-par, a setback to his challenge to McIlroy for the playoffs title.  Masters champion Bubba Watson moved into contention on five-under-par alongside Bo Van Pelt, with Matt Kuchar and Dustin Johnson a shot further back.  Last year's money list winner Luke Donald of England shot a 69 to finish level par at the halfway stage, while his compatriot Lee Westwood was 28th out of 30 on five-over-par following a disappointing round of 73.  .

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan Pakistan's military killed at least 55 militants over the past 24 hours as part of its week-long crackdown on Taliban militants, an army spokesman said Friday.  Pakistani security personnel patrol the troubled Buner district.  This week's military operation resulted in more than 230 militant casualties since Sunday, while the military suffered two deaths and eight injuries, according to spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas.  He has said he hopes the operation will be completed by the end of the week.  The operation is part of the Pakistani army's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions.  The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, which have rankled relations between the two countries.  Meanwhile, Afghan and coalition forces in southern Afghanistan killed 15 militants and wounded 12 others, the U.S. military reported.  The incident, which took place early Friday morning in the Arghandab District of Zabul province, occurred after a military convoy was attacked.  "The patrol was en route to a local village to talk with elders about security issues in the area when they were attacked by several armed militants with small-arms fire from a compound. The combined force returned fire killing one militant," the military said in a statement.  As Afghan security forces secured and searched that and other compounds to make sure there "were no non-combatants in danger," militants shot at troops and the soldiers fired backed.  The Afghan and coalition forces pursued the militants into a "nearby cave complex" where 14 militants were killed and 12 were wounded. Another militant was detained.  
 U.S. and allied airstrikes in Iraq and Syria are changing the battlefield below. The Pentagon sees progress, even if it's a slog. But there may be unintended consequences of the air campaignin a way that will give the West yet another headache.  The two most powerful Islamist groups in Syriathe Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusrahave spent much of the last year killing each other. But in an interview with CNN, a senior al-Nusra commander says the two groups now have a common enemy: the "crusaders' coalition."  Abu Al-Muthana al-Ansari, an al-Nusra commander in Aleppo, said in a Skype interview: "We can't fight on the crusaders' side against a Muslim. Allah said in the Koran that 'those who support them become one of them.'"  Two groups, whose bitter split was a windfall for other rebel groups and for the West, may be making up.  Al-Nusra leader Abu Muhammad al-Julaniin a rare public declarationhas described the airstrikes as an assault on Islam, and warned the Western public: "This is what will take the battle to the heart of your land, for the Muslims will not stand as spectators watching their sons bombed and killed in their lands, while you stay safe in your lands."  Were ISIS and al-Nusra to call a truce or even unite under one banner in the face of U.S. bombardment, the balance of power among rebel groups in Syria would change radically. A militant Islamist coalition would likely overwhelm more moderate rebel groupsand pose a greater threat to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  Against a background of mistrust and brutality, a formal ISIS-al-Nusra alliance does not seem on the tablebut if al-Ansari is correct, more "local understandings" against Syrian regime forces are likely.  Asked about a recent statement by ISIS that it would soon extend its presence in southern Syria (the northern provinces of Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor are its strongholds), al-Ansari welcomed the declaration.  "We support any group that raises the flag of Allah and his Prophet and fights the infidel Alawites, and there is coordination in Al-Qalamoun [an area on the Syria-Lebanon border]," he said. Qalamoun has seen heavy clashes between Islamist rebel groups and Syrian regime militia, supported by the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah. Reports from the area Sunday spoke of high casualties as al-Nusra and ISIS joined forces against Hezbollah.  "There is mutual understanding between us and the brothers in the Islamic State not to fight each other and fight the Infidel [al-Assad] regime," al-Ansari added.  ISIS appears to have reciprocated. It says it has released from jails in Raqqa many of the al-Nusra commanders and fighters it captured during fighting between the groups.  Anger over strikes on al-Nusra  U.S. officials said the targets in the first strikes on Syria last month included buildings west of Aleppo belonging to a group called Khorasan, an offshoot of al-Nusra focused on attacking the West. But at least one senior al-Nusra commander, Abu Yousuf al Turki, was reported killed in those strikes in the town of Kfar Deryan.  Documents later found in the rubble by Jenan Moussa, a respected reporter for Dubai-based network Al Aan, suggest that an elite group inside al-Nusra known as the Wolf Unit had been hit.  Moussa posted photographs of documents with the names of 13 foreign fighters who belonged to the Wolf Unit, including al Turki.  CNN cannot verify the documents. But al-Ansari suggested there was no difference between "the brothers in Khorasan" and al-Nusra, saying "they are not a separate organization. Everyone in al-Nusra in Syria follows the al Qaeda organization."  Whatever debate there may be over the name of the unit targeted, and who was killed, the strikes appear to have hardened the resolve of al-Nusra.  In his audio message, released five days after the U.S. strikes, al-Julani said: "Do not let the West and America take advantage of the injustice of the Islamic State upon you ...Those who are unable to repulse the Islamic State or others, then let them do so without being a partner with the crusader alliance." In other words: However bad ISIS are, don't take sides with the West.  Al-Julani stopped short of holding out an olive branch to ISIS. The only way al-Nusra could formally join ISIS is by pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, thereby declaring its own extinction. Al-Nusra leaders will also be aware that if Western strikes severely degrade ISIS, al-Nusra could fill the void.  The acid test will be what happens at local level. The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights reports that a few dozen al-Nusra fighters joined ISIS in the Aleppo area after U.S. airstrikes began. Further targeting of al-Nusra facilities by U.S. strikes might hasten that process.  Also critical in coming weeks will be the relationship between al-Nusra and more moderate rebel groups. A recent analysis from the International Crisis Group (ICG) concluded that al-Nusra "overcame initial unpopularity among mainstream activists and militants to earn broad acceptance as an authentic, Syrian component of the uprising."  In the words of one secular rebel, quoted by the ICG, "Everyone cooperates with al-Nusra to some extent; sometimes you need them to come in and blow something up."  But al-Julani warned al-Nusra will fight any group that takes American cash and weapons, condemning "the traitorous factions that were bought by the West with some money and ammunition so as to be a pawn in its hands ..." according to a translation by SITE Intelligence.  Al-Ansari, the al-Nusra commander in Aleppo, echoed that line, telling CNN: "Those who seek glory without Allah's support will be humiliated.  And if it was proved that the brothers in the Free Syrian Army and other Mujahedeen have taken weapons form America, then we cannot work with them. America is the one who fought Islam and Muslims everywhere."  The problem is these groups need al-Nusra's help against both ISIS and the regimebut they also need Washington's money, training and weapons to survive. Some are angry that U.S. bombs have fallen on al-Nusra rather than the bases and troops of the al-Assad regime; it just makes their job more difficult.  The outcome may be some form of "don't ask, don't tell," whereby some rebel groups will get U.S. help but continue to co-operate and even share resources with al-Nusra. That is not to suggest mutual trust; groups like the Syrian Revolutionaries' Front are wary of al-Nusra's goal of an Islamic state in Syria and of its more aggressive approach to other factions in recent months. But they are incapable of taking on al-Nusra, ISIS and the al-Assad regime; it would be tactical suicide.  The anatomy of ISIS: How the 'Islamic State' is run  The view from head office  The evolving Syrian battle lines will be closely monitored by al-Zawahiri and al Qaeda's senior leadership in the Afghan-Pakistan border area. They will want al-Nusra to hold the line against ISIS, rather than ride to the rescue of a prodigal son. Al-Zawahiri was both humiliated and eclipsed by ISIS' defiance of al Qaeda, appalled by its nihilistic violence and outraged by al-Baghdadi's impudence in declaring himself 'Caliph.'  Just two days before al-Julani's message was released, an al Qaeda spokesman reiterated the party line. In a 15-minute taped speech, Abu Dujana al-Basha managed to avoid mentioning ISIS, but the message was unmistakable.  The ISIS caliphate, he said, was illegitimate. "We call to restore the rightly-guided caliphate on the prophetic method, and not on the method of deviation, lying, breaking promises, and abrogating allegiances," al-Basha declared, according to a translation by SITE.  And he condemned "people of extremism, ignorance, and excessiveness, who infidel-brand the worshipers, kill the monotheists, sow corruption in jihad"barely disguised code for ISIS.  The theme is repeated; there will be no accommodation with "those who helped ignite sedition." So it would be a severe blow to al Qaeda if al-Nusra were to fold itself into ISIS.  Counterterrorism analysts argue about whether the tail is wagging the dog: whether al-Zawahiri is trying breathlessly to keep up with myriad groups adopting the al Qaeda moniker, or actually shaping their activities.  FBI Director James Comey said recently: "There is not a highly capable, functioning AQSL [al Qaeda Senior Leadership]" in the Afghanistan-Pakistan area.  Khorasanin his estimationwas another example of the affiliates overshadowing the leadership thanks to "refugees from Afghanistan and Pakistan."  The worst outcome for al-Zawahiri and al Qaeda's senior leadership would be for ISIS to survive and defy an extensive campaign to destroy it, and instead to hold or even take more territory. Its intent is to do just that, believing attack is the best form of defense. Within the past two weeks, it has captured scores of Kurdish villages in northeastern Syria, laid siege to the town of Kobani, stepped up the pressure in the Aleppo countryside and evicted the Iraqi army from several bases in Anbar province.  ISIS' ability to withstand U.S. and allied strikes and to hold its ground will be decisive in shaping the attitudes of other rebel groupsincluding al-Nusraas well as al Qaeda central and the al-Assad regime.

Brazilian police worked for five months to track down a fugitive American pastor accused of dozens of sexual assaults in Minnesota.  Victor Arden Barnard, 53, was arrested Friday at a home in a gated community, said the Public Security Secretariat of Rio Grande do Norte state. A 33-year-old woman was detained, police said.  Both were transported to a federal jail in Lagoa Nova in Natal, awaiting extradition to the United States, authorities said.  Barnard is suspected of 59 counts of sexual assault in Minnesota. He is accused of sexually abusing two young girls who were members of his church, the U.S. Marshals Service said.  The last U.S. sighting of Barnard was last year in Raymond, Washington. The fugitive was featured on CNN's "The Hunt With John Walsh" last year and again last week.  Barnard was featured on the U.S. Marshal's 15 Most Wanted List along with a $25,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. In addition to the sexual assault allegations, he was also wanted for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.  As a pastor, Barnard inspired his congregants with his charisma and apparent devotion to the teachings of Jesus Christ.  "I had never met anybody that I thought loved the word of God as much as Victor Barnard did," said Ruth Johnson, a former member of Barnard's River Road Fellowship.  Barnard set up a so-called "shepherd's camp" in the mid-1990s in Pine County. Several congregants moved to the rural area about 100 miles north of Minneapolis to be a part of the camp.  In June 2000, the pastor allegedly convinced some members of his congregation to hand over their firstborn daughters to live with him in a secluded campsite.  Lindsay Tornambe's name was called, and her parents allowed their 13-year-old daughter to join the group of girls at the camp, called "The Maidens," under Barnard's supervision. She and other congregants said the girls got up early, sewed, cooked and cleaned.  "Everything that a wife would do, they did for him," Johnson said.  Barnard proclaimed he was Christ on Earth.  "He taught that in the Bible, the church was the bride of Christ and because he was Christ in the flesh, the church was supposed to be married to him," Tornambe said. "At that time, I didn't really understand the fullness of what it meant."  The complaint filed in Minnesota says Tornambe alleges she was sexually abused by Barnard from the ages of 13 to 22 while she and her parents were members of River Road Fellowship. She told investigators the group of 10 young girls and women were known as Alamoths, or maidens. Her group was sent to what she thought was a summer camp, the document says.  Tornambe told investigators Barnard sexually assaulted her one to three times a month until she left in 2010 to be with her parents, who had moved to Pennsylvania.  In fall 2011, Tornambe was contacted by another former maiden who shared a similar story: She said she was molested by Barnard from the time she was 12 until she was 20, although she said the number of sexual acts varied each month.  Tornambe and the other woman went to the police in Minnesota. Barnard had moved to Washington state after an admission to affairs with married women caused the religious group to split, the complaint says.  The ministry operated in a secluded area of Pine County from about 2000 until 2011 or 2012, Chief Deputy Steven Blackwell of the county sheriff's office told CNN last year.  The fellowship left the property shortly after a new sheriff was elected and began investigating the ministry, Blackwell said. Afterward, The Salvation Army started running a family camp there.  CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.  
 Bad news, guys: The pangolin we adopted is missing.  You may recall a vote I held online recentlyasking readers to suggest new names for pangolin P26, who was released into a national park in Vietnam in March. The names you suggested were lovely: Pemalu, which is Indonesian for "shy"; Bao, which is Vietnamese for "protection." AndSandshrew, a scale-covered Pokemon character that even I'll admit does bear a striking resemblance to a real-life panoglin.  Of course, since you're the Internet, you voted up Sandshrew.  So that's P26's new name.  And now Sandshrew is missing.  I'm not drawing any correlation between the two. Obviously. Of course not ...  Let me back up in case you haven't been following this story: Pangolins are thought to be the most trafficked mammals in the world. They're traded illegally and by the ton for their scales, which are used in traditional medicine and for their meat, which is a delicacy in Vietnam and China. I recently spent some time investigating the pangolin trade in Southeast Asia as part of CNN's Change the List project. One pangolin I met was named P26and had been seized from the illegal trade and taken to the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program in Vietnam. He recently was released into Cat Tien National Park. I thought it would be fun for CNN's audience to adopt and rename the pangolin, and the researchers who care for him kindly agreed.  Turns out, the researchers kind of like the name Sandshrew.  "I guess it is kinda cute(ish)," one wrote in an e-mail.  "Well, anything is better than P26 right?!"  And they think it might help with his rescue.  In a Wednesday blog post, Louise Fletcher, from the conservation program, wrote that P26's (sorry, Sandshrew's) radio tracking device had partially fallen off his tail. This happens quite a lot with this type of pangolin, she told me. The transmitting devices are fairly clunky, and they're screwed into a scale that's made of fingernail material.  Now, she is scouring the forest trying to find him. She's set up "camera traps" that might snap a photo of the nocturnal animal if he's roaming around at night, looking for ants. And she's spending some time just wandering the park at night hoping to see him.  No luck so far.  "Maybe if the voting by CNN readers is complete on deciding P26s new name, I can see if whispering it as we walk through the forest on Thursday night will be successful in coaxing him into view!" she wrote.  Maybe! I hope so. I sent her an e-mail telling her the new name for P26 is Sandshrew. I'm holding out hope that Fletcher will find him by whispering "Saaaandshrewwwww" into the forest of Vietnam. I kind of love imagining that scene, and wish her luck.  If you want to follow her progress, and Sandshrew's, check out her blog.  And thanks to everyone who voted.  One more favor to ask: Maybe the fact that there's a real-life endangered creature named after a video game character means Nintendo and Pokemon will start supporting pangolin conservation? Maybe someone can suggest that by starting a Change.org petition? So far, more than 4,000 people have signed a reader's petition asking for Disney to put a pangolin in a movie.  Maybe there's a similarly creative ask for Pokemon?  For more in this series, visit CNN.com/Change.

Washington The glitch-plagued rollout of President Barack Obama's signature health care law has been dogged by one big question: How many people have enrolled in an insurance plan?  The White House refuses to release the numbers, leading many to assume they are embarrassingly low. But insurance industry insiders point to another reason: Nobody knows if the numbers they do have are even accurate.  Turns out, some insurance companies say they are receiving data from the administration that is incomplete, duplicative or contradictory, making it difficult to get an accurate count of new enrollment.  Opinion: Why healthcare.gov has so many problems  So far, most of the attention has focused on people being unable to sign up for coverage through online health care exchanges. But even when customers manage to make it through the enrollment process, glitches persist.  "The administration is not wrong in saying that there's been a lot of problems with signing up. But it's incorrect to say that's the only problem," an insurance industry official said. "That's not the only issue at hand."  Industry officials who were contacted requested anonymity to speak candidly because of the superheated politics surrounding Obamacare.  Opinion: Will glitches derail Obamacare?  The sign-up process works this way: A person sets up an online account, verifies an identity, applies for coverage and subsidies and, if eligible, shops and enrolls for a plan. Once completed, information is sent to the insurance plans selected by the user.  At 6 p.m. each day, the government sends the latest batch of new enrollees to insurance companies. But sometimes that data come with conflicting information, showing for instance, someone who enrolled and then canceled a plan, said an insurance industry executive. Other times data come in without a time stamp, making it difficult to track, the executive said.  Adding to the confusion, the executive said, is that people are not officially enrolled in a plan until they pay their first premiums, which are not due until December 15. That means shoppers have about two months to cancel or switch plans before making a final decision of whether or not to enroll.  Success on day 14 of Obamacare website  An administration official did not dispute there have been problems with data sent by the government to insurers.  "We know that people are enrolling in coverage and the system works. As individual problems are raised by insurers, we work aggressively to address them," said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.  An HHS official said enrollment numbers will likely be released in mid-November, giving officials time to verify their accuracy.  Former Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs had harsh words for the administration, saying the October 1 rollout was "bungled badly."  "I hope they're working day and night to get this done, and when they get it fixed, I hope they fire some people that were in charge of making sure this thing was supposed to work," Gibbs said Monday on MSNBC.  'Cumbersome, glitchy' system  So far, the buzz in the insurance industry is that enrollment numbers are falling short of projections. One insurance company executive put it this way, "The numbers aren't as bad as the doomsday people would say. But so far, they're low and they have people worried."  
 Carlos Sainz is closing on his first Dakar Rally car title after extending his lead with victory on Tuesday's 10th stage in the South American event.  The Spaniard, who led last year's race before crashing out on the 12th stage, was 10 minutes and six seconds ahead of Volkswagen teammate Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar after triumphing on the 238-kilometer leg from La Serena to Santiago.  It was the two-time world rally champion's first stage win in this year's event and the 16th of his career, and leaves him in prime position to win with three legs to go.  Al-Attiyah finished the day in fourth as he lost one minute and 40 seconds to Sainz, but was still more than 18 minutes ahead of third-placed American Mark Miller in another Volkswagen.  Miller was third on the stage, with Frenchman Stephane Peterhansel second28 seconds behind Sainz.  Peterhansel, who has won six motorbike titles and three in a four-wheeler, is more than two hours behind Sainz in fourth place in the overall standings.  "Eighty kilometers after the start we caught up with Nasser," Sainz told the race's official Web site. "We stayed behind him because he couldn't hear the Sentinel and we couldn't get past.  "It was quite a slow and winding route, mostly lanes. What I did first was to get close to Nasser, then I stayed around at 1:40. After that, from the 80km point onwards, we were driving in the dust."  Al-Attiyah, who won the ninth stage, said he struggled after having to lead out the field.  "It was very dangerous at that speed. There were a lot of corners, a lot of slippery stuff. For me it was not a good feeling and I'm really happy to have finished this stage without any problems," he said.  "Today it was very stressful because I opened the road. Tomorrow there will be some off-road and more dunes. It will be good for me."  Peterhansel's compatriot Cyril Despres leads the bike class by one hour, 22 minutes and 49 seconds despite finishing only sixth on Tuesday.  Spain's Marc Coma, also riding a KTM machine, won the stage by more than two minutes from another Frenchman, David Fretigne, but is way back in 17th overall.  Russia's Vladimir Chagin is more than an hour ahead in the truck class after following up his stage win on Monday with another victory.  Wednesday's 11th stage sees the race move from Chile back into Argentina.

Washington Two influential U.S. senators introduced a resolution Tuesday expressing support for limited American involvement in the NATO-led military campaign in Libyapart of an effort to counter rising pressure in the House of Representatives to withdraw backing for the mission.  Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner proposed two resolutions on the Libya mission that could come up for votes on Thursday. One would be the same as the Senate resolution introduced Tuesday, and the other would limit U.S. involvement in the mission to a noncombat role while allowing many of the same functions being performed now by U.S. forces to continue.  The House proposal seeking a noncombat role reflects frustration in Congress over what Boehner and others call President Barack Obama's failure to get necessary congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution for engaging U.S. forces in the Libya military campaign.  "If the Commander-in-Chief believes that intervention in Libya is important for our national security, he has a responsibility to make a case for itclearly and publiclyand seek authorization," Boehner said in a statement announcing the two proposed House resolutions. "In the three months since military action in Libya began, none of this has occurred. The American people deserve to have their voice heard in this debate, and Congress has a responsibility to hold the White House accountable."  The Senate resolution, introduced by Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry and Arizona Republican John McCain, authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops.  "I believe the president did the right thing by intervening to stop a looming humanitarian disaster," McCain said.  "I believe we will find a strong, bipartisan majority that is in favor of authorizing our current military operations in Libya and seeing this mission through to success."  Kerry added, "By supporting this resolution, we tell Arabs young and old that the United States is willing to make tough decisions and spend our tax dollars to help ensure your freedom."  The allied military effort, which already has formal U.N. support, was launched to protect Libyan civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by the North African country's longtime ruler, Moammar Gadhafi. Western leaders have made clear, however, that they believe the mission cannot be successfully completed without Gadhafi's ouster.  The Obama administration has already promised not to use U.S. ground troops, but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has been mounting. An unusual coalition has formed between traditionally anti-war Democrats and conservative Republicans worried about the cost of the conflict and skeptical of its national security importance.  One of the House resolutions under consideration will be the same as the McCain-Kerry proposal that supports the current limited U.S. role in the mission, Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement. A House GOP leadership source said the measure is expected to be defeated.  The second House resolution would remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Libya, except for those engaged in nonhostile actions including search and rescue; aerial refueling; operational planning; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and noncombat missions. While the resolution would be nonbinding, its approval by the House would signal strong opposition to Obama's decision to commit U.S. forces without seeking authorization from Congress.  A House leadership aide said the second resolution is aimed at U.S. military drones and any other combat role by U.S. forces in Libya, and is likely to pass in the Republican-controlled chamber.  House Republicans will meet Wednesday to further discuss the issue, and GOP leaders were not ruling out possible changes or additions to the resolutions.  Critics contend the 1973 War Powers Resolution gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war, followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities. The combined 90-day period ended Sunday.  Support for the war has also been shaken by evidence presented by Gadhafi's government of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent NATO airstrikes.  NATO officials admitted over the weekend that aircraft from countries in the alliance had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition.  The White House argues the president didn't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and haven't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities. Obama, however, personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, according to a Saturday report in The New York Times.  In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, have resisted holding a vote on the war because of divisions within their respective caucuses.  Reid said Tuesday that there is bipartisan support for the McCain-Kerry resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but that he was still in discussion with the two sponsors on when to bring the measure from the panel to the Senate floor.  He indicated it could be brought to the floor as early as this week.  McConnell, meanwhile, told reporters that "we all anticipate that there will be some kind of Libya debate in the Senate in the near future."  McCain has expressed anger that the White House didn't push for an earlier congressional vote on the war. The senator, who ran against Obama in 2008, contends a resolution of support would have passed easily when NATO first intervened.  "The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive," McCain said Tuesday. "The unfortunate result of this failure of leadership is plain to see in the full-scale revolt ... that is occurring in the House of Representatives."  The House is also planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill later this week, and liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, intends to propose an amendment cutting off funding for the mission. However, that amendment is likely to only come up next month after the House returns from its Fourth of July recess.  To prevent a similar resolution from Kucinich from passing earlier, Boehner pushed through a resolution giving the president two weeks to send Congress information justifying the U.S. strategy in Libya.  Obama responded with a 32-page report arguing in part that he has not violated the War Powers Resolution.  Even if the Republican-controlled House passes measures intended to limit funding for the Libya mission, it is unlikely the Senate would do the same.  "The president's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya, but I will be no part of an effort to defund Libya or to try to cut off our efforts to bring Gadhafi down," conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday.  Obama "needs to step up his game with Libya, but Congress should sort of shut up and not empower Gadhafi," Graham argued.  In March, the Senate unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting the no-fly zone over Libya. Some Republicans, however, have now expressed opposition to that effort, citing growing concerns about its cost.  In its report on the mission, the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $800 million. It estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $1.1 billion.  Questions about the war's financial and other costs have also been raised in the United Kingdom, which has played a leading role in the NATO effort.  British Prime Minister David Cameron insists that Britain's military involvement in the North African country can continue "as long as we need."  CNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Dan Lothian, Alan Silverleib and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.  
 Washington The U.S. government's drug strategy should focus more on treating addiction and less on imposing harsh prison sentences, the White House said Tuesday.  "Outdated policies like the mass incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders are relics of the past that ignore the need for a balanced public health and safety approach to our drug problem," Gil Kerlikowske, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said in a statement.  The office's annual report to Congress suggests a "new national approach" that includes criminal justice system reforms aimed at stopping "the revolving door of drug use, crime, incarceration, and rearrest," officials said in a statement.  "The policy alternatives contained in our new strategy support mainstream reforms based on the proven facts that drug addiction is a disease of the brain that can be prevented and treated and that we cannot simply arrest our way out of the drug problem," said Kerlikowske, who is known as the nation's "drug czar."  Since U.S. President Barack Obama tapped him for the job in 2009, Kerlikowske has made it clear that the United States needs to do a better job of treating addicts to try to reduce the demand for narcotics.  Tuesday's report builds on an approach administration officials have promoted since 2010, Kerlikowske, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said in a joint statement posted on the White House website.  "It outlines ways to break the cycle of drug use, crime, incarceration, and arrest by diverting nonviolent drug offenders into treatment, bolstering support for re-entry programs that help offenders rejoin their communities and advancing support for innovative enforcement programs proven to improve public health while protecting public safety," the statement said.  Overall drug use in the United States has "dropped substantially" over the past 30 years, the policy office said Tuesday. Cocaine consumption in the United States had decreased 40% from 2006 to 2010, and methamphetamine use had dropped 50% in that same period, the office said.  But in the report, President Obama said "serious drug-related challenges remain," including prescription drug abuse and the large number of people who need treatment for substance abuse but do not receive it.  "Young people's perceptions of the risks of drug use have declined over the past decade, and research suggests that this often predicts future increases in drug use," Obama wrote.  The report's release came two days after the end of the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, where Western Hemisphere leaders agreed that the Organization of American States would begin a study examining alternatives for fighting drug-fueled organized crime.  The war on drugs drew some of the sharpest distinctions among leaders at the two-day gathering.  On Saturday, leaders debated how to address drug trafficking and violence in the hemisphere, with several calling for new approachessomething Obama said he was open to, though he closed the door on legalization.

A U.S. District Court judge has overturned South Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage.  The ruling, by Judge Richard M. Gergel in Charleston, does not mean an immediate issuance of marriage licenses for same-sex couples, however. The judge set the order to go into effect on November 20, to give opponents time to appeal if they wish.  Gergel, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of provisions of the state constitution or state laws or policy "to the extent that they seek to prohibit the marriage of same sex couples."  If the judge's ruling stands and same-sex marriage becomes legal, South Carolina would become the 33rd state in which same-sex marriage has become legal.  Same-sex marriage is under court review in Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana and Texas.  It is banned in 12 other states.  
 Less than a month after two lung transplant surgeries to save Sarah Murnaghan's life, the 10-year-old has developed pneumonia in her second set of replacement lungs, her mother posted on Monday.  Sarah has developed pneumonia in her right lung, her mother, Janet Murnaghan posted on her Facebook page. Physicians believe it was caused by aspirations from her belly, she wrote, meaning contents from her stomach went through the wrong pipes and into her lungs.  "Yesterday was tough," Murnaghan wrote. "Today she is more stable, but this is definitely a large set back."  The lungs were infected with pneumonia before they were implanted, but this is a new infection.  Pneumonia is not uncommon after any type of lung surgery, CNN's Sanjay Gupta said.  "Sarah had an even higher increased risk because she's taking immune-suppressing drugs and because of her cystic fibrosis," Gupta said. "But even with a setback like this infection, nearly 80% of people survive at least one year after lung transplant."  Sarah was born with cystic fibrosis.  Her family pushed for a change national transplant policy as they fought for her to be eligible for adult lung donations. Her family had been told she had five weeks to live in May, and she had been on a transplant list for children's lungs for 18 months  After the Murnaghans petitioned, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network's executive committee approved a one-year change that makes children younger than 12 eligible to be on adult lung transplant priority lists.  Sarah received her first transplant lungs June 12, one week after she became eligible for adult lungs. The donated lungs were poor quality, but the family proceeded with the surgery because "Sarah was out of time to wait."  The lungs failed shortly afterward, and Sarah underwent emergency surgery to put her on a bypass machine to keep oxygen pumping through her body.  She received a new set of lungs three days later.  Family members knew the lungs were infected with pneumonia before the surgery, but they went ahead with the transplant because "they were Sarah's best and only hope."  Despite the infection, her family had reported steady improvement up until Monday.  In the same post, Janet Murnaghan thanks everyone for their thoughts and prayers.  "We have an amazing team of doctors who go above and beyond but also walk this road with us in such a kind and compassionate way," she wrote. "Thankful to God for this day!"

LONDON, England When it comes to making movies, Australia would appear to have it all.  Baz Luhrmann's latest film "Australia" starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman is the first identifiably Australian blockbuster.  A huge landmass with a location for every movie eventuality, from the post-apocalyptic desert seen in "Mad Max" to sophisticated central Sydney through John Woo's lens in "Mission: Impossible II."  Compared with, say, the United States, it's a relatively cheap place to film. By filming sci-fi blockbuster "The Matrix" in Sydney, the Wachowski Brothers were able to keep their budget down to $60 million. Making the same film in the United States would have cost three times as much, they say.  And then there's the talent. Directors like Philip Noyce ("The Quiet American," "Rabbit Proof Fence") and Baz Luhrmann ("Strictly Ballroom," "Moulin Rouge!") and stars including Cate Blanchett and Nicole Kidman all hail from Down Under.  Over the years, the Australian film industry has produced groundbreaking and remarkable movies like "Shine," "Muriel's Wedding" and more recently "Lantana" that have burst out of the domestic movie market and made a splash internationally.  But breakout successes like these are few and far between.  Despite the industry producing quality films since the 70s, it has failed to build its accomplishments into a sustainable domestic film market.  Some of the problem is down to size. Australia may be big but its population is tiny, coming in at a little over 21 millionjust twice the number of people living in the city of Sao Paolo, Brazil alone.  This has meant limited government funding for the film industry and over the last five years, an average of just $20 million (AUS) ($19 million) has been raised each year from private investors.  So for domestic flicks there just isn't much money to go aroundaverage budgets are between $4-8 million (AUS) ($3.8-7.6 million).  Although there are exceptions, low budgets mean Aussie filmmakers have struggled to come up with the kind of slick productions that make it to international distribution.  "Boutique" is the euphemistic phrase bandied around to describe the country's industry, but Brian Rosen, CEO of Film Finance Corporation Australia (FFC), the government-backed film funding body, is more frank:  "I would term [it] a cottage industry in that it is very hand to mouth for most filmmakers. We are limited with the kind of stories we can tell," he told CNN over the phone from Sydney.  For big budget money, Australia relies on attracting Hollywood movies by competing with the United States on price.  In the early 2000s, huge productions like "The Matrix" trilogy (the first film to be shot at the Fox Studios complex outside Sydney) and the "Star Wars" prequels were filmed over a number of years.  While this was positive for the industry in terms of creating work, it hasn't succeed in putting identifiably Australian movies with bigger budgets onto the world stage.  More recently, big Hollywood bucks have dried up as the drop in value of the dollar has created incentives to stay at home.  But in the last two years, there have been some fundamental changes in the backing for films that give cause for hope in the industry.  One of Australia's most famous film exports, director Baz Luhrmann's latest film, "Australia" is at the heart of the changes.  Starring two of Australia's best-known Hollywood diasporaNicole Kidman and Hugh Jackmanit is billed as a sweeping Outback action-adventure romance.  It is the story of an English rose who inherits a cattle station and then has to enter into a pact with a stockman to prevent her property from being taken over.  With an estimated budget of $130 million, it is the most expensive film in the country's history. And it is the first Australian epic.  "The importance of that film is enormous. It's the first blockbuster that's identifiably Australian," Ian Robertson, head of the media division of Sydney-based lawyers Holding Redlich told Variety.  It's not just the size of the film or its subject matter. While preparing to shoot, the kitsch-loving filmmaker was instrumental in lobbying the Australian government to introduce a new incentive scheme that gives filmmakers a 40 percent rebate on the budget of their film.  This effectively allows Fox, the Hollywood studio behind "Australia," to take back over a third of the film's total budget.  The government and film officials hope that this new offset could be the catalyst for a turnaround in the industry's fortunes, increasing the production value of Aussie films from around $600 million (AUS) ($576 million) a year to $1 billion (AUS) ($960 million) over the next few years.  "We've made 'Crocodile Dundee' and 'Mad Max' and in the 90s we did 'Muriel's Wedding' and 'Strictly Ballroom' ... we need to be doing more of that, so what we're hoping with the offset is that we can move back up to doing 30 or 40 films a year. When you're only making 20 films a year it's hard to have any success," Rosen explained to CNN.  Foreign investment into Australian companies is being encouraged by testing productions for "Australian-ness."  To be eligible for the full 40 percent rebate, productions must pass a check that covers the film's subject matter, where it was made and the nationalities of the producer and director amongst others.  This way, the government hopes to start building the sustainable industry that has eluded them so far.  Aussie digital production company Animal Logic, the brains behind the 2007 hit "Happy Feet," is producing the latest film to benefit from the new rebate.  Animated feature "Guardians of Ga'Hoole," which is projected to come out in 2010, is based on the American series of children's books by Kathryn Lasky set in the imaginary "Forest of Tyto."  The film's makers say the forest is being designed to look like Tasmania and the majority of the cast is expected to be made up of Australian actors.  Despite the apparent Aussie credentials, this latest offset award is causing some controversy.  Critics say the film shouldn't be eligible because it has been in production by U.S. studio Warner Bros. since 2005.  Some Aussie filmmakers are wary of the rebate being abused by foreign filmmakers. If it becomes too popular it could attract negative attention from the new money-conscious government.  Nevertheless, exporting Australian culture is important to many in the country's film industry. Australian actor Kick Gurry, who recently starred in the Wachowski Brothers' latest film, "Speed Racer" told CNN: "If Australian [movies] can go well internationally and support artists at home it's really important to the cultural identity of a place."  The powers that be in Australian cinema certainly seem to be doing as much as they can to raise the industry's international profile and attract foreign filmmakers.  This year, the annual Sydney Film Festival launched a brand new official film competition.  New South Wales Minister Linda Burney was at Cannes Film Festival to make the announcement and told CNN: "Part of the reason for this announcement is to make it more attractive for international producers, international films ... to say to the international film community, 'We want your business.' We are saying to the rest of the world, 'Come to Sydney, come to our state, make films and we will look after you.'"  Brian Rosen hopes that more money will mean films with broader international appeal.  "We need to be making more ambitious films. I think we will be doing films with broader audience appeal which will have a much bigger success. So I see more "Happy Feet" happening," he said.  Aussiewood could be awakening from its slumber.  
 A man slips behind someone else into a packed elementary school with an AK-47-type weapon. He goes into the office and shoots at the ground, then darts between there and outside to fire at approaching police.  So what do you do?  If you're Antoinette Tuff, who works in the front office at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy just outside Atlanta, you don't run. You talk. You divulge your personal struggles to the gunman, you tell him you love him, you even proactively offer to walk outside with him to surrender so police won't shoot.  And then the nightmare ends with the suspect, later identified as Michael Brandon Hill, taken into custody and no one inside or outside the Decatur school even hurt, despite the gunfire.  "Let me tell you something, babe," Tuff tells the dispatcher, Kendra McCray, at the end of the dramatic 911 call that recounts her minutes of valor and terror. "I've never been so scared in all the days of my life. Oh, Jesus."  This brief outburst of emotion, moments after police entered the school Tuesday, was in stark contrast to her cool, calm demeanor as heard earlier on that 911 call.  As a go-between, she relayed his demands that police refrain from using their radios and "stop all movement," or else the suspect would shoot.  "He doesn't want the kids, he wants the police, so back off," she said in the call.  "What else, sir?  He said he don't care if he die, he don't have nothing to live for, and he said he's not mentally stable."  By the endwith police themselves having never directly talked to himTuff and the gunman were talking about where he would put his weapon, how he'd empty his pockets and where he'd lie down before authorities could get him.  "It's going to be all right, sweetie," she tells Hill at one point in the call.  "I just want you to know I love you, though, OK? And I'm proud of you. That's a good thing that you're just giving up and don't worry about it. We all go through something in life."  Tuff then let the gunman know that she'd been down before herself, but she'd picked herself up. He could, too.  "I thought the same thing, you know, I tried to commit suicide last year after my husband left me," she said. "But look at me now. I'm still working and everything is OK."  That day, for everyone at that school, everything did turn out OK. Shots were fired, but no one got hurt. The gunman never made it to the classroom area, deciding instead to give up and lay down.  This ending is thanks largely to Tuff, said McCray, the woman who fielded her 911 call. Echoing President Barack Obamawho called Tuff on Thursday to thank herand many others, McCray described Tuff as a "true hero" for being courageous, calm and personable.  "You did a great job," McCray said, shortly after the two met in person for the first time Thursday for an exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. "You made my job a lot easier."  Tuff, others 'thought it was a drill'  Tuff had training in how to deal with such a scenario.  School staff regularly train for dangerous situations involving trespassers and emergency protocol, school district spokesman Quinn Hudson said.  Tuff and two other staff membersa cafeteria manager and a media specialistwere specifically trained in hostile situations.  "The training is so often and extensive, they thought it was a drill" at first, said Hudson.  While Tuff worked to keep the gunman calm and spoke with him, she signaled a code to her two counterparts, who immediately triggered a phone tree to tell teachers to lock doors and send children to safety, Hudson said.  "Her name, Antoinette Tuff, says everything about her," said Brian Bolden, the school principal. "Tough. She has always been that way, from the first time I met her."  He describes her as a strong leader whose authority everyone respects.  The past eight years, Tuff has been with the Georgia schoolthe past three at McNair.  And she almost wasn't there Tuesday. Tuff was scheduled to be off that day, but because of a shift change, she ended up right where the school needed her to be.  The school's existing safety procedures will remain the same while the investigation takes place, Bolden said.  But he promised any needed changes will happen.  "We will do everything humanly possible in our power to keep this next generation of learners safe."  Counseling was made available to the kids, and the school understands that some children might not be ready to come back right away, he said.  Inside the suspect's mind  On Wednesday night, Hill, 20, was in a Georgia jail awaiting a still undetermined initial court appearance.  Authorities are still hammering out exactly what charges he will face. Police spokeswoman Mekka Parish has said they would include aggravated assault on a police officer, terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Ray Davis, the lead detective on the case, added that false imprisonment and "several weapons charges" probably will be included as well.  Whenever the charges come down, Hill will waive his initial court appearance, said Claudia Saari, public defender for the Stone Mountain Judicial Circuit. She said members of her office's mental health division are handling his case and  declined to make any further comment.  This week's incident is not Hill's first run-in with the law. He has a criminal history in DeKalb and neighboring Henry County that, while not "lengthy," does include violence, Davis said.  Specifically, Hill pleaded guilty in July to making "terroristic threats and acts" against his brother.  Georgia school shooting suspect was arrested in March  Henry County court records show that, in addition to three years of probation, he was ordered to attend anger management classes. But that county's district attorney, James Wright, said Wednesday that there's no indication that Hill completed them.  As to any connection to McNair Discovery Learning Academy, why he might have gone into it armed, and what he planned to do once there, authorities have not outlined a motive or a detailed plan.  Being from DeKalb County, Hill "possibly had been there (at the school) before speaking with some people in the administration," Davis said. But "there's no indication he had a grievance with the school."  Before he entered the school, the suspect took a picture of himself with the assault riflewhich he'd taken "from the house of an acquaintance," said Davis, who did not say whether the weapon was stolen.  So did Hill go in intent on killing people?  Davis responded: "I believe there was something else, but I don't want to go into detail."  Some clues about his mindset are evident in the dramatic 911 call.  With Tuff acting as the intermediary on the call, the suspect said that "he should have just went to the mental hospital instead of doing this, because he's not on his medication."  Chief: It 'absolutely' could have been 'another Sandy Hook'  While Tuff seemingly kept her cool inside the school, a swarm of law enforcement was springing into action outside.  Police reacted "very, very quickly"including some officers who took up positions with long rifles"to engage the threat" and prepare for the worst, said Alexander, the DeKalb County police chief.  "We can all make a reasonable assumption that he came there to do some harm," he said, recalling last year's school massacre in Connecticut that ended with 20 students, six adults and gunman Adam Lanza dead. "He entered a school, an elementary school with children in it ... to do one of two things: Either to do harm to those children and/or any first responders."  Thankfully, that didn't happen.  In fact, the suspect never went beyond the school's offices and never near its classrooms. While he fired some rounds at policeand one officer shot back at himno one was hit outside either.  And while there initially were fears that the suspect also had explosives, further tests indicated that was not the case: He came in with the rifle and a bag of ammunition, but no explosives.  Community members and leaders are offering praise for Tuff and police, as well as gratitude that the story did not turn tragic.  "Was the potential there to have another Sandy Hook? Absolutely," admits Alexander, the police chief.

First some full disclosure: Former President Jimmy Carter has been pretty good to me. He gave me in-person interviews for my last book and a forthcoming one on the end of greatness in the presidency. And every time we've met, our conversations have been friendly and productive.  But having worked on the Middle East negotiations for more than a few years and still laboring under the notion that wrongheaded assumptions and conclusions ought to be redressed, I can't help but weigh in on the former President's criticism of both President Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Carter's brief comments raise two important issues worth examining.  Carter's idea that the President ought to jump in and get in the middle of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and that Clinton should be somehow blamed for not taking on the peace process are dead-on inaccurate.  I've been critical of Obama and Clinton. But blasting them for failure to leap into the throes of a broken peace process isn't a valid criticism.  What Carter has done is to allow his own passion for resolving the Palestinian issue and his own experience in peacemaking during the late 1970s to skew his view of what is required now in the way of presidential involvement. Right now, the Kerry talks are hardly ready for prime time, and until they're much farther along Obama should keep his distance.  Carter's brief paragraph of comments in his longer interview in TIME takes shots at Obama and Clinton from two different directions. Other than his well-deserved expression of admiration for Kerry, just about everything in that paragraph is wrong.  First is the charge that Kerry is "having a difficult time operating pretty much on his own." Here's a news flash for you. This is the Israeli-Palestinian issueit's the mother of all migraine headaches and root canals operations.  Every secretary of state and president who has ever dealt with it has had a difficult time. Indeed, none has even come close to resolving it. Kerry is only the latest in a fairly long line of would-be peacemakers. And the fact is even with the current crisis in the talks, (likely to be resolved on the basis of more process but little peace) he's actually kept this thing afloat longer than anyone would have believed.  Implicit in Carter's charge, though, is the idea that Kerry's travails are related almost entirely to the fact that Obama has not played a central role in the enterprise so far.  Much of Carter's mediator addiction flows from his own experience in brokering Egyptian-Israeli peace. Let's be clear Jimmy Carter accomplished in 1978 and 1979 remains a truly important and consequential act of U.S. diplomacy.  Carter took risks in bringing Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to Camp David in 1978, and he was relentless and skillful in his brokering of those accords and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty that followed in March of the following year.  But presidential involvement then was both warranted and critical to the task at hand. Carter had two strong leaders who were serious about making a deal. He had a focus on Egyptian-Israeli peace that both Sadat (reluctantly) and Begin (happily) were prepared to separate out from the more complicated Palestinian issue. He had negotiators below the level of the two leaders on each side who were prepared to play key roles in facilitating, not complicating, the negotiations.  In short, then the peace process was ready for prime time. Now it isn't.  After all, Sadat in November 1977 in one of the most extraordinary acts of statesmanship in the 20th century had undertaken a trip to Jerusalem and in the process fundamentally altered the shape of the conflict.  Today, the Israeli-Palestinian issue remains largely frozen.  Should Kerry's effort progress further and the gaps on the core issues of the conflictborders, security, Jerusalem, refugeesnarrow significantly, it would be worth a significant push by Obama to close them.  Indeed, an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, let alone a conflict-ending one, isn't going to be possible without presidential involvement of a major caliber. But to spend presidential currency now, to make the President part of the political furniture by throwing him into a semihopeless process not only doesn't make sense, it would undermine presidential credibility.  Woody Allen was only partly right. Ninety percent of success in life is showing up. But it's showing up at the right time.  As for Carter's charge that Clinton "took very little action to bring about peace" and that "it was only Kerry's coming into office that reinitiated all these important and critical issues," that's also wrong and unfair.  During her term as secretary of state, Clinton dealt with perhaps the most controlling foreign policy president since Richard Nixon. Obama dominatedhe didn't delegate.  All of the consequential issues were run out of the White House, including the so-called peace process. And that had nary a chance of getting started because the President chose to focus on Israeli settlement activity instead of what might be required to reach an actual agreementnot that such an agreement could have been reached then anyway.  It was true that Clinton was likely risk-averse on the Palestinian issue. She was smart enough to know the climate was hardly amenable to an agreement.  It's also true Kerry is risk-ready. Unlike his predecessor, the arc of his prospective elected political career is descending; Clinton's is ascending. If she runs for president, she has to deal with the consequences of actions she took regarding the Middle East.  And so Kerry is prepared to be active. But that's because the President is ready to let Kerry engage. You have a second-term president more focused on the middle class as a legacy, not on the Middle East. And so it's important that he has a secretary of state who is prepared to take on and manage all the headaches the President can't or doesn't want to. It's truly unfair to blame Clinton for a first term peace process that never was and almost certainly never could have been.  Carter's views on the Middle East are likely driven by many things: his own success there and the lack of success of all of his predecessors on issues he cares deeply about and that are important to U.S. national interests. But none of that should fundamentally obscure the main issue.  Carter succeeded in the peace process because the parties themselves were prepared to own it and take the decisions necessary to make it work.  That is not yet the case today. The primary problem is not Barack Obama, John Kerry or Hillary Clinton.  It's primarily Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas. And while the United States has a critical role to play, unless that changes, you might as well hang a closed-for-the-season sign on prospects for a solution.  
 Another gruesome video. Another beheading of a Western captive by ISIS. And another family warned that its loved one may be next.  For Alan Henning's family, the nightmare has turned into reality. Now Abdul-Rahman Kassig's family is hoping for a miracle.  Both Henning and Kassig risked their lives to help strangers besieged by the Syrian civil war.  Over the weekend, hundreds of people attended a service in Manchester, England, to remember Henning. And Sunday night, Kassig's parents issued another plea for their son.  Here are the stories of the aid workers snatched by militants bent on using them as political pawns:  Henning: A 'national hero'  Not even the calls of 200 mosques in Britain were enough to stop radical militants from decapitating Henning, a 47-year-old taxi driver from near Manchester.  "Alan Henning was our local and national hero," a joint statement from the mosques said. "We will remember him as a tireless and selfless volunteer aid worker whose only concern was to help people in need."  The mosques also slammed the terror group who took him.  "The killing of Alan Henning was a cowardly and criminal act of appalling brutality by a group who do not represent Islam at all and in fact are an insult to the Islamic faith," their statement said.  Henning joined a group of volunteers who traveled to Syria in December 2013 to deliver food, water and medical supplies to people afflicted by the country's devastating civil war.  He was abducted by masked gunmen the day after Christmas, other people in the aid convoy said.  His wife, Barbara, pleaded for her husband's release, but to no avail.  ISIS released the video of Henning's decapitation on Friday. It said the killing was a response to the UK joining the U.S.-led bombing campaign against the group in Iraq and Syria.  Some of Henning's fellow aid workers believe the British Parliament's decision to authorize bombing ISIS in Iraq may have triggered their friend's slaughter.  "By joining the U.S. airstrikes, we handed Alan, and many other Western hostages, a death sentence," aid worker Dr. Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar said.  But British Prime Minister David Cameron said the "abhorrent" killing of Henning means allies must continue trying to "do everything we can to defeat this organization."  And as it did in the beheading videos of American freelance journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines, ISIS threatened to decapitate another Westerner. It showed American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig and said he would be next.  ISIS video similar to others, doesn't run as long  Kassig: 'I am an idealist'

The Tony Awards don't usually match the drama of the Oscars, but the 2014 edition at New York's Radio City Music Hall did deliver surprises and buzzworthy moments Sunday.  Bouncing Hugh Jackman  If you are baffled by Hugh Jackman's prolonged bouncing during the Tony Awards opening sequence, you might want to watch online video of musical actor Bobby Van performing "Take Me to Broadway" in the 1953 movie "Small Town Girl." You'll then understand what inspired Jackman to hop, skip and jump from the red carpet, through the backstage and then onstage where he sang "I Love the Tonys."  'Music Man' rap  Jackman must have spent a lot of time researching 1950s musicals while preparing to host the 2014 Tonys. He revived the opening number from "The Music Man," but turned it into a rap song. Hip-hop artists LL Cool J and T.I. joined Jackman for an unconventional performance of "Rock Island."  "Hands in the air, everybody on your feet," LL Cool J shouted as a drum beat produced by Questlove played.  "First Hip Hop performance on #thetonyawards w/@troubleman31 @thehughjackman," LL Cool J tweeted.  Judging from Twitter reactions, many viewers loved it, some didn't, while others were just left puzzled.  'Denzel, Denzel, Denzel'  A hint of sour grapes emerged from "A Raisin in the Sun" director Kenny Leon even though his show carried home three Tonys on Sunday night. Leon, who won for best direction of a play and best revival of a play, acknowledged backstage that he believed his lead actor, Denzel Washington, should have gotten a best actor nomination.  "Yes, Denzel was snubbed," Leon told reporters.  Washington, who owns two Academy Awards for film work, is the "anchor" of the Broadway production, Leon said in his acceptance speech. "Denzel, Denzel, Denzel. He's truly a theater inspiration."  Leon did find some solace when Sophie Okonedo, whom he called his show's "glue," was given the Tony for best actress in a featured role in a play.  "A Raisin in the Sun," which first ran on Broadway in 1960, was the first Broadway play written by an African-American womanLorraine Hansberry.  'All the Way' with LBJ  If Denzel Washington had been nominated, he would have faced Bryan Cranston. The "Breaking Bad" actor's ability to bring complex characters to life earned him a best actor Tony for his stage portrayal of former President Lyndon Johnson in "All the Way." The Tony might find a place of honor next to the three Emmys that Cranston won for his TV role of teacher-turned-meth dealer Walter White.  Cranston wouldn't say backstage if he would reprise his LBJ role in author Robert Schenkkan's follow-up play "The Great Society."  "Thank you for electing LBJ once again," producer Jeffrey Richards said as he accepted the best play Tony for "All the Way."  Tony history made  Audra McDonald made Broadway history when she won the Tony for best lead actress in a play for her portrayal of blues legend Billie Holiday in "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill." McDonald's sixth Tony made her the first person to win in four different acting categories.  "I want to thank my mom and my dad up in heaven for disobeying the doctor's orders and not medicating their hyperactive girl and finding out what she was into instead and pushing her into the theater," McDonald said in her acceptance speech.  She also paid tribute to women who paved the way for her success. "I'm standing on Lena Horne, I'm standing on Maya Angelou, Diahann Carroll, Ruby Dee and, most of all, Billie Holiday. You deserved so much more than you were given when you were on this planet. This is for you, Billie."  "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill"billed as "an evening filled with personal tales of difficult choices, bad breaks, worse men and some of the most glorious songs ever written"also won the Tony for best sound design of a play.  'This is crazy pants!'  What's a Tony Awards show without lots of Neil Patrick Harris? The actor who hosted the broadcast the previous four years got plenty of screen time Sunday night, including 90 seconds to accept the Tony for best actor in a leading role in a musical.  "A year ago I was hosting the Tonys," Harris said. "This is crazy pants!"  Harris was honored for his title role in "Hedwig and the Angry Inch," a musical about a rock band led by a German transgender singer.  Harris, who is known for his big musical numbers as a Tony host, did not disappoint when he performed a song from the show with the "Tits of Clay" band.  "Hedwig" also won for best revival of a musical, and Lena Hall got a Tony for best featured actress in a musical.  Hall's acceptance speech included a "thank you" to "my soon-to-be born niece. I don't know her name is yet but she'll be born in October."  Two Carole Kings  Jessie Mueller not only won a Tony for best lead actress in a musical, but she got to sing with the woman she portrays in "BeautifulThe Carole King Musical."  "Carole King, I never thought that I would get to sing with you once in my lifelet alone twice," Mueller said in her acceptance. "You have taught me so much and you teach me so much every time I get up on stage. What you went through and to come out of it with kindness and love and forgiveness and pure heart. And you're just such an amazing woman."  King joined Mueller for part of her performance as a young Carole King.  The show also won a Tony for best sound design of a musical, which went to Brian Ronan.  Thanks to Mom for skydiving lessons  The Tony for best musical went to "A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder," which also earned a best director Tony for Darko Tresnjak.  "I should thank so many people, but most of all, my mom literally taught me to jump out of airplanes," the director said in his acceptance speech. "She fought during the Second World War and she was a skydiver in 1940's." He then spoke for several seconds in his native Serbian language to his 87-year-old mother.  "A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder," which is based on the 1907 novel "Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal," also won Tonys for best costume design of a musical and best book of a musical.  Praise-shouting genie  James Monroe Iglehart might have earned the distinction of best acceptance speech dance. Iglehart, who sings and dances as the genie in "Aladdin," erupted in joy after he was handed the Tony for best performance by an actor in a featured role in a musical.  "I know this is supposed to be the most, you know, dignified awards show of the season, but I have to do this," he said. "This is a praise shout." He then shouted "hey" and danced.  Iglehart told reporters backstage that he and his wife would celebrate his Tony with dinner at McDonalds, saying it keeps them grounded.  
 Italian champions Inter Milan recorded their fifth straight win under new coach Leonardo, defeating Cesena 3-2 at the San Siro despite the visitors coming back from 2-0 down.  Samuel Eto'o gave the home side a 14th-minute lead when firing in his 24th goal of the season.  And, within a minute, Inter had doubled their advantage when Goran Pandev set up Diego Milito to tap home from just six yards out.  But Cesena refused to lie down and scored twice within six minutes in a frantic opening 45 minutes.  First, Erjon Bogdani was given far too much space to turn and shoot home low into the corner of the net in the 23rd minute.  Then, just six minutes later, Cesena remarkably drew level when former Inter midfielder Luis Suarez played the ball over the home defence for Emanuele Giaccherini to volley home.  But the first-half scoring was still not overand Romanian defender Christian Chivu put the home side ahead once again on the stroke of half time when he burst into the box to head home Maicon's cross.  That was the end of the scoring, but not the chances, and Eto'o should have added his second of the game after the break but somehow managed to hit the crossbar from just eight yards out.  And any chance Cesena had of getting back into the game was finally extinguished when Giaccherini was sent off for a second bookable offence.  The result moves Inter up to fourth place in the Serie A table, six points behind leaders and rivals AC Milan but with a game in hand.  Meanwhile, Roma are through to the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup after beating rivals Lazio 2-1 in a match marred by crowd trouble.  Roma took the lead eight minutes after the break when Marco Borriello scored from the penalty spot after Stephan Lichsteiner's handball in the area.  Lazio levelled just four minutes later when Hernanes also scored from the spot after Mauro Zarate had been fouled in the area.  However, Simplicio scored the winning goal 13 minutes from the end, firing home with a well-struck right-foot shot.  Police made four arrests before and after the match after trouble between rival fans which resulted in a teenage Lazio fan being taken to hospital with a knife wound to his leg.  Sampdoria have also reached the quarterfinals after defeating Udinese on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time.  The Genoa-based side scored all their five spot-kicks while Argentine striker German Denis missed his penalty as Udinese went out 5-4.

The remains of a Massachusetts airman missing in action from World War II have been identified and will be returned to his family for burial, the Department of Defense said Wednesday.  Army Air Forces 2nd Lt. Martin P. Murray, 21, of Lowell, Massachusetts, took off on October 27, 1943, from an airfield near Port Moresby, New Guinea, with 11 other crew members aboard a B-24D Liberator.  At the time, plans were being formulated to mount an attack on the Japanese fortification at Rabaul in Papua New Guinea's New Britain Province, the Defense Department's POW/Missing Personnel Office said in a statement. The crew was assigned to conduct reconnaissance on nearby shipping lanes in the Bismarck Sea.  During the mission, however, the crew was told to land at a friendly air strip nearby due to poor weather, officials said. "The last radio transmission from the crew did not indicate their location. Multiple search missions in the following weeks did not locate the aircraft."  After World War II, the Army Graves Registration Service searched for missing airmen, including Murray, in the area, but concluded in June 1949 all of them were unrecoverable, the department said.  In August 2003, a team from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command received information on a crash site from a citizen in Papua New Guinea while investigating another case, according to the statement. The citizen gave the team an identification card from one of the crew members and said there were possible human remains at the site.  Other teams attempted to visit the site twice in 2004, but were unable to because of poor weather and hazardous conditions at the helicopter landing site, authorities said. "Another team was able to successfully excavate the site from January to March 2007 where they found several identification tags from the B-24D crew as well as human remains."  Scientists from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command and the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory used forensic identification tools, circumstantial evidence, dental comparisons and mitochondrial DNA to identify Murray's remains, the statement said.  Murray's remains will be buried Saturday in Marshfield, Massachusetts, the Defense Department said.  At the end of World War II, the U.S. government was unable to recover and identify 79,000 Americans, the statement said. Now, that number has decreased to 74,000.  
 Manchester United fought back from two-goals down to defeat rivals Manchester City 3-2 in a thrilling Community Shield at Wembley, the traditional opener to the English Premier League.  Champions United and FA Cup winners City are expected to be challenging for the title come next Mayand both teams showed exceptional quality in an end-to-end encounter that thrilled the  77,000 crowd.  City had beaten their neighbors 1-0 when they last faced each other at Wembley, in April's FA Cup semifinal, and Roberto Mancini's big-spenders looked to be heading towards a similar result with two goals in the space of seven first-half minutes.  The opener came in the 38th minute when David Silva curled in a delightful free-kick from the right and defender Joleon Lescott rose above the United defence to head past debutant goalkeeper David De Gea.  And, on the stroke of half-time, City extended their advantage when Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko picked up the ball just inside the United half and was allowed to run unchallenged before firing a low 25-year shot that swerved away from De Gea.  But United manager Alex Ferguson made five changes for the second half and the result was that his team dominated the second 45 minutes.  Defender Chris Smalling reduced the deficit in the 52nd minute when side-footing home an Ashley Young free-kick.  And United drew level six minutes later with a stunning one-touch move that involved Wayne Rooney and Tom Cleverley that resulted in Nani flicking the ball over England goalkeeper Joe Hart.  Then, with the match heading towards a penalty shoot-out, United snatched victory with virtually the final kick.  A City attack, which ended with Dzeko missing a close-range header, resulted in United clearing the ball out of defence.  But, with seemingly no danger, City defenders Gael Clichy and Vincent Kompany displayed indecision, allowing Nani to rob the ball from Kompany's feet.  The Portuguese winger then ran unchallenged towards City's goal, before rounding Hart and sliding the ball into an empty net to secure United a dramatic last- gasp victory.  The result will give United a major boost ahead of next weekend's opening round of fixtureswill the last four Community Shield winners all going on to lift the Premier League title.

Texas slapped the U.S. Supreme Court in the face, and the justices just took it.  On Tuesday night,  Texas executed Marvin Wilson, whose IQ score was 61low enough that it should have met any standard for "diminished mental capacity." Shockingly, the court did not intervene to stop the execution despite its 2002 decision in Atkins v. Virginia barring the execution of the "mentally retarded" as "cruel and unusual punishment" in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Wilson played a role in the murder of Jerry Williams in 1992. He needed to be held accountable for his actions, even with diminished mental capacity. But he had the mental capacity of a first-grader, could barely match his socks and was fired from a car wash job for being too slow at drying cars. A clinical neuropsychologist with 22 years of experience concluded Wilson was intellectually disabled.  Texas got away with executing an intellectually disabled person because the Supreme Court allows states to determine their own standards of "mental retardation" and hasn't bothered to push back when states clearly ignore its ruling.  Flouting the heart of the Atkins decision, Texas decided that not all persons with "mental retardation" should be barred from execution, just those who "a consensus of Texas citizens would agree" whether they should live or die.  Unbelievably, Texas had cited the example of Lennie Small, the intellectually disabled ranch hand in John Steinbeck's famous novel written 75 years ago, "Of Mice and Men," to demonstrate this standard.  Steinbeck's son, Thomas Steinbeck, issued a statement before the execution: "I am certain that if my father, John Steinbeck, were here, he would be deeply angry and ashamed to see his work used in this way." He expressed shock that "Texas would use a fictional character ... as a benchmark to identify whether defendants with intellectual disability should live or die. I find the whole premise to be insulting, outrageous, ridiculous, and profoundly tragic."  The American Association on Intellectual and Development Disabilities was also disturbed by the lack of science and the reliance on "false stereotypes" in Texas' criteria.  In Georgia, prisoners are required to prove "beyond a reasonable doubt" that they are "mentally retarded." The state almost executed Warren Hill, a man clinically determined to be intellectually disabled. Fortunately, he received a stay of execution, though on other grounds. Clearly, some individuals who may not exhibit the most severe signs of disability will fall through the cracks.  Texas' standard leaves more than a crack through which the rare individual may slip. Wilson fell through a gaping hole because of the ridiculous criteria set by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Because the Texas Legislature failed to pass a law to catch up with the Atkins ruling, the state's high court stepped in.  The United States has not yet arrived at the position that governments should not have the irreversible God-like power to execute its citizens as the majority of countries in the world have. But 10 years ago, the Supreme Court at least recognized that there ought to be limits to this awful power.  The insane, children and those who are not mentally developed are more vulnerable than the rest of us. They are more easily manipulated, they are less capable of making sound judgments and they often need help carrying out basic daily functions. We treat them differently because we are humane and civilized, right?  The U.S. Supreme Court will receive more cases like the Wilson case until it stands up to the states and insists that they develop better scientific and reasonable criteria for judging a person's mental capacity that respect today's standards of decency.  The United States just sustained another black eye on the world stage when Texas was allowed to execute a man with the mind of 7-year-old. The egregiousness of this act is heightened for a country that claims the moral high ground and global leadership on human rights.  Executing a poor, African-American, intellectually disabled man shows once again the arbitrary nature of the death penalty. That was why the Supreme Court halted capital punishment 40 years ago in its Furman v. Georgia decision. In Gregg v. Georgia, the court allowed states to resume the death penalty after a four-year hiatus provided they reserve it for the "worst of the worst" offenders. Wilson hardly exemplifies this principle.  Amnesty International has documented several cases in recent years in which prisoners with compelling evidence of "mental retardation" were executed, and more than 100 cases where prisoners with severe mental illness were put to death. Again, the Supreme Court has failed to hold the states to a reasonable standard despite ruling that the "insane" (the legal term) must not be executed.  Capital punishment is an empty symbol and an outmoded practice. It is expensive, fails to keep us safe and diminishes us all.

 Move, Sony's new motion controller for the PlayStation 3, has been nearly everywhere in the days and weeks leading up to its official release September 19.  Gaming fans and critics alike have seen what the new device can do, how it will behave and even how it will affect their current and future gaming. But as complex and complicated as it seems, the Move had a very basic beginning.  To paraphrase Walt Disney, it all began with a ball.  At a demo event in Washington, the man behind the Move, Richard Marks, talked about how the motion controller came to be and where he hopes it will take gaming in the future.  As the manager of research and development for Sony, Marks said that work on the Move started after they developed the EyeToy camera for the PlayStation 2 and discovered they needed a ball to help it focus.  "Early work with the EyeToy camera got it to recognize specific shapes and colors to help it with tracking," Marks said. "We figured out that lighting is key to tracking."  Marks and his team found that the EyeToy, which is now a part of the Move system, was able to find and follow items that were sphere- or ball-shaped.  It's not surprising, then, that the hand controllers for the Move, which started showing up in online stores this week, are topped with colored balls that have led some to compare them to ice cream cones.  "The sphere looks the same no matter what angle you hold it," he said. "The camera then tracks the location by the size of the sphere. Bigger sphere means closer to the screen, while smaller means further away."  The development team used foam spheres with some success until a researcher wanted to make the spheres light up. It turned out that lighting the ball helped the EyeToy track the device even better.  "[The researcher] wanted the sphere to change colors to reflect different things in potential gameplay," Marks said. "What we found was that the camera worked better because the colored light in the ball makes it stand out from any background."  The Move and EyeToy actually examine the surroundings of a player for color pixels and then assign a completely different color to light up the sphere. The result is a smoother tracking of movement in three dimensions, something that a similar controller for another console can't do.  Once they got the camera to track a lighted, colored sphere reliably, how could they turn that into a game device?  Marks said that for his very first rudimentary Move controller, he took a regular controller for the PS3 and put the ball on one end.  "I cut the ends off because I wanted to make something that would feel good in one hand and had buttons to help with gameplay," he said. "It wasn't pretty."  The research-and-development team began to tweak the look and feel of the proto-Move controller, adding a gyroscope and accelerometer to assist with game movement.  Marks insisted that the new device keep the buttons from the PS3 controller because he said they are needed to do specific, in-game movements.  "You want to know you are having an effect in the game. Buttons give you instant feedback instead of just waving a hand to get something done," Marks said. "Not only can you quickly change from item to item using buttons, the T-button [an analog button located where your fingers wrap around the device] allows you to control how much of something you want to do. It gives the players more feedback and more freedom."  Marks envisions the Move controller as a device that will allow players the opportunity to explore 3-D environments and games in ways that previously were seen in science fiction movies.  He said the Move can pinpoint the position and angle of the player's hand in a way that's perfect for point-of-view games.  Although his team had a good controller in hand, it was too expensive in the beginning. Eventually, pricing of the components, specifically the gyro and accelerometer, came down. Marks said sensor technology also got better over time.  "We could have done something early, but it wouldn't have been as good," he explained.  And if one Move is good, two are better.  "Two Move controllers allow for more detail," Marks explained. "It opens up so many more possibilities for game developers to really put players in the middle of the action. There are a lot of things you can do as long as the platform is good."  He said first-person shooter games like "SOCOM" and individual sports games such as tennis, golf and archery will be the early success stories for the Move. But he's not counting out any game genre because, he said, developers are testing out the Move to find out what it can and can't do.  "I want new ways to show up to do things we haven't even thought of," Marks said. "The Move isn't going away any time soon."

(EW.com)When Lady Gaga flounces onto a concert stage in one of her Marie Antoinette-gone-"Clockwork Orange" getups, there's never much doubt that you're watching a glorious ''monster.'' The magic of Katy Perry, by contrast, is that she'll show up to perform in a shiny blue wig with Bettie Page bangs wearing oversize spinning lollipops pinned to her breasts ... and damned if she still doesn't look like the girl next door.  In the thrilling 3-D concert film "Katy Perry: Part of Me," there are a lot of things to love about Perry, from her sweetly sexy and pert beauty to her full-throated voice to the outrageous hookiness of songs like ''Teenage Dream'' and ''Last Friday Night'' (to me, her greatest track).  Yet you could talk about every one of those things without capturing what's most special about Perry: the joy that beams out of her like a holy light. "Part of Me" works hard to prove it's more than a glorified infomercial, and one reason it is more is that Perry has a startling story to tell. The daughter of Pentecostal ministers, she grew up in a Christian bubble, sheltered from pop. But once she embraced pop, she did so with an almost religious zeal.  The film also documents the breakup of her marriage to Russell Brand, and though it's glimpsed from the sidelines, Perry's despair is on full display. "Part of Me" demonstrates why feeling the sorrow may help to project the joy.  EW's grade: A-  See the full story at EW.com.

 Americans Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson won the Nobel Prize for economics for work on how community institutions can prevent conflict, the Nobel Committee announced Monday.  U.S. professors Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson are joint recipients of the Nobel Prize for economics.  Ostrom becomes the first woman to win the prize in its 40-year history.  The award was a "great surprise... I'm still a little bit in shock," she said by phone at the news conference announcing the prize.  Ostrom, a professor of political science at Indiana University, was praised "for her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons."  Ostrom's work shows that local communities often manage common resourcessuch as woods, lakes and fish stocksbetter on their own than when outside authorities impose rules, the committee said.  "Bureaucrats sometimes do not have the correct information, while citizens and users of resources do," she said to explain the significance of her work.  The committee highlighted her research on a dam in Nepal as an example, saying her research has moved analysis of nonmarket institutions "from the fringe of economic analysis to the very center."  Ostrom said she had not yet thought about what she would do with her half of the $1.4 million prize.  Williamson, a professor in the graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, was cited "for his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm."  Williamson's work examines why large corporations tend to ariseand why they do notbased on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee.  "He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict," the panel said.  Forbes magazine said, "He authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that challenged the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. He focused on the contracts and transactions that could explain the structure and boundaries of companies."  Williamson did not speak at the announcement ceremony.  "At some fundamental level, they are really both addressing the fundamental issue of how we create human cooperation through the design of appropriate institutions," committee member Tore Ellingsen said.  "They want to understand nonmarket institutions. ... Both laureates look at such institutions very much as conflict-resolution mechanisms," he said.  While the two professors' work has much in common at an "abstract level," their methods are different, Ellingsen said.  Ostrom works from case studies to derive general patterns, while Williamson uses theoretical reasoning.  The global financial crisis did not affect the committee's deliberations "that much," committee member Beril Holmlund said, noting that Nobel prizes "tend not to be for work done last year."  The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established in 1968 by the Central Bank of Sweden in memory of Alfred Nobel. It is given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which since 1901 has been awarding Nobel Prizes for achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and for peace.  CNN's Jo Shelley contributed to this report.

The White House has a big problem on its hands: finding someone to replace Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who was pushed out of the administration this week.  Since Michele Flournoy withdrew her name from consideration on Tuesday, there is a growing sense that many potential candidates may be shying away from the job due to the short time frame they would be in office and concerns over how independently they can function from the National Security Council, according to both current and former senior administration and congressional officials.  Flournoy cited family reasons for her decision to withdraw her name, but several administration officials say the decision came as a surprise because she had known she was on the short list of candidates being vetted. Another name now being widely circulated is former Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carterwho is widely credited with reforming cumbersome and expensive weapons acquisition procedures and programs, but who had clashed in the past with White House staff as well.  The scramble to find a new defense secretary comes as new details emerge over Hagel's departure from the administration. Hagel submitted his letter of resignation on Monday after it became apparent over a series of meetings with President Barack Obama that the president no longer wanted him in the job.  "Hagel didn't wait to be asked to leave," a senior administration official close to Hagel tells CNN.  Obama and Hagel had three conversations since late October, the last one being on Nov. 18.  "If you have three conversations with the President, you know where things stand", the official said.  After the final conversation, Hagel has a personal sense of "inevitability" he would resign, rather than wait to be fired, the official said, describing to CNN in detail the secretary's actions and thinking.  The official said Hagel rapidly came to the conclusion after that final meeting he "would not put up a fight," to keep his job, but would instead resign "giving the President options" to chart a different course. Hagel views his decision somewhat in military terms, when an officer submits his resignation knowing he will otherwise be fired.  The official said Hagel is "at peace" with his resignation and believes it was the honorable thing to do.  "He knew he wasn't wanted," the official said.  Hagel has been criticized for being a secretary who implements White House policy rather than being a dynamic member of a tight inner Obama circle offering new ideas and options. But this official strongly disputed portions of that characterization, saying "even John Kerry isn't a member of that circle," referring to the secretary of state.  While Hagel may not have regularly spoken up in large meetings, he did seek to be involved the official says. In September, he wrote a memo for Obama and the NSC to "make the case" that the administration needed to look for more "creative and active ways to deter Vladimir Putin," the official said.  Behind the scenes, Hagel had grown deeply frustrated by the decision making process at the NSC, which is universally described as "micromanagement." Hagel joins former defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates, who have also detailed NSC interference in both of their books and recent public appearances.  Hagel was also frustrated on several key issues where he had indeed offered specific views. He had wanted more immediate action on sending non lethal military aid to Ukraine, and also had written a memo calling for a clearer approach to US military and diplomatic action in Syria. The Pentagon was aware both memos had been poorly received at the National Security Council.  The official insisted that Hagel is fully supportive of the President's policy of not putting troops on the ground in Iraq in combat roles. If Obama pushed Hagel out because he is looking for a course correction on the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, it has not gotten to the point where Hagel or the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Martin Dempsey, have been asked for any new options.  OPINION: Pushing out Hagel not shake-up Obama needs  It now appears likely a confirmation hearing for Hagel's successor might not be scheduled before February, leaving a new Pentagon chief with less than two years on the job.  Several administration officials tell CNN the White House is also well aware any confirmation hearing could be a bruising fight given that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz) is taking over the Armed Services Committee and is a deep odds with the White House over Syria and Iraq.  That all adds up to a relatively short term in office likely that will almost certainly be characterized by fights with a Republican Congress on everything from the war against ISIS to potential mandatory spending cuts.  
 Washington Materials taken from Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan confirm that the al Qaeda leader communicated with the Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to a U.S. official familiar with the ongoing U.S. analysis of the documents.  It is not clear whether that group ever received the communications or if it acted upon them, said the official, who could not be named due to the sensitivity of the intelligence information.  The United States is still trying to determine if the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, American-born Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, was in direct communication with bin Laden. Washington considers the Yemen-based group a very active wing of al Qaeda. Several attempted bombing plots targeting the United Statesincluding the unsuccessful Times Square bombing of 2010 and the attempt to blow up courier planes with explosives hidden in printer cartridgeswere hatched in Yemen.  The search through bin Laden's materials, which were recovered after the al Qaeda leader was killed in a May 2 raid on his compound by U.S. Navy SEALs, has also found direct evidence that while in hiding in Pakistan, bin Laden was involved in planning attacks. The materials confirmed that bin Laden was encouraging direct plots to attack Americans and U.S. interests in Europe late last year, according to the U.S. official.  The source emphasized there were several threats at the time that led the United States to issue an October 2010 alert for Americans traveling in Europe.  Bin Laden was "aware, supportive and trying to motivate his operatives in Europe. He was pushing them," the source said.  What's next after bin Laden's death?  The U.S. intelligence community had classified information at the time suggesting that bin Laden was involved, the U.S. official said, but the documents taken from the compound have provided confirmation. Officials have previously said bin Laden always placed a top priority on trying to attack Americans.  While officials are still trying to assess overall how effective bin Laden was in communicating with his operatives in Pakistan and abroad, the threats that emerged late last year came from "al Qaeda Central," the source said, using the phrase that refers to bin Laden and his direct associates.  "Absolutely, he knew" about the plotting to attack in Europe, the official said. "Osama bin Laden was in the loop."

LONDON, England A six-month trial was launched this week that promises to transform the way luggage is tracked and monitored at London's Heathrow airport.  As many as 28 in every 1,000 passengers do not arrive at their destination at the same time as their luggage.  The trialrun by BAA and airline Emiratesis using RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology to tag baggage. This will allow staff to more accurately track bags passing through the airport.  The crucial difference between RFID and the existing barcode system is its scanning accuracy. Barcode tags can be easily damaged in transit and are also at risk of being covered when scanned. If not scanned, details must be entered manually into the system, adding time and error to the process.  BAA estimates that Heathrow can read only 60 per cent of labels that pass through. RFID is reported to offer over 99 percent accuracy.  The 150,000 trialthe first of its kind in the UKwill continue for six months tracking bags for passengers traveling with Emirates to and from Dubai, and transferring through Heathrow. A duplicate of the Heathrow system has been installed at Dubai Airport.  During the check-in process at Heathrow Terminal 3, staff apply tags containing RFID chips to bags with information including the passenger's name and route.  The chips are then read on entry into the baggage system; they are tracked as they move throughout; and finally on leaving the system. As a result, says Shaun Cowlam, Logistics Director at Heathrow Airport, staff can know where a bag is at "every moment of every day".  BAA is also considering introducing a SMS text messaging service to keep passengers informed of where their bags are. When passengers arrive at Heathrow, says Cowlam, the idea will be to send passengers a text informing them what belt and what time their bags will arrive at.  Ultimately, the use of RFID could extend services to frequent flyers, and provide the means to added value services such as faster check-in, and even be integrated with secure collection and delivery.  The main benefits, however, will be for travelers passing through major hubs such as Heathrow and Dubai, as this system offers better processing of baggage on transfer flights.  Emirates and BAA are sharing the costs of the trial. But as Vic Sheppard, Emirates Vice President for UK and Ireland says, "cost is not an issue", especially considering the savings the airline is expected to achieve by reducing loss and repatriation of bags.  And as Cowlam adds: "if we can introduce this across the whole network the costs will reduce significantly."  Hong Kong International Airport was one of the first to deploy RFID technology in 2005. But as outlined in a recent survey by SITA, RFID is being used in just 6 percent of the airports surveyed.  "For this system to really take off we need other airports and other airlines to embrace the technology," says Cowlam.  That widespread adoption may not be far off. The SITA survey indicated that RFID tags will be used in 45 percent of airports by the end of 2009.  It's still early days, but BAA and Emirates are optimistic for RFID's future in airports. "There have been giant strides in the technology in aviation in recent years. But in the last few decades there hasn't been any advancement in the methods adopted for baggage handling," says Sheppard. "This is a major step forward." E-mail to a friend  
 WASHINGTON A U.S. Navy submarine leaked trace amounts of radioactive water for two years as it made port calls in Japan and other Asian nations, the Navy said Thursday.  The USS Houston arrives in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for routine maintenance, during which the leak was found.  Last week, Navy officials told Japan that the USS Houston, a Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine, had made one port callin Marchwhile leaking the contaminated fluid.  But after reviewing records of the sub, the Navy told Japanese officials Thursday that the Houston had been leaking much longer, since June 2006, and had made port calls to Japanese bases at Sasebo, Yokosuka and Okinawa before the leak was discovered.  Officials also have told the governments of Malaysia and Singapore that the sub made port calls to those countries while leaking the radioactive water, Navy officials said. The Houston also made stops in Guam and Hawaii.  See a map of the submarine's travels   A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tokyo appreciated the United States reporting the new information promptly.  "At the same time, what remains to be nailed down is the cause," said the spokesman, Hiroshi Suzuki. "We still need to get to the bottom of the cause of this leak. We would like to get a full explanation."  Suzuki said the U.S. government has assured Japan it is taking all precautionary measures to guarantee safety. In addition, Japan also conducts round-the-clock monitoring of U.S. vessels in Japanese ports.  The U.S. Navy said Thursday that the leak was minor in both volume and radioactivity, and that the radioactivity from the leaks in all foreign ports added up to less than that found in a smoke detector.  The problem was discovered last month when a buildup of leaking water popped a covered valve and poured onto a sailor's leg while the submarine was in dry dock.  A subsequent investigation found a valve was slowly dripping water from within the nuclear power plant onboard, but it was not water that came in direct contact with the nuclear reactor, Navy officials said.  The water reportedly was so low in radiation it was barely detectable.  Officials with knowledge of the incident could not quantify the radiation level but insisted it was "negligible" and an "extremely low level." The total amount of radioactivity that leaked while the sub was in port in Guam, Japan and Hawaii was less than a half of a microcurie (0.0000005 curies), or less than what is found in a 50-pound bag of lawn and garden fertilizer, the officials said.  The sailor who was doused, a crew member of the Houston, tested negative for radiation from the water, according to Navy officials.  While Japan and the United States have come to agreements to allow nuclear-powered ships to make port calls in that country, the decision was a not a popular one in Japan.  The Houston incident comes at a time when the Navy is trying to smooth over another problem with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.  The USS George Washington was due to replace the aging, conventionally powered USS Kitty Hawk this summer as the sole U.S. carrier based in Japan.  While en route to Japan this May, a fire broke out on the George Washington, causing $70 million in damage. The fire was blamed on crew members smoking around improperly stored flammable materials.  There was no damage or threat to the nuclear reactor, but the ship was diverted to San Diego, California, for repairs. It is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of September.  The Navy fired the George Washington's captain and his deputy last week, saying an investigation into the fire led to a lack of confidence in the leadership of both men.  Three weeks ago, thousands of Japanese protested the pending arrival of the George Washington.  CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.

When Ann Arbor, Michigan, advertising executive Al McWilliams finished high school in the late 1990s, he made a vow.  He swore he would "never, ever again" commute to work by car, "no matter what I was doing in life."  Most of his teen friends were getting their first cars and feeling free, but McWilliams didn't see it like that.  For him, freedom was being able to spend three hours a day doing something other than driving to and from private school. Driving was "oppressive," and his VW GTI felt like a "ball and chain."  Flash-forward to the present. McWilliams, now 32, either walks or rides the bus to his office every day, making his way to the back of the Route 5 bus, where he'll find a window seat and maybe enjoy a nice book.  "I feel more free when I take the bus," McWilliams said. "I don't have to worry about a car, where it's parked, gas or maintenance." He's secure knowing that, just outside his door, "a bus is going to come by every 15 minutes and and take me where I want to go."  McWilliams represents a growing segment of America that has embraced public transit from coast to coast in communities like Seattle, Dallas, Nashville and Los Angeles.  And the numbers are bearing that out. Statistics released Monday from the American Public Transportation Association show that 2012 ranks as the second-highest transit ridership year since 1957. Only 2008 was higher.  Trips in 2012 on U.S. subways, commuter trains, light rail, trolleys and buses beat the previous year by 1.5%or about 154.3 million rides.  That despite damage from one of the worst East Coast storms in decades. Last fall, Superstorm Sandy shut down some of America's largest transit systems, resulting, according to the transportation association, in a loss of an estimated 74 million trips.  In Boston, the storm closed subways for several hours. The annual traffic increased 2.8% despite a 25% fare increase earlier in the year. Nationwide, ridership still increased.  What's going on here?  Well, several things, say experts. For one, the price of gas spiked north of $4 a gallon in 2008. That year, a lot of commuters who economized by using transit got a surprise: They liked it. They liked it because they could work on their laptops or phones. They could call friends, read books, chat with other commuters. Take naps.  It was all so much more enjoyable than crawling in rush-hour traffic on Washington's Beltway, Atlanta's Connector or even in Ann Arbor at the intersection of Washtenaw Avenue and Platt Road.  So they kept on riding, even as gas prices dropped.  Another reason: Cities that didn't have many public transportation options in the '80s and '90s have been getting on board.  Places like Salt Lake City and Phoenix, which fostered rail transit during the past decade, are now seeing community benefits like lower traffic congestion and increased economic activity.  The ballot box revealed another signal of support. Last year, voters approved nearly 80% of the nation's local and state transit funding initiatives, the American Public Transportation Association said, allowing their tax money to go toward public transportation systems.  Some of the winners in Monday's public transit report include:   New York City MTA subways, up 1.82%   Los Angeles MTA heavy rail, up 3.70%   Chicago elevated trains, up 4.32%   Ann Arbor, Michigan, buses, up 6.6%   Canton, Ohio, overall, up 9%   Lewisville, Texas (northwest of Dallas), overall up by 11%   Nashville, Tennessee, overall up 6.8%   Phoenix light rail, up 6.7%   Riverside, California, overall up 8%   Seattle, overall up 12%   Utah commuter rail up 14.74%; light rail up 14.73%  Cities that reported fewer trips included:   Washington Metro subway, down 3.2%   Atlanta MARTA subway/elevated rail, down 5.02%  Riders as customers  Less than 5 years old, Phoenix's light rail line gained nearly 7% in riders last year. Experts credit the increase to the train's convenient access to the city convention center, schools, shopping and nighttime entertainment.  "We look at riders as customers and try to design the experience from a customer's point of view," said Valley Metro's Susan Tierney. A special phone number offers riders real-time updates on arrival times. Managers are considering adding Wi-Fi to the trains.  Plans call for Phoenix light rail to expand to 57 miles by 2026 at the earliest, depending on the economy.  Linking up Utah  Utah's young rail system showed a nearly 15% gain on both its light rail and commuter rail lines in the Salt Lake City area. A commuter railroad linking the city with Provo opened in 2012, helping commuters avoid annoying vehicle traffic on I-15. Utah's light rail debuted in 2001 and commuter rail in 2008.  This year, two more light rail lines are expected to open for business.  Lawmakers are considering using public transit to battle the region's smog problem. A proposal would offer free access to light rail during January and July, Utah's worst months for smog.  Generations  And something else: The shift to embrace public transit appears to have a generational component. Younger people are waiting longer to get their driver's licenses, studies show. Many of these folks are using public transit.  Millennials, age 18 to 34, like McWilliams are more likely to use public transit than older Americans, according to surveys.  "Our parents moved to 'burbs where we grew up riding around in cars," McWilliams said. "My generation is going the other way. It may be as simple as that."  
 No doubt about it, actor Steven Yeun is in a pretty great place in his career.  He's on one of the most popular scripted series on cable, "The Walking Dead," and he's one of the most popular characters on that series.  On top of that, he is as close as one can get to being a romantic lead on a show about a zombie apocalypse. His character, Glenn, is involved with farmer's daughter Maggie, and they have the most stable relationship of all of the survivors at this point.  Of course, stabilitynot to mention life itselfis a very fragile thing on "The Walking Dead."  The third season, which began on Sunday to record ratings, sees the group settling in what at first appeared to be in an abandoned prison.  Yeun spoke with CNN about the new season, the fans and what scares him more than zombies.  CNN: Where is Glenn's head at this season?  Yeun: He sees himself as, if not a leader, at least a provider and protector and someone to look to in times of trouble. You see Glenn in this moment ready to take up the charge. It's not easy, but these are the moments he's been preparing for. We'll see how that plays out.  CNN: How devoted is he to Maggie now, as opposed to the rest of the group?  Yeun: I think Maggie is his strongest link. She's the sole thing he identifies with. I think she's the only thing that keeps him from going off on his own. I don't think he completely trusts the group.  You saw in the last season, he questioned Rick, someone he's always looked up to. Glenn saw that the only thing he can really trust is his own gut, and he needs to do that to protect the people he loves. Maggie is his sole connection to being in this world, even.  CNN: What new challenges come with the change of setting?  Yeun: It's an adjustment to get used to being on stages, not outside all the time. Luckily, our writers and producers make sure we had plenty of time in the battering heat. It was a challenge at first, but it's fun to play how the situation changes how the character behaves.  CNN: Is there anything for Glenn this season that tops that grotesque, harrowing scene in the well?  Yeun: This season is literally no holds barred; it's gas pedal down. I'm excited for people to see what's coming. It's just crazy. The well was an amazing thing. It was terrifying and fun. There's definitely stuff this season that tops that by far.  CNN: How does it feel to know about the season premiere's record-breaking ratings?  Yeun: It's pretty damn amazing. It's nice to know that people are anticipating it and telling their friends. It's all around great.  CNN: Are you into horror movies?  Yeun: I'm not much of a horror fan. When it comes to ghost stuff and demon stuff, I can't watch that. I've heard too many crazy stories about that stuff, so I don't mess around that. Especially when you're staying in a haunted hotel.  CNN: So zombies are no problem, but ghosts on the other hand ...  Yeun: Zombiesyou can deal with that. You can punch or shoot them. With ghosts, you're going to be possessed, or something's going to be thrown at you. You can't do anything about that. No, thank you!  CNN: Did you run into "Mythbusters' " Grant Imahara when he dressed up as Glenn at Dragon*Con this year?  Yeun: That's pretty amazing that he did that. It's amazing to see anyone do anything with that character. I'm just lucky enough to be able to play it in a public forum.  CNN: Have you had any unusual "zombie" interactions outside of the show?  Yeun: People are strange sometimes, which is completely hilarious to me. A really normal couple in Atlanta were walking down the street, and the girl recognized me and started walking towards me in a "walker" walk. And she was committed, like "Uuuuhh, I love your showwww ..." That was unique.  CNN: Finally, I have to ask, do you ever try to get information out of "Walking Dead" creator Robert Kirkman about what's going to happen on the show?  Yeun: They're pretty protective (of that). They hold on to things sometimes. We just don't ask, out of courtesy. And also, if you ask, you may put it on yourself.  CNN: Don't mess with the guy who could kill you off, huh?  Yeun: Exactly.

Washington The images couldn't have been better if Benjamin Netanyahu designed them himself.  After months of leveling humiliating criticism at the Israeli prime minister, here was President Obama calling Netanyahu a man of peace, speaking of the "unbreakable" bond between the United States and Israel and essentially giving Israel a green light to skirt transparency in its suspected nuclear program, citing its "unique security requirements."  Gone were the bitter recriminations and the harsh demands to stop all settlement activity in the West Bank. Instead there was praise for the Israeli government for "working through layers of various governmental entities and jurisdiction" and showing "restraint" over the past several months.  To put an even finer point on the fact that the recent tension was a thing of the past and the two leaders were once again bosom buddies (actually, they never were, but they seem to be now), Obama even walked Netanyahu to his car after the meeting.  The images were a marked contrast to Netanyahu's last visit in March. Then, there was no press conference or even a photo-op, and it was widely viewed as a snub after the Israeli announcement of new settlement plans for mostly Arab East Jerusalem during Vice President Joe Biden's visit to Israel.  The new message of unity made clear that the relationship between the United States and Israel, and that of their two leaders, was back on track.  It was the culmination of a new narrative months in the making. As he did with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Obama found his "tough love" approach toward Netanyahu was proving counterproductive. The U.S. push for a new United Nations Security Council resolution on Iran, Obama's recent signing of legislation imposing fresh U.S. sanctions against Tehran and his administration's efforts to push back pressure for an international investigation into the Gaza flotilla raid, which killed nine Turks, all helped to mend fences with Israel. Netanyahu's delegation left Washington satisfied that Obama understands Israel's security needs.  But beyond the change in tone evident for the cameras lies a series of contentious issues the United States and Israel will have to confront over the next several months. The details of what happens next are murky and could lead to renewed tensions in the fall when the 10-month freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank ends.  Both leaders agreed on the need to move from so-called "proximity talks," essentially consisting of shuttle diplomacy by Obama's Mideast envoy George Mitchell, to direct talks. But the conundrum is that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has refused to restart direct talks without a full settlement freeze, while Netanyahu is resisting extending the existing ban until talks start.  Obama set a deadline when he said talks should begin before the freeze ends in September, suggesting it could create a climate of trust building "in which everybody feels a greater investment in success."  The leaders also spoke of "confidence-building measures" both the Israelis and the Palestinians could take to create a better atmosphere for direct talks. Obama wants Israel to "widen the scope" of Palestinian security control in the West Bank beyond the current few cities, citing advances made by Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. But it is unclear Israel is confident enough to expand Palestinian responsibilities.  Obama went out on a limb Tuesday, saying unequivocally that he trusts Netanyahu. The assumption is that he must have gotten some assurances in private from Netanyahu about steps he is willing to take.  But it was clear from Netanyahu's remarks that the peace process isn't issue No. 1 for him. Obama administration officials before the meeting, and Obama himself during his press availability with Netanyahu, emphasized that moving to direct talks was the most important issue on the agenda. But in Netanyahu's remarks, the peace process rated a distant third to Iran and issues of Israel's security.  If direct talks don't begin soon, experts believe the possibility of a breakthrough becomes less likely. The Palestinians are almost certain to refuse to sit down if the settlement freeze is not extended. And as the U.S. midterm elections approach, Netanyahu could gamble on Republicans making gains and weakening Obama's hand. Netanyahu himself is facing domestic hurdles, which make playing for time in his best interests.  The hope is that Tuesday's summit enabled the leaders to build a partnership which can help them move forward on the peace process. The proof of that will come at the first bump on the rocky road to September, when daylight appears between these two new best friends.  
 London A mystery portrait donated to a British heritage charity as part of a mixed lot of paintings has been identified as a work by Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijnworth more than $30 million.  The picture, dated 1635, shows the then 29-year-old artist in a black velvet cape and hat decorated with outsized ostrich feathers. It was given to the National Trust in 2010, along with four other artworks.  At the time it was thought to have been painted by one of Rembrandt's pupils, but new tests and research by leading Rembrandt scholar Ernst van de Wetering have shown it is more likely to be by the teacher himself.  "Over the years, it has gone back and forward," David Taylor, the National Trust's curator of paintings and sculpture, told CNN. "Decades ago it was thought to be a Rembrandt, and then the experts said no, that it was by someone in his studio instead."  Van de Wetering, chairman of the Rembrandt Research Project, said the painting was last examined in 1968, and that in the intervening years "we have gathered far more knowledge about Rembrandt's self-portraits and the fluctuations in his style."  He said that X-ray analysis, along with "newly found circumstantial evidence remarkably increased the likelihood that the painting was by Rembrandt himself," and that a recent close look at the picture had confirmed those suspicions.  The painting was given to the Trust by the estate of Edna, Lady Samuel of Wych Cross, whose late husband Harold, Lord Samuel of Wych Cross was a keen art collector and philanthropist.  "It was part of a very generous gift, of five top-notch paintings," Taylor explained. As well as the Rembrandt portrait, the donation also included two peasant scenes and two maritime scenes.  But while the Trust recognized that the portrait was a high-quality work, it was not put on display at Buckland Abbey, in Devon, southwest England, immediately.  "It was in storage at first," explained Taylor. "Though not because it was unloved, more because we were waiting for the right place for itwe wanted to get the display right."  "It's amazing to think we might have had an actual Rembrandt hanging here on the walls at Buckland Abbey for the past couple of years," Jez McDermott, property manager at Buckland Abbey, said in a statement.  "We never dared think that it might actually be an original, and many of our visitors will have just passed by it, in what is sure to be a real contrast to the attention it is now going to receive."  The self-portrait, the only Rembrandt in the National Trust's huge collection of 13,500 paintings, will remain on display at Buckland Abbey until the end of the tourist seasonwhere it is expected to attract plenty of visitorsand will then be sent for further tests to help confirm its new identity.  "It will undergo a full clean, and technical analysis," said Taylor. "It is painted on a beech panel, so dendrochronology [tree ring dating] will allow us to date the panel, and it will be X-rayed to check for under-drawings.  "The paint will be analyzed, so we can see if the pigments match those used by Rembrandt, and when it comes back to us in the new year, we should have the final confirmation."

A 1-year-old girl who became seriously ill on a sailboat hundreds of miles off Mexico was on a U.S. Navy frigate Sunday and in stable condition, the U.S. Coast Guard said.  Her parents thanked those who played a part in their rescue.  "We are very thankful to be safe and well. We also appreciate all the concern, thoughts and prayers of everyone back home for the health of our daughter Lyra. She is doing well now, and her medical condition continues to improve," Eric and Charlotte Kaufman said in a statement.  They defended themselves against critics who question their decision to sail with their family.  "Please know that this is how our family has lived for seven years, and when we departed on this journey more than a year ago, we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any sailing crew could," they wrote.  "The ocean is one of the greatest forces of nature, and it always has the potential to overcome those who live on or near it.  "We are proud of our choices and our preparation, and while we are disappointed that we lost our sailboat and our home, we remain grateful for those who came to our aid and those family and friends who continue to encourage and support us."  On Thursday morning, the Coast Guard received a distress call about the girl, who was on the Rebel Hearta Hans Christian 36 boatwith her parents and sister about 900 miles from Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.  The sailboat did not have steering or communication abilities.  Members of an Air National Guard unit operating out of Moffett Federal Airfield in the San Francisco Bay Area were dispatched, according to a spokesman. Four members of the 129th Rescue Wing parachuted into the ocean, inflated a motorized boat and reached the 36-foot sailboat, said 2nd Lt. Roderick B. Bersamina.  The crew of the USS Vandegrift picked up the family and the four rescuers.  "Flight doctor says baby is stable after transfer; aircraft & air crews in Cabo are prepared,alert & evaluating all options," the 129th Rescue Wing wrote on its Twitter page Sunday.  Officials said they can't give details about the illness, but said "the family is in good spirits."  The family will stay aboard the Vandegrift as it sails back to San Diego.  They are expected to arrive either Wednesday or Thursday, according to 129th Rescue Wing Group Commander Col. Hernando Polo.  Maj. Mark Bomann said the baby is stable.  "We've been quite pleased with her status. The family is exhausted, as one can imagine, but they're out of any imminent danger or harm, which is what you'd worry about in a boat that may have problems," he told reporters.  According to their blogs, Eric Kaufman and his wife, Charlotte, had plans to cross the Pacific and left Mexico some two weeks ago with their daughters Cora, 3, and 1-year-old Lyra. The family lives in San Diego.  They left there in 2012 and were slowly making their way around the world. In one of her earlier blog posts, dated October 2012, Charlotte said that she and her husband had done a ton of research and would never purposefully put their family in harm's way. She wrote that they traveled with a satellite phone.  "Also remember that it is far, far more dangerous to drive every day on the freeway than it is to sail from San Diego to Mexico, or even around the world," Charlotte wrote.

 If you're a business traveler in Europe, you'll no doubt have complained at length about the regions' airlines, be it the cost of a plane ticket, the quality of the food or the delays. It's natural to feel hard done-by.  If it's any consolation, however, you're not the only one grumbling at the unfairness of it all. According to the IATA (International Air Transport Association)  2013 is expected to be another profitless year for the European airline industry. Tony Tyler, IATA's director general and CEO, argues that the industry is "balancing on a knife edge" with even the sturdiest and more established airlines feeling the pressure.  You only have to look at the profits forecast for the year to see how behind we really are. According to the Association of European Airlines, the sector is expected to lose $1.5 billion this year. U.S. carriers however, are expected to fare better and post profits totalling $3.4 billion.  Tyler argues this disparity is in part down to sluggish economic growth in Europe; crucially, however, it can also be impacted by what he calls "onerous" EU regulation and legislation. As an example, he cites delays: "There can be delays absolutely outside the control of the airline, but the airline still has to not only compensate the passenger but also to meet a whole lot of costs of those delays for passengers." The additional costs don't end there either: air traffic control costs are roughly double in Europe than they are in the United States.  The costs vary on land too. Europe's economic crisis has meant some governments have increased airport operating charges. In an opinion piece in Spain's El Pais, Tony Tyler argues that European airlines face "significant hurdles to sustained profitability, starting with the cost of airport and airways infrastructure." Spain's Madrid and Barcelona airports are a case in point: there, Tyler says, airlines have seen a 50% increase in charges.  Despite cutting legacy costs through mergers, consolidation and restructuring, European carriers are still facing the heavy hand of regulation and government, adds Tyler. "Just look at what's happening now in Spain with Iberia for example; very difficult to do the necessary restructuring in that environment".  Tyler is referring to battle between IAG (International Airlines Group) and the Spanish government. Whilst IAG's Chief Executive, Willie Walsh, wants to cut jobs and restructure the loss-making airline, the Spanish government is wary of a shrinking brand Iberia, which it argues is closely associated with 'brand Espaa'.  Speaking to me from Geneva, Tony Tyler called on governments to do more to help European carriers. He argues they can start by helping to control cost, by adding more runways, and repelling "some of the excessively onerous consumer protection regulation." In his words, to make Europe's airlines more competitive, government needs "to back off."  But in a time of great economic crisis in Europe, where each country is facing their own internal struggle, backing off may just be too painful for government.

There's big. And then there's bigger.  Introducing Triple Deuce, set to be the world's biggest superyacht at a whopping 222 meters (728 feet) long.  At $1 billion, it will also be the most expensive private yacht ever built, costing more than the annual GDP of Western Sahara, the British Virgin Islands, and Micronesia.  The identity of Triple Deuce's owner remains secret. Nonetheless, building a yacht of this size is all about "boasting rights," said Craig Timm of 4Yacht, broker of the record-breaking project.  "It's just like the competition to build the world's tallest building," he said of the commission, due to be completed in spring 2018.  "Project Deuce will cost $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion," added Timm. "And don't forget to add in annual operating costson a yacht of this size, it will run the owner up an additional $20 to $30 million per year."  The boat will be more than 131 feet (40 meters) longer than the world's current biggest superyacht, "Azzam," believed to be owned by the President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh  Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. It will also trump Russian businessman Roman Abramovich's "Eclipse" by 192 feet (58.5 meters).  "Our client was concerned that if we built the yacht to 200 meters (656 feet), then someone would come along like Roman Abramovich when he built Eclipse at 163.5 meters (536 feet), and outdid Sheikh Maktoum's yacht, the 162-meter (531-foot) Dubai, by only 1.5 meters (5 feet)," explained Timm.  "By building the yacht to 222 meters (728 feet), the owner wants to make it difficult, if not impossible, to be 'eclipsed' himself."  As the race to build the world's biggest superyacht steps up a notch, is there a point when these floating palaces simply become "too big?"  "You can't really be 'too big' for the high seas. But these superyachts are now at such a size that many of them can't get into harbors," said John Kampfner, author of "The Rich: From slaves to superyachts, a 2,000 year history."  "So what they do is moor out at sea, and a small boatwhich is still enormous by the standards of ordinary mortalswill take them to shore. Or they could always jump on their helicopter, because no self-respecting superyacht comes without a helipad these days."  In the past two decades average superyacht sizes have more than doubled, according to Gaelle Tallarida, managing director of the Monaco Yacht Show.  "Fifteen years ago a large yacht was 45 meters (147 feet)," she said. "Whereas now it's 100 meters (328 feet) long, maybe even a little more," she said.  "And I think we have still not achieved the limit."  Triple Deuce's master suite alone encompasses two stories and stretches across 275 square meters (275 square feet)including a private gym. The seven-deck superyacht also comes with two pools, numerous jacuzzi, and a hair stylist and barber.  Yet in a global climate of "haves and have-nots," is it morally justifiable to spend $1 billion on a private yacht catering for 36 guests?  "To be honest, what ordinary mortals think is 'moral,' is not actually relevant to these people," said Kampfner.  "You have to understand that we're not talking about the top 1%in this instance we're talking about the 0.01%. This is a tiny group who live in their own bubble, they mix only among themselves."  Timm sees things differently, pointing to the employment opportunities created during the building and running of the superyacht.  "The boat will take approximately two to three million human hours to buildnot counting all the worldwide subcontractor hours, or the ready-made items already available on the market ready to be installed on the yacht," he said.  "Building the yacht at the shipyard will directly employ, at the minimum, 500 people for a period of three years. These people, who have families to support and feed, will be gainfully employed.  "And this does not include the 50 to 70 people who will work on the yacht and will be employed full time by the yacht owner, as well as others who supply the yacht."  He extends this reasoning to the media"You, the journalist, benefits from this build indirectly by being gainfully employed by CNN for writing this story."  And you, the person reading this story? Kampfer sees the public's interest in the lifestyles of the super rich as a type of luxury porn.  "There is an enormous sense of injustice which is shared not just by the poor, but also by the middle class, towards the global super rich," he said.  "But together with that however, is a sense of envy and ogling. So whether you call it confusion, or double standards, or hypocrisy, or whatever it might bewe both abhor the lifestyles of the super rich and at the same time we are endlessly fascinated by them."

 There won't just be a new winner next season on "American Idol." Most everything about the show may be new.  Weeks after Randy Jackson announced his departure from Fox's long-running music talent show, two of his fellow judgesMariah Carey and Nicki Minajfollowed him out the door Thursday.  That leaves only one "Idol" judge left in crooner Keith Urbanfor now.  News of Carey's departure came out first Thursday, in the form of a tweet posted on her official account that stated she was saying "goodbye 2 idol" (and, simultaneously, announced a new world tour). Players behind "American Idol"namely Fox, FremantleMedia and 19 Entertainmentconfirmed her departure in a statement.  "Mariah Carey is a true global iconone of the most accomplished artists on the planetand we feel extremely fortunate that she was able to bring her wisdom and experience to the 'American Idol' contestants this season," they said. "We know she will remain an inspiration to 'Idol' hopefuls for many seasons to come."  Minaj followed up a short time later with a tweet of her own, making her exit official, also after a lone season.  "Thank you American Idol for a life changing experience! Wouldn't trade it for the world!" the rapper wrote. "Time to focus on the Music!!! Mmmuuuaahhh!!!"  After this tweet, Fox, FreemantleMedia and 19 Entertainment issued another statement saying they "understand and respect her decision" in light of "her extremely busy career."  "Nicki Minaj is a superstar who brought a level of honesty and passion to 'American Idol' and who had a tremendous positive impact on so many contestants this season," they said.  The two performers had been brought on following the exits of judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler, hoping to bolster the show's ratings.  "Idol" had topped the Nielsen charts as America's most watched program for eight years running. But that streak ended in 2012, and since then the show's producers have made several changes. This season's finale was earlier this month.  Carey and Minaj, though, ended up generating headlines more for their reported tiff than they did for bringing in more viewers.  Both of them join Jackson, who had been the only judge remaining from the program's 2002 debut. Earlier this month, he announced he had voted himself off the show.  "It's been a life-changing opportunity, but I am looking forward to focusing on my company, Dream Merchant 21, and other business ventures," the musician and producer said.

So Yeon Ryu was seven years old when she gave her first violin recital. She was in love with music, but at age 12 she had to make a tough decision.  "I started playing golf in elementary school. One day my golf coach took the team to a golf course and I fell in love with it. I loved walking the course and being out in nature," recalls Ryu, now 22.  She started to notice several professional golfers, like fellow South Korean Grace Park. "She was fashionable, powerful and beautiful," Ryu says.  Her golf was getting so much better that her mother asked what everyone had been thinking: "Do you want to become a violinist or a professional golfer?"  The moment of truth  "It was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make. I always wanted to become violinist," Ryu acknowledges.  By that time, she already had a role model: a girl who played on the elite U.S.-based LPGA Tour, and who, at age 20, became the first South Korean to claim a major title: Se Ri Pak.  "She is a great trailblazer for all Korean golfers. She played super great on the LPGA and because of that we could dream about playing on the world stage," Ryu says.  "But, this is not only her influence, we must be thankful to Grace Park, and Mi-Hyun Kim and other first generation Korean players on the LPGA."  With her mind solely on golf, Ryu informed her family about her decision to put the violin to one side, though her mother was not convinced.  "'Really? No violin?' My mom was so disappointed with my decision because everybody said I had a talent for music. I think my mom enjoyed choosing my recital dresses and having me perform on stage."  The transition  Waking up early for practice was one of the toughest things in Ryu's new life. Little by little she got used to it and during the transition she discovered that her musical background would be very helpful.  As a junior golfer, she had some trouble with her swing but her shots were good enough. "My swing tempo was consistently well and I think I got my good tempo from music," she says.  In 2006, at age 16, Ryu represented South Korea in the Asian Games in Qatar and won gold in the individual and team events.  Having impressed as an amateur, Ryu turned professional at the end of the following year and joined the KLPGA, the Korean women's tour.  She won her first tournament as a KLPGA member, triumphing by four strokes at the Sports Seoul Open in April 2008.  Her first winner's check brought her back to her first loveshe bought a violin for her sister, who had decided to pursue music as a career.  The 2009 season would be even better for Ryu. Aged just 19, she won five times, earned over $500,000 and finished second in the Player of the Year race.  But the real breakthrough came in 2011, at the most prestigious tournament in the female game: the U.S. Women's Open.  After a shaky opening round that put her six strokes off the pace, Ryu shot 69 on Friday and Saturday to share the lead going into the final day.  The tournament ended in a showdown between Ryu and her rival Hee Kyung Seowho had beaten her to the KLPGA player of the year award two years earlier.  This time it was Ryu who prevailed. She forced a playoff with a birdie on the last regulation green before, after three extra holes, becoming just the fifth South Korean to win the major.  A sixth, Na Yeon Choi, will defend her title at Sebonak Golf Club in Southampton, New York, this week.  Ryu emulated her hero Pakwho 13 years earlier became the first Korean to win itand, along with the winner's check of $585,000, it prompted her to make the next big step in her career.  "I transferred from the KLPGA to the LPGA and people started to recognize me," she says. "I moved to the U.S. and I am now based in California. That was a pretty big change, relocating to another country."  A keen student  Despite moving, Ryu continued studying physical education at Yonsei University, a private institution and the oldest of her country, and graduated in February this year with a bachelor's degree in sports management..  "I could not and would not trade my university life for anything. It was such a great time for me," she says.  "Sometimes I couldn't sleep during a tournament because of assignments. I had to wake up early if I wanted to practice before going to class. Physically, it was a hard job but it was worth it."  That work ethic goes some way to explaining the success of Korean women golfers and Ryu is now hoping that she can inspire new generations of young players like Pak and Kim did for her.  "I'd love to be someone's role model. I want to share my experience and heart," says the golfer, who finished second behind compatriot and close friend Inbee Park at this season's opening major, the Kraft-Nabisco Championship in April,.  "I would like to donate to poor people or junior golfers. I really want to support young golfers, not as an instructor but as a manager."  The best decision  Ryu's determination at age 12 has led her to become one of the best players in women's golf; she currently sits fifth in the Rolex world rankings, just behind Choi, while Park is No. 1 after also winning this month's LPGA Championship.  Last weekend the two friends battled for victory at the NW Arkansas Championship event, with Park beating Ryu in a playoff to claim her fifth win this season.  "Inbee and I practice together a lot so when we are standing at the 18th hole, it feels like just a practice round," Ryu told reporters. "I wasn't really nervous. Two players cannot be champion, so she deserved it."  Ryu was named 2012's LPGA Rookie of the Year, having won the 11th title of her pro career by a massive seven shots at the Jamie Farr Toldeo Classic.  Her love for music is still alive, and Ryu acknowledges that it "is too hard" to even think of trading her accomplishments in golf for a night as concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic or Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.  Her mother, who once was not satisfied with her daughter's decision, is now "so happy that I am a professional golfer."  And it was from her mom that she received the advice that has shaped her career: "Enjoy your life."  
 A strong storm over the Bering Seathe remnants of Super Typhoon Nuriwill bring intense winds, massive waves and heavy rain and snow to coastal Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.  But don't ignore it just because it is a sparsely populated area with residents who are accustomed to severe weather. The powerful storm will whip the jet stream, causing a ripple effect that will carry the cold air to the East Coast.  This arctic outbreak will funnel down through Canada over the next week, bringing a deep freeze to the eastern United States, with temperatures forecast 20 degrees below average.  The ripple of frigid air starts in Alaska, where the remnants of Super Typhoon Nuriwhich earlier in the week was tied for the strongest storm typhoon of the year based on wind speed have strengthened, though it isn't a typhoon any longer.  Technically, it's called a mid-latitude storm.  The storm carries the energy of the typhoon and its current strength is derived from clashes of hot and cold air. This incredibly strong cyclone will alter the jet stream allowing for the cold air to plunge into the United States next week.  The effects of the cold air will be felt as early as the weekend, as temperatures will cool in the East Coast. But a second cold front with really cold air will make its way into the Upper Midwest Sunday and the East Coast by the end of next week.  That second front will bring snow from Montana to the Great Lakes starting on Sunday. By Wednesday, snow may reach as far north as New England.  The name "Polar Vortex" has been attached in the past to weather like this, but that is a misnomer.  There is a thing called the Polar Vortex, and it is always present in the arctic atmosphere. The current storm is affecting the jet stream and allowing polar air to plunge farther south, but it is not a direct result of the Polar Vortex.

Lyon scored a late equalizer against Real Madrid to deny Karim Benzema a victorious return to his old club on Tuesday, while Chelsea moved towards a place in the Champions League quarterfinals with victory at Copenhagen.  Claude Puel's Lyon team are now unbeaten in seven encounters with Real in Europe's top club competition.  Nine-time European champions Real had lost in three previous visits to the Stade de Gerland, and last season were knocked out of the competition at the last-16 stage for the sixth year in a row after losing the first leg 1-0.  But this time, with Champions League-winning coach Jose Mourinho at the helm, the Spanish club have a better chance to end that poor run in next month's home leg after striker Benzema scored a vital away goal in France.  The 23-year-old, who has struggled to win a regular place since his $50 million signing in 2009, was named as a substitute despite netting in Saturday's La Liga win over Levante.  But he made an instant impact after replacing on-loan Togo forward Emmanuel Adebayor in the 64th minutewithin 60 seconds he burst into the area and poked a low shot over the line despite a desperate attempt to clear by Cris.  "At home, in the first leg, we would have preferred them not to score," Puel told reporters. "It's a bit of a shame, especially because we played a great first half."  However, Lyon captain Cris made a vital contribution to last season's semifinalists'  83rd-minute leveler when he rose highest to head a deflected free-kick into the path of France striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who calmly volleyed past goalkeeper Iker Casillas.  Gomis made amends for a poor first-half miss, having blazed a shot over the crossbar with the goal at his mercy in the 34th minute.  Real will be left to rue two efforts that hit the woodwork five minutes after the break.  First Cristiano Ronaldo smashed a free-kick against the far post following a booking to Lyon midfielder Michel Bastos that ruled the Brazilian out of the match at the Santiago Bernabeu on March 16.  Then defender Sergio Ramos, who had just narrowly missed glancing in Ronaldo's curled effort, headed against the crossbar from Mesut Ozil's corner.  "In the second half we managed to find spaces and, to begin with, we were closer to a second goal than Lyon were to an equalizer," Mourinho told reporters.  "But it sets things up well for the second leg, where we will hope to qualify in front of our supporters."  Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti dropped striker Didier Drogba for the trip to Denmark, meaning $80 million signing Fernando Torres returned after being ineligible for the English FA Cup defeat by Everton on Saturday.  But it was France forward Nicolas Anelka who stole the headlines with both goals in a 2-0 victory over Copenhagen, who were playing for the first time since December 5 due to the Danish winter break.  Anelka broke the deadlock in the 17th minute with an opportunist effort after a loose pass by former Chelsea player Jesper Gronkjaer from near the halfway line gave the 31-year-old space to surge forward and drill a low shot past goalkeeper Johan Wiland.  He was again on target nine minutes after the interval, firing his seventh goal of the competition this season from Frank Lampard's pass.  He made way for Drogba in the 74th minute, then almost immediately Torres had a shot cleared off the line as Chelsea went on to complete a first win since February 1 to lift some of the pressure on Ancelotti ahead of the second leg at Stamford Bridge.  Spain World Cup winner Torres is still looking for his first goal since leaving Liverpool three weeks ago and endured another frustrating night.  "He played very, very well," the Italian said. "The key to this game was the work the strikers did, always dangerous. Torres was unlucky he didn't score, but had a fantastic game."  Chelsea's chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League were boosted on Tuesday night when London rivals Tottenham suffered a 3-1 defeat at lowly Blackpool in the English Premier League.  Tottenham, who beat AC Milan in the Champions League last week, would have gone third above Manchester City with victory but instead remained two points clear of fifth-placed Chelseawho now have a game in hand.  Blackpool captain Charlie Adam, who almost joined Tottenham on the last day of the January transfer window, opened the scoring with an 18th-minute penalty and striker D.J. Campbell continued his scoring run with the second goal just before halftime.  Substitute Brett Ormerod made it 3-0 with 10 minutes to play, while Russia striker Roman Pavlyuchenko scored a consolation in time added on with a deflected long-range effort as he started in place of San Siro match-winner Peter Crouch.  The victory lifted Blackpool into 12th place, five points above the relegation zone.  Chelsea's aspirations face a big test next Tuesday at home to Premier League leaders Manchester United, who have a 12-point advantage over Ancelotti's defending champions and can extend that at Wigan on Saturday.  
 It's their fault, President Barack Obama said Monday in blaming Republican inaction on immigration reform for escalating problems including a surge of undocumented children crossing the border from Mexico.  At a hastily scheduled Rose Garden appearance, Obama said the top House RepublicanSpeaker John Boehnertold him last week that the chamber's GOP majority will continue blocking a vote on a Senate-passed immigration bill.  In response, Obama said he was starting "a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress."  Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder will "identify additional actions my administration can take within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can," the President said.  "If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours," he said, adding he expected the recommendations by the end of summer and would act on them without delay.  "The failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, is bad for our economy, is bad for our future," Obama said. "America cannot wait forever for them to act."  Vilify Republicans  Obama's statement sought to vilify Republicans for the failure to get congressional approval for immigration reform, an issue important to his base.  "Pass a bill. Solve a problem. Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done," he said, repeating his contention that a bill would win bipartisan approval if Boehner allowed it to come to a vote in the House.  The right fate for immigrant kids  Conservative Republicans oppose the Senate plan passed last year with support from both parties support because it includes a pathway to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the United States.  They also fear that such a reform measure would bolster already strong Democratic support among Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority.  For his part, Boehner said Monday that Republicans don't trust Obama to enforce laws they might pass.  "Until that changes, it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue," he said in a statement after Obama spoke. "The crisis at our southern border reminds us all of the critical importance of fixing our broken immigration system."  "Sad and disappointing"  He continued, "It is sad and disappointing thatfaced with this challengePresident Obama won't work with us, but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems."  Boehner noted that previous executive action by Obama to halt deportations of some undocumented children led to the current border crisis by "giving false hope to children and their families that if they enter the country illegally they will be allowed to stay."  In his statement, Obama announced he was ordering a shift in security resources to border regions, and he promised the additional action he can take "without Congress but within his existing authorities to fix as much of our broken immigration system as we can."  The President also sent Congress a letter asking that legislators work with him on providing additional money and leeway to deal with the situation on the southern border.  Border influx  On Sunday, an administration official told CNN the moneywhich could exceed $2 billionwould  go to securing appropriate space for the detention of children but also stemming the tide of immigrants.  The government hopes to increase its ability to investigate and dismantle smuggling organizations as well as quickly return children and adults to their home countries if they do not qualify for asylum, according to that official.  So far, the federal government has struggled to process and accommodate the influx of illegal human traffic but specifically the spike in children.  U.S. authorities estimate that between 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the White House is calling an "immediate humanitarian crisis."  Earlier in June, the White House announced a plan to spend millions in a government-wide response by sending aide to governments in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help with crime and violence prevention.  In mid-June, Vice President Joe Biden also spoke with leaders in the three countries as well as Mexico about working together to promote security.  Biden's objective was to emphasize that adults arriving with their children in the United States don't meet the requirements for a policy that defers deportation for children brought to the United States before June 15, 2012.  Obama also spoke with Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto about the issue and has warned families who see the dangerous trip as the best option for their children.

A day after violent protests erupted in the restive city of Daraa, security forces opened fire at protesters in the coastal city of Latakia, witnesses said.  Anti-government demonstrations in Latakia had started peacefully before several people were wounded in a hail of gunfire as security forces tightened their control on access to the city, witnesses said. However, presidential spokeswoman Bouthaina Shaaban told state media that an unidentified group of gunmen opened fire at citizens and security forces.  Although the group allegedly entered Latakia "breaking and burning shops," security forces did not return fire, Shaaban told SANA, the country's official news agency.  The gunmen killed two security force officers and one demonstrator, she said, blaming the clashes on those attempting to "meddle" in the security and stability of the country.  "The right to peaceful demonstration is guaranteed to any citizen in Syria," Shaaban said. "But what is happening is an attempt to ignite an internal strife in the country and to target the security and stability of the nation and the lives of its citizens."  CNN could not independently confirm the accounts as the Syrian government has yet to grant access to the country.  Meanwhile, in the southern city of Daraa where dozens of people were killed in violent clashes earlier this week, hundreds of Syrians demonstrated peacefully without security forces present, a witness said.  The protest also served as a funeral site for throngs of mourners to remember those who died in earlier demonstrations, the witness said.  Friday was marred with reports of casualties in the southern cities of Sanamen and Daraa where government security forces allegedly opened fire on protesters. In Daraa, dozens were shot in the head and neck and hundreds more were wounded on Friday when snipers on rooftops began firing into the crowd, according to a doctor in Daraa who declined to be named for security reasons.  The protesters, who were not carrying weapons, chanted, "We need our freedom, We need democracy," the doctor said.  In the neighboring city of Sanamen, at least 20 others were killed and more than 60 people wounded Friday after government security forces began shooting at demonstrators, the doctor in Daraa told CNN.  Thousands in Sanamen marched Saturday in what appeared to be a mixture of political protest and funeral procession as they sought to bury six people killed in violent clashes earlier in the week, another witness said.  Women chanted, "We will sacrifice our blood, our lives for you martyrs" as they walked, the witness said.  Presidential spokeswoman Shaaban again blamed "a group of gunmen and smugglers" who allegedly seized police weapons and began shooting. Their actions compelled security guards to fire back in defense of their post, she said.  Syrian state television later broadcast the apparent confessions of foreign nationals arrested in Syria, including an Egyptian with American citizenship who worked in Syria, according to SANA.  "The Egyptian man said he was receiving e-mails from external forces asking him to send pictures and video clips from Syria," the agency reported, noting that the man had recently vsited Israel through Jordan.  By Saturday, security forces had left the city, leaving Sanamen to the Syrian military. The army has since surrounded the city and restricted access to it.  Some residents are anticipating a food shortage as a result of what some describe as a blockade.  But chants of "Allah, Syria, and the Army only" seemed to indicate that at least some residents were encouraged by the army's presence, the witness said.  One soldier said "they would shoot themselves before they would shoot (the protesters)," the witness added.  Meanwhile, international concern over the escalating violence continued.  "The situation in Syria has worsened considerably over the past week, with the use of live ammunition and tear gas by the authorities having resulted in a total of at least 37 people being killed in Daraa, including two children," Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said Friday.  Among the dead were 15 people who tried to march to Daraa, sources said, and nine others who died when security forces fired on demonstrators in Daraa's main square, said Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist.  There were many casualties in Daraa, said Abdullah, who asked that his full name not be reported due to security concerns.  "Thousands gathered and moved to the governor's building in Daraa, and there they burned a large picture of Bashar al-Assad, and then they toppled a statue of Hafez al-Assad in the center of the square," Abdullah said, referring to the current president and his late father, the former president.  "After that, armed men came out from the roof of the officers' club in front of the governor's office and started firing at the crowd," he said.  Aman al Aswad, a political dissident, said dozens of people appeared to have been killed or wounded in clashes with security forces in the square, but he could not be precise on the totals.  Earlier Friday, thousands attended an anti-government demonstration in the town, according to Kamal Aswad, a political activist in Daraa.  There, people ridiculed recent government pronouncements of reforms and an assertion by government spokeswoman Shabaan that the country's president had ordered "no live bullets" would be used against demonstrators.  One witness said the people chanted, "Bouthaina, we do not want your bread, we want dignity!" He said an "overwhelming number" of protesters showed up in Daraa to support "martyrs," people killed in recent clashes.  "The whole of the city was out in the street to bury the dead and demand that those responsible be tried for their crimes against the people of Daraa," the witness said. "We broke the barrier of fear today and the security forces could not touch us."  The witness said the security forces had withdrawn from the center of the city and didn't interfere with the demonstrations, which are stoked by a range of political and economic grievances.  The government announced a number of measures that apparently addressed protesters' demands. Among them are decrees to cut taxes and raise government workers' salaries by 1,500 Syrian pounds ($32.60) a month and pledges to provide more press freedoms, increased job opportunities and curbs on government corruption.  The government said it will form a committee "to contact and listen to citizens in Daraa."  It also said it would study lifting the country's emergency law and adopting new legislation that would license political parties.  Syria's emergency law, which has been in effect since 1963, allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. It also bars detainees who haven't been charged from filing court complaints or from having a lawyer present during interrogations.  On Friday, state television showed what it said were pro-government demonstrations in Aleppo and Damascus. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said its correspondent in Daraa "reported that the crowds in the spontaneous popular rallies chanted national slogans highly lauding President Assad's generous decrees and decisions, pledging their loyalty to his excellency and their unity under his leadership in the face of any conspiracy against Syria."  However, video also emerged of protests in Hama, where the government violently suppressed an uprising in 1982.  And the state news agency reported that an armed gang attacked security forces in the southern city of Sanamen, which "resulted in the deaths of several attackers."  CNN's Saad Abedine and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report  
 Iran blasted its mock-up of a U.S. aircraft carrier during naval drills on Wednesday, swarming the target with 100 speedboats armed with rockets, shoulder-launched missiles and mortars as well as striking it with cruise missiles, according to reports from Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency.  Iran said the aircraft carrier target was a full-size replica of the USS Nimitz.  "Iranian naval forces displayed their skills in targeting enemy vessels and destroyed a mock U.S. aircraft carrier during the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy's massive Payambar-e Azam 9 (The Great Prophet 9) wargames in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz," read a video caption on Fars' website.  When U.S. officials first learned of the existence of the mock carrier last year, one described it as more akin to a Hollywood set than an actual warship.  But the symbolism is clear. Nimitz-class carriers are the centerpiece of U.S. naval forces, and the largest warships in the world.  Mine-laying exercises were also part of the war games, according to the Fars report.  Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi, commander of the Iranian naval forces, described that portion of the games as "the most important concern of the Americans."  "We have the most advanced sea mines which cannot be imagined by the Americans," he is quoted as saying in the Fars report.  Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami, lieutenant commander of the Revolutionary Guard, said Iran wasn't showing off all its capabilities during the games, according to a Fars report.  "We have capabilities which will remain covert and hidden before being used in action and we will merely use them in the battlefield," Salami said in the report.  A U.S. Navy spokesman in Bahrain told the Associated Press that the United States "was not concerned about this exercise."  "We're quite confident of our naval forces' ability to defend themselves," Cmdr. Kevin Stephens said.  In 2014: Iran says it built copy of captured U.S. drone

The grim stories of two women who endured long-stretches of solitary confinement in Iran's most notorious prison are chilling omens for the two jailed U.S. hikers who each reportedly received an eight-year prison sentence on Saturday.  Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer have been abused and assaulted in Evin Prison, their friend Sarah Shourd said in a BBC interview in June. Evin is noted for its harsh conditions and its wing for political prisoners.  "My worst fear is that they're not safe," said Shourd, who was arrested with Fattal and Bauer in July 2009 but was freed for medical reasons in September after 410 days of solitary confinement.  The two men were sentenced on charges of spying and illegal entry.  Shourd said a guard at Evin was furious that Fattal took extra food and pushed him down the stairs. The guard repeatedly threw BauerShourd's fianceagainst a wall of his cell until his head began bleeding.  She said the three had feared that they would be executed soon after they were arrested, when a guard began cocking his gun.  In July 2009, Shourd, Fattal, and Bauer were hiking in Iraq's autonomous Kurdish area along the border with Iran when they were arrested by Iranian police. Shourd said they accidentally strayed across the border. Iranian authorities say the three crossed into Iran illegally.  Twice, they feared for their lives as guards loaded them into a vehicle to a mysterious location and cocked their weapons, Shourd said. Terrified, they held hands, cried out and begged for their lives.  In September, Shourd spoke to CNN's "American Morning" about her stint at Evin, where she was in solitary confinement.  She said she got through the ordeal of imprisonment by thinking of her mother and loved ones and "just knowing I had to come back to them, you know, bruised but unbroken."  As she wept while prison guards slammed the door of her cell and walked away, Shourd understood what Fattal and Bauer were coping with.  "I can see them in their cramped little cell with very little sunlight and they only get out an hour a day and, you know, they exercise side by side on a space like the size of a towel."  Asked whether she was physically abused, she said no.  "It is all psychological. And it's just the hardest thing, of course, is being so alienated from your family."  She remembers how she begged to make a phone call, a request that was finally granted seven months into her captivity.  "By the time I got a phone call, I lost hope that it was going to happen," she told CNN.  "There's just so many ups and downs. You think it will be over and then it goes on and on and on."  American journalist Roxana Saberi also spent time in solitary confinement at Evin and spent hours thinking: Is it going to ever end?  "I felt anger toward God, as well. I said, 'Why are you punishing me? Why don't you save me?'" Saberi told CNN's "American Morning" in September.  She was sentenced to eight years in prison but was released after 100 days in May 2009. She said the ordeal was a hard one.  "When you're alone, you feel helpless. You might feel hopeless. At first you might be in a state of denial. You ask or tell yourself: 'I can't accept this. It is just a nightmare. It is going to end.'"  Saberi never knew whether she would be able to speak with her lawyer or when she might see her parents again.  She spent her 32nd birthday in jail, in the midst of a hunger strike. She chose to stop eating because her body was the only thing she could control. It was her only weapon against the regime. The Iranians promised her freedom if she would admit she was a spy. They threatened her to keep her silent about her time in Evin.  Saberi said she was threatened by her captors if she spoke about "certain things." One guard told her he would sign her death warrant.  She said they told her: "I think you've seen how capable we are. We have agents all over the world and we can find you anywhere. You might be reporting in Afghanistan and we can kill you and make it look like you died in a car accident."  
 When it comes to saving money on travel, we all know to check discount sites, follow our favorite airlines on social media and monitor our frequent flier points. But did you know that you can save big bucks just by opening your mouth? It turns out that some honest-to-goodness human-to-human interaction can help you win discounts on hotel, cruise and flight bookings.  We asked four travel expertsMatt Kepnes of NomadicMatt.com; George Hobica, founder of AirfareWatchdog.com; Jaime Freedman of Travelzoo.com; and Clem Bason, president of Hotwire.comfor simple questions every traveler should be asking to save money. Their answers, er, questions, are below.  7 gross wonders across America  Is there an upgrade available?  Though it may not be in our nature as Americans to haggle or barter for a deal, never feel too shy to request upgrades at airports and hotels.  "Just ask all the time," says Clem Bason, president of Hotwire.com. "Ninety-eight percent of people simply don't ask. The worst answer you'll get back is no."  Jaime Freedman of Travelzoo.com says, "I've seen instances where at the very last second they had business class available, so they offered it as an up-sell incredibly inexpensively."  Budget Travel: Top 10 most-visited cities in the world  George Hobica, founder of AirfareWatchdog.com, notes that airlines would rather up-sell you a seat in business or first class at a fraction of the cost than be forced to give away those expensive seats for free to members of loyalty programs. US Airways, for example, runs a last-minute program called GoUpgrades; beginning 24 hours before your flight, unsold first-class seats can be purchased for between $50 and $500 depending on the length of the flight.  When it comes to hotels, the same policy applies: Ask and you (may) receive. "Always say what you're celebrating," says Freedman. "Drop that it's your honeymoon, your birthday. You just never know what kind of little special things a hotel has in store."  If you have kids, she says, ask about a suite upgrade. And if you're a member of a hotel chain's loyalty program, Bason recommends asking for waived fees, free parking, kids' meals, breakfast or Wi-Fi.  Travel snapshots: Autumn color around the world  Has the price changed for my seat/room?  "Most people don't realize that there's a pretty good chance that a hotel booking is going to go down in price between the time you book it and the time you arrive," says AirfareWatchdog's George Hobica.  Hotel rooms and airline seats fluctuate in price, so once you've booked, it (literally) pays to check the price for a ticket or room every day until your vacation. If you see that the price has gone down, call the airline or hotel directly to see what they can do for you. In many cases, you may be able to cancel your reservation and rebook at a lower price.  According to a 2011 post by Hobica on AirfareWatchdog.com, airlines like JetBlue, Southwest and Alaska Airlines may offer you a travel voucher for the difference in price. Others, depending on policy, might simply allow you to cancel your flight and rebook at the lower rate. But buyer beware: Change fees can apply to rebooked flights, so be sure your discount is worth it.  Budget Travel: 10 places you'd rather be on a Wednesday  Are you running any local deals?  Being savvy with social media can obviously pay off when traveling. Restaurants, spas and museums may use local deal siteslike Groupon or LivingSocialto offer discounts on admission or services. It's always a good bet to sign up in advance for such websites to begin tracking where deals are occurring in your vacation destination.  "Go where the deal is," says Freedman. "More and more companies are starting [to offer local deals] as the competition increases."  Don't know where to start? Ask your friendly neighborhood concierge, says Bason. This especially applies at resort hotels, he says, where the concierge is likely to have or know about promotions and specials that might not be otherwise advertised. The added benefit is that you get to experience your destination like a local.  "When [deals] are sourced locally, it means you're going to places that aren't designed for tourists," says Freedman, and are consequently less expensive. Hey, why should locals have all the fun?  Budget Travel: 30 irresistible photos of fall  What's the resident rate?  What you don't know about booking a cruise can cost you. One hidden savings gem: the resident rate. You may be able to cruise for less if you're willing to depart from a port in your own state. And with ports of departure now in over a dozen states, you have a better chance than ever before of being able to leave from your home state. If you live reasonably near a cruise port, ask your agent about the rate for in-state residents, which Freedman says cruises offer at a deep discount to increase sales.  "It's wonderful when you can cruise from home. Basically you're going on a Caribbean vacation with no airfare." Freedman notes that while discounts for residents can vary, in-staters may be able to save up to 25 percent on a cruise.  In addition, when it comes to cruises, negotiate with your travel agent when you cruise, says Hobica. Agents are offered incentives from the cruise line and can pass that along to you. Don't be afraid to ask for perks like shipboard credits, which will help you save you on amenities.  Is there a tourism card available?  Matt Kepnes of NomadicMatt.com suggests always asking at the tourism office about a city pass. Popular destinations like Paris, London and New York offer passes that include admission to high-profile attractions. Some even include free public transportation or allow you to skip notoriously long lines at tourist hotspots.  New York City offers several varieties of passes that allow you to tailor your experience. The CityPass ($89 for adults, $64 for children) gets you admission to six main attractions including the Empire State Building Observatory, the American Museum of Natural History, the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island. You save 46 percent on combined admissionthat's $76 per adult!  Where are you going tonight?  Ok, that question may sound a little creepy. But don't let that stop you from asking tourism board or visitor center staffers for their own personal recommendationsnot where they send tourists, but where they go themselves. They'll know where to find the best off-the-beaten-path venues and cultural events, says Freedman, as well as which ones are running deals.  When it comes to sustenance, chances are they won't point you in the direction of expensive tourist traps. As Kepnes says, "You're not going to find New Yorkers eating in Times Square." Eating at local restaurants or buying at markets the locals use will save you a huge mark-up and give you a more authentic taste of the area.  What strategies do you use to trim costs on vacation?

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti  At least 50 people have died in a school collapse in in Petionville, near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, officials said Friday night.  Haitians try to help victims at a school that collapsed Friday in Petionville, near Port-au-Prince.  Rescue personnel planned to continue working into the night to dig out students and teachers buried in the rubble, the Red Cross said.  At least 100 people have been injured, the Haitian Civil Protection Bureau said. The death toll is expected to rise.  Officials said the school could have held as many as 700 people when the collapse occurred at 10 a.m. (10 a.m. ET) Some students were in class while others were in a playground, Haitian media reported.  "We are looking at major casualties here," Claudon said.  He said dozens of students appeared to be trapped inside but couldn't give an exact number. However, he said it was a typical school day and the building had been crowded.  Most of the students at the College La Promesse Evangelique range in age from 10 to 20, he said, but there are younger ones as well. Haitian press reports said the school has kindergarten, primary and secondary students.  President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis toured the disaster area.  "I heard and saw with my own eyes children appealing for help," Preval was quoted as saying on the French language www.haitipressnetwork.com.  "We are taking all necessary steps," Pierre-Louis said. " The government has mobilized to save those who can be saved."  Preval asked residents to stay away from the area so police and rescue officials could do their work unimpeded.  Michaele Gedeon, president of Haiti's Red Cross, said she heard the voices of distraught children as rescuers tried to calm them while she was on the phone attempting to coordinate emergency rescue efforts.  Watch as the Red Cross official describes the scene   "On the phone, you can hear so many children, you know, crying, crying and saying, 'this one is dead,' 'that one is dead,' " she said.  Claudon said hundreds of bystanders and rescue workers were digging through the rubble, but "what we need right now is heavy search-and-rescue equipment."  Claudon later said, "local authorities are doing their best."  Fifty to 60 patients, 30 of them severely injured, were taken to Trinite Hospital in Port-au-Prince, said Isabelle Mouniaman Nara, the head of mission in the capital for Medecins sans Frontieres.  Another 150 patients were treated elsewhere, Nara said Friday night.  The situation at Trinite "is under control right now," she said.  Trinite is the only hospital open in Port-au-Prince, the group said. The other two, General Hospital and Hospital de la Paix, are closed by strikes.  The school is in an extremely poor part of town, and the roads are nearly impassable, local journalist Clarens Renois said.  A United Nations helicopter was unable to land, Renois said.  "The school is poorly built," said Amelia Shaw, a journalist with United Nations TV who visited the scene.  Renois described the building as "not quite solid" with "weak construction."  The school consisted of two floors with an addition built in the rear over a 200-foot ravine, Shaw said. The steep hillside, she said, is covered with shanty-like housing on both sides.  The disaster occurred when the second floor crumbled onto the first, Shaw said.  A disaster assistance response team from the U.S. Agency for International Development arrived on the scene within hours of the collapse, the agency said in a release.  After assessing the situation, USAID activated its partner the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team. That team will be composed of 38 personnel, four search-and-rescue dogs and 31,000 pounds of rescue equipment and is expected to arrive Saturday.  The Urban Search and Rescue Team will be accompanied by four additional USAID disaster experts.  U.S. Ambassador Janet Sanderson expressed her condolences, haitipressnetwork.com reported.  
 Forty years after they were convicted by a jury of firebombing a grocery store in Wilmington, North Carolina, civil rights activists who became known as the "Wilmington 10" were pardoned Monday by the state's outgoing governor.  "These convictions were tainted by naked racism and represent an ugly stain on North Carolina's criminal justice system that cannot be allowed to stand any longer," said Gov. Beverly Perdue. "Justice demands that this stain finally be removed."  In 1972, nine black men and one white woman were convicted in the store firebombing in the coastal city despite their claims of innocence and their supporters' vehement argument that the defendants were victims of racially biased prosecutors.  Their sentences were reduced in 1978 by the state's governor then, Jim Hunt, and two years later their convictions were overturned in federal court for reasons of misconduct by the prosecutors.  But until Monday there were no pardons, and the sting of the guilty verdicts still followed the six surviving members of the group that was known nationwide as the Wilmington 10.  Perdue said that among the key evidence that led her to grant pardons of innocence were recently discovered notes from the prosecutor who picked the jury. The notes showed the prosecutor preferred white jurors who might be members of the Ku Klux Klan and one black juror was described as an "Uncle Tom type."  Perdue also pointed to the federal court's ruling that the prosecutor knew his star witness lied on the witness stand. That witness and other witnesses recanted a few years after the trial.  Timothy Tyson, a North Carolina historian and a visiting professor at Duke University, said he was given the notes two years ago and started to go through them recently when the NAACP called again for pardons for the Wilmington 10.  "It was pretty shocking stuff," he told CNN on Monday.  There were at least six potential jurors with "KKK Good!!" written next to them, he said. Next to a woman's name it said, "NO, she associates with Negroes."  On the back of the legal pad, the prosecutor, Jay Stroud, had apparently written the advantages and disadvantages of a mistrial, Tyson said. One of the advantages was a fresh start with a new jury.  Stroud told the Wilmington StarNews in October that the handwriting on the legal pad was his, but people were misinterpreting his notes.  "I could have had an all-white jury, but I didn't want to do that. Why would I leave a KKK on the jury?" Stroud said.  He told the newspaper that he wanted "blacks who could be fair" on the jury.  It was actually the second jury that ruled on the case. The first jury was dismissed after a mistrial was declared when Stroud said he was ill. That jury had two whites.  Tyson said the early 1970s were "really hard and really bad" and a "bubbling cauldron" of racially heated struggles in the state.  North Carolina had the largest number of Ku Klux Klan members in the country, he said, but there was also a strong African-American freedom movement.  "(The time) was seething with anger and resentment and fear and rage," he said.  And one of the Wilmington 10 was the Rev. Benjamin Chavis, whom Tyson described as a handsome, fearless civil rights leader who came from a brilliant family.  He was a threat to the "old guard" of North Carolina leaders.  Chavis was a target for police even before the firebombing occurred, Tyson said.  Chavis, who would become the head of the NAACP in 1993, was paroled in 1979.  Most of the others involved in the case struggled after they were set free.  "Things went badly for them," Tyson said. "Many of them had their health broken in prison."

Edith Windsor, who filed the original case that could upend the Defense of Marriage Act, says just getting the case to this point is a kind of victory.  "We've made a huge step forward and a huge difference in how people look at us," she said. "And so, it'll happen. Another year if not now."  It was the death of Windsor's life partner, Thea Clara Spyer, that led to the case.  Theirs was not a fleeting romancethe women were together 42 years sharing ups and downs, laughs and tears. They also shared what they'd earned together, including from Windsor's job as a programmer with IBM and Spyer's work as a psychologist.  5 things we learned from day one of oral arguments  "We were mildly affluent and extremely happy," Windsor said. "We were like most couples."  But even after they married in 2007 in Toronto, some 40 years into their courtship, the two women were not "like most couples" in the eyes of the state of New York, where they lived, nor in the eyes of the U.S. government, which under the Defense of Marriage Act mandates that a spouse, as legally defined, must be a person of the opposite sex.  This fact hit Windsor hard in 2009, while in a hospital after suffering a heart attack a month after Spyer's death. As she recovered and mourned, Windsor realized she faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes$363,053 more than was warranted, she later claimed in courtbecause Spyer was, in legal terms, little more than a friend.  "It was incredible indignation," Windsor recalled feeling. "Just the numbers were so cruel."  This anger gave way to action. Why, she and her lawyers argued, should her relationship with Spyer be any different when it came to rights, taxes and more than a heterosexual couple? Why should Windsor have to pay, literally, for losing her soulmateeven though, by 2009, New York courts had recognized that "foreign same-sex marriages" should be recognized in the state as valid?  In October, Windsor got an answer in the form of a ruling opinion from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That court found, in her favor, that the Defense of Marriage Act violates the Constitution's equal protection clause and thus she shouldn't have had to pay an inheritance tax after her partner's death. This follows a similar ruling, in May, from another federal appeals court in Boston.  Federal appeals court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act  Neither opinion settles the matter for good. That is expected to happen when the Supreme Court will weigh the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act through the prism of Windsor and Spyer's story. It is one of two cases related to same-sex marriage that the high court is considering. The other addresses California's Proposition 8. The court is expected to rule on both cases by mid-June.  Even with those cases pending, Windsor said last fallwhen the lower court decided in her favor, three years after Spyer's deaththat she felt she could finally breathe and celebrate.  It was a day she relished, and one she didn't entirely expect after all her heartache.  "What I'm feeling is elated," Windsor said. "Did I ever think it could come to be, altogether? ... Not a chance in hell."  By the numbers: Same-sex marriage  Instant chemistry in Greenwich Village  Born in Philadelphia in 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression, Windsor graduated from Temple University and earned a master's degree, in 1957, from New York University, according to a fall 2011 story in the latter school's alumni magazine.  She had come to New York hoping for a fresh start after a brief marriage, according to the report. And professionally, she found itworking for NYU's math department and soon entering data into its UNIVAC, one of a few dozen of the huge commercial computers then in operation. Her knack for programming eventually helped her land a job, and to excel, at IBM.  But something was missing in her life, personally.  Or, as Windsor put it more succinctly, "I suddenly couldn't take it anymore."  In the documentary "Edie and Thea: A Very Long Engagement," she recalled pleading with an old friend to take her "where the lesbians go." And so Windsor spent one Friday night at Portofino, a restaurant in New York's Greenwich Village.  "Somebody brought Thea over and introduced her. And we ended up dancing," she recalled.  "And we immediately just fit," added Spyer, on the documentary.  Timeline: Same-sex marriage  After reuniting two years later, according to their New York Times' wedding announcement, their connection proved deep and lasting. In 1967, Spyer proposed marriage with a round diamond pin. A year later, they purchased a house together in Southampton, according to the NYU Alumni Magazine story.  Yet while the gay rights' movement took off after the 1969 Stonewall Riots, which occurred while Windsor and Spyer were vacationing in Italy, an actual marriagea legal unionseemed out of the question.  Marriage, at last, and then heartache  Regardless, their love remained strong.  On the documentary, filmed around 2007, Spyer said, "Each one of us, in fact, looks different from how we looked when we met. But if I look at Edie now, she looks exactly the same to me. Exactly the same."  Windsor had halted her new career as a gay rights activist to help care for her partner, who suffered from multiple sclerosis. And it was after getting a "bad prognosis (that) I had another year to live and that was it" that Spyer proposed again.  "And I said yes," Windsor recalled. "She said, 'So do I.' "  Video shows Spyer being pushed through the airport in her wheelchair. It was from that seaton May 22, 2007, at Toronto's Sheraton Gateway Hotelthat she gave her vows to make their marriage official in Canada.  "I, Thea Spyer, choose you, Edith Windsor, to be my lawful, wedded spouse," she said. "For richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part."  Married same-sex couple awaits epic high court appeal  Having happily gone four decades without, Windsor soon realized how much the marriage meant to her. It made her and Spyer's love legitimate and all the more real.  "It's different because somewhere you're a hidden person, and suddenly you're a citizen of the world," she said in October of 2012.  But what happened as Spyer's condition worsened, and after her death, proved a stark reminder they were not legally united in their own country. And the fact that New York legalized same-sex marriage in 2011 didn't mean that Windsor, for example, would suddenly get back the hundreds of thousands of dollars in inheritance tax that she'd given to the government.  That could happen, however, if the Supreme Court upholds the appeals court ruling. That is Windsor's hope, as is that whether a committed couple is heterosexual or homosexual becomes irrelevant within the next decade.  In the meantime, Windsor said she's proud to fight for something bigger than herself and the legitimacy of her union with Spyer. She hopes, through her struggle, to help make it so gay teenagers can "fall in love knowing there's a future," that children of gay couples won't feel the need to explain their families, and that homophobia becomes a thing of the past.  "I feel like I'm representing them."  Couple fights for right to marry  
 Police in New Hampshire are searching for a missing mother after her baby daughter was discovered in an abandoned car with its engine running and hazard lights flashing, authorities said.  Krista Dittmeyer, 20, has not been seen since Saturday, when the 14-month-old was found alone in her car, parked in the parking lot of a ski area at Mount Cranmore, New Hampshire, according to Conway, New Hampshire, police spokesman Christopher Perley.  The car was discovered early Saturday morning by an unidentified passerby who noticed the flashing hazard lights. When the witness "approached the car, they found that it was unoccupied, it was running, the driver's door was slightly ajar and there was a baby in the back seat," Perley told reporters Monday.  The witness alerted police and the baby was taken to nearby Memorial Hospital, where it was determined to be in good health and then reunited with its grandmother, Perley said. Police also conducted a thorough search using fire and rescue personnel, New Hampshire Fish and Game staffers and police dogs. A murky pond has been drained and an air search was conducted Monday with no sign of Dittmeyer, Perley said.  "We don't have any information that leads us to believe that she's not alive, and we're going to continue to investigate as if we can reunite her with her family," Perley said in a Monday press conference.  Dittmeyer, who lived with roommates in Portland, Maine, had no history of mental illness and no criminal record, Perley said.  "She would never, ever, ever, leave her in a car by herself," Dittmeyer's friend Kathy Pratt told CNN affiliate WMUR, referring to Dittmeyer's daughter.  Dittmeyer, who last spoke with her family at 8 p.m. on Friday, has friends in the North Conway area.  "We know that she would do whatever it takes to get back here and be with her daughter," her sister, Kayla Dittmeyer, told WMUR.  Police are testing physical evidence found at the scene, along with two vehiclesone of them Krista Dittmeyer's black Nissan Sentra, Perley said in the press conference.  Authorities are also executing multiple search warrants and applying for a warrant for Dittmeyer's cell phone records, he said.  "We are mobilizing every resource that we have and we are continuing to mobilize additional sources to reunite Krista with her family," Perley said.

Last night, a video emerged of the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff, at the hands of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's ISIS, the extreme jihadist group that has illegitimately declared the establishment of a militant "caliphate" in Syria and Iraq.  This latest execution video follows that of a similar crime committed against another U.S. journalist, James Foley, a fortnight ago. Like the first "Message to America," this latest video ended with the executioner threatening to behead another captive non-combatant, this time a Briton.  First and foremost, it is imperative that we do not allow the traction that these videos have gained in the West to eclipse ISIS's other inhumane actions.  In years gone by, ISISwhich refers to itself as the Islamic Stateand its forebears have consistently and persistently committed the most atrocious of war crimes against communities in the Middle East.  In the last month alone, it has been held responsible for attempting a genocide against the Yazidi minority sect, as well as the extermination of the Turkmen Shia Muslims of Amerli.  These come on top of the wholesale massacre it committed against the Sunni peoples of the Shu'aytat tribe in East Syria in August, as well as countless other summary executions of people it deems to be its enemies.  We must not be fooled into thinking that ISIS only beheads its Western captives; last week, a Kurdish man - unarmed, of course - was executed in front of a mosque in Mosul in a video entitled "A message written in blood." But because it was directed at the president of Iraqi Kurdistan, this particular piece of propaganda did not receive widespread coverage in the international media.  A cursory glance at ISIS propaganda suggests that the West is its primary target. While this may be the case in terms of the group's long-term ambitions, events on the ground in Syria and Iraq paint a very different picture, with ISIS predominantly killing those it deems to be "apostate", including its co-religionists.  In light of events in Syria and Iraq, the international community must react robustly and swiftly. This week's NATO summit is fortuitously timed, and one would hope that the ISIS crisis takes its place at the top of the meeting's agenda.  However, as I've said before, a strategy of solely Western intervention would play right into the ISIS ideology. Indeed, it would be exactly what the group wants. As such, it is paramount that other statesparticularly those within the regionstep up to the plate as well. Countries such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia must actively respond instead of leaving it to others.  It is not just the international community that has a responsibility, though: the media must act as well. It is paramount that it carefully considers its treatment of ISIS propaganda, with its twin aims of intimidation and recruitment.  Every time a still or clip from an ISIS video is shown, the group gets what it wants: the oxygen of publicity. Of course, it is necessary that people the world over are aware of the atrocities occurring at the hands of ISIS, but journalists must be careful not to do the jihadists' job for them.  This also involves establishing a firm no-platform policy for al-Baghadi's stooges in the West. These insidious individuals thrive on media attention, which they use to amplify their otherwise ostracized voices.  As Quilliam's last report, which looked at extremist content online, showed, it is an unfortunate truth that online censorship does not work.  Any attempts at censorship in the aftermath of the Foley killing were always doomed to failure. Simply put, corporations and governments are unable to remove propaganda from the internet at the rate that it is uploaded. More effective than government-led censorship was the "ISIS media blackout," in which users across the internet resolutely refused to publicize ISIS material. After all, videos like these have minimal propaganda value if they have no audience.  At the same time, instead of publicizing what ISIS wants, we must popularize what it doesn't.  The anti-ISIS fatwa recently released by prominent Sunni British imams would be a good place to start, because it dismantles any sense of legitimacy for the self-proclaimed "caliphate" and directly calls for Muslim communities to take an active stance in opposing this appalling group.  More initiatives like this must emerge. That they have not materialized already is testament an untenable situation in which the vast majority of Muslims, who are invariably moderate, are largely silent, something which leaves extremists to dominate the discourse on Islam.  The time has passed when we can allow ISIS to popularize itself unchallenged. Challenging ISIS propaganda must be at the forefront of international policy towards Syria and Iraq. And it is not just something for governments to deal with. People all over the world, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, are responsible too.  
 "Sehwag, go back to Ranji!" The jingoistic crowd was screaming when the portly batsman Virender Sehwag was dismissed in the game between the Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Daredevils in an Indian Premier League (IPL) semi-final game in 2008.  That Sehwag was one of India's leading players of the decade apparently didn't matter. The spectators were delivering their ultimate insult: Telling him to go back to the staid version of the Indian domestic circuit, the Ranji Trophy.  The crowd IPL attracted was different from the traditional Anglophile test cricket fan. They were raucous, participative and young. They were happy to see legends succeed, and happier to see them fail if they played for rival teams. The fans were unitedand partisan.  Six years after that inaugural edition, the world's top cricket players have once again been put up for sale in the annual IPL auction. The auction is the televised sale of cricket players to IPL franchises through an open bidding process. This year's auction is marked by rule changes which "nudge" teams into buying players from other teams rather than retain existing squads.  The league has exploded into a brand estimated to be worth more than $3 billion, negotiating huge deals with TV and sponsors and getting the force of India's huge fan base behind it.  The IPL's rapid rise has not been without hiccups. As the auction gets under way a high profile report on match fixing suggests a deep rot in Indian cricket overall and the IPL in particular.  But, as fans debate whether even average players should be paid more than 200 times the average Indian's annual income for less than 20 hours of "real" work, it is worth considering how the IPL became such a force in world sport. To do that, we need to step back more than 160 years.  In 1850, cricket was much bigger than baseball in parts of the United States. Newspapers in New York and Philadelphia reported cricket more often than baseball.  The moment was right for a great England-U.S. cricketing rivalry, but cricket then was run with a more imperial mind-set, and Britain's colonies and dominions such as Australia, New Zealand and the West Indies were more compliant territories to establish the game.  Then AG Spalding, a leading baseball pitcher of the 1870s, spotted the gap in the U.S. market for a people's ball game. He positioned baseball as a "made in America" game. In doing so, he relegated cricket into a colonial relic and launched a sporting empire.  And so, for decades, America snubbed cricket. Then, just a few years ago, the sport started morphing into something distinctly American.  In 2006 Andrew Wildblood, from sports marketing group IMG, and Lalit Modi, a scion of the Godfrey Philips cigarette empire, realized that the game of test cricket had one problem: length. To be precise, five days in the sun. Even the one-day game lasts more than six hours, which is about three times the attention span of young India.  Modi and Wildblood would have known that a shorter game would attract more fans, and began developing a proposal based on this.  The shorter, Twenty20 structure had already being trialled successfully around the world. Each side would get only twenty overs or 120 legitimate deliveries to play. However the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI), the world's biggest cricket "market," resisted the new format.  But Modi understood that eyeballs, not duration of game, would determine advertising revenue. He then single-handedly took an English game and single-mindedly Americanized it for a new India.  Modi, a U.S. college graduate, understood the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball, and applied his insights to the new project. This led to his meteoric rise in Indian cricket in the hierarchy, followed by a fall from grace. But how did he overcome resistance from BCCI?  It was set on its path to success in 2007, when media house Zee Entertainment Enterprises launched a rival Twenty20 league, called the Indian Cricket League. This forced BCCI into the arms of Modi as they tried to compete.  Other factors played also into the IPL's success, including timing. The league was launched just after a rookie Indian team unexpectedly won the World Twenty20 Cup in 2007 in South Africa. The younger generation of fans could relate to this game and to the new stars easily.  Modi's IPL business model was conceived using the proven American sports franchise model. The tactics included copying the NFL Draft with the IPL auction, cheerleaders and plenty of timeouts for advertising. Like the Superbowl, Modi embraced showbiz. Katy Perry performed at one of the opening ceremonies.  To this "Made in America" mix, Modi added Bollywood. For years, cinema and cricket had been the principal forms of escapism for Indians. By having film stars involved in the league either as owners or ambassadors, the IPL was to provide a double dose of escapism at one shot.  In another savvy move, star players were allocated to specific franchises, ensuring they were identifiably "Indian," while international cricketers created a global feel. Franchisee owners were in ferocious competition, leading to a disproportionate investment in players and marketing.  Finally, there was luck. In the inaugural game, New Zealander Brendon McCullum played one of the greatest Twenty20 innings, and the nation was hooked.  The IPL energized cricket in India. It is unabashedly capitalist, has brought a new generation of fans to the game and brought financial windfalls to players. However, like an unregulated banking industry, it is now in a race against its own inability to set and implement ground rules on ethics, codes of conduct and self-discipline.  Whether it will be remembered as cricket's greatest party or its biggest hangover will depend on how fast the administrators can convince fans and media that the games they are watching are clean.  Meanwhile, as the IPL franchises compete in an open market for players this week, it is also time to reflect whether the auction is confirmation that cricket's soul is now no longer English but American.

Laura Bush is suggesting she, her husband and several aides were poisoned during a 2007 visit to Germany for the G8 summit, one of several new details in the former first lady's forthcoming memoir, "Spoken From the Heart."  Due to hit bookshelves May 4 but purchased by CNN at a Washington-area bookstore, Mrs. Bush says she and former President George W. Bush became mysteriously sick on the Germany trip to such a degree that the president became bedridden.  According to Mrs. Bush, doctors and the Secret Service investigated the possibility a poisoning had occurred but were unable to make a definitive conclusion.  News reports filed during the event show the White House did disclose Bush missed a series of morning sessions at the summit because he had contracted an apparent virus, but White House officials did not provide further details at that time.  Townsend: Bush illness investigated, poisoning unlikely  "Nearly a dozen members of our delegation were stricken, even George, who started to feel sick during an early morning staff briefing," Mrs. Bush writes. "[O]ne of our military aides had difficulty walking and a White House staffer lost all hearing in one ear. Exceedingly alarmed, the Secret Service went on full alert, combing the resort for potential poisons."  "George felt so ill that he met with [French President Nicolas] Sarkozy and did not even stand up to greet him," she continues, adding later, "We never learned if any other delegations became ill, or if ours, mysteriously, was the only one."  Excerpts of the book were first published by The New York Times on Tuesday.  The 432-page memoir is both a recount of the rare experience of being a first lady and a reflection of the eight years she spent in the White House as her husband's popularity gradually declined.  Among the book's most poignant passages are those that delve into Mrs. Bush's involvement in a 1963 car collision in Midland, Texas, that killed her good friend who happened to be driving the other car.  The spotty details surrounding the accident became fodder for Bush's opponents during his first run for the White House, and Mrs. Bush rarely addressed the matter in public.  Mrs. Bush covers the accident extensively in the memoir, revealing it occurred after she ran a stop sign in a rush to a drive-in theater. Then 17, Mrs. Bush was driving a car that collided with that of Mike Douglas, a fellow student at Mrs. Bush's school. Douglas was pronounced dead when he arrived at the hospital.  "In the aftermath, all I felt was guilty, very guilty. In fact, I still do. It is a guilt I will carry for the rest of my life, far more visible to me than the scar etched in the bump of my knee," Mrs. Bush writes.  "The whole time I was praying that the person in the other car was alive. In my mind, I was calling 'Please, God. Please, God. Please, God,' over and over and over again."  Mrs. Bush writes she and a friend were talking when she ran the stop sign but also says the intersection was highly dangerous, the road was dark, and she could barely see the stop sign.  Guilt-ridden, Mrs. Bush says she lost her faith for "many, many years."  "It was the first time that I had prayed to God for something, begged him for something, not the simple childhood wishing on a star but humbly begging for another human life. And it was as if no one heard. My begging, to my seventeen-year-old mind, had made no difference. The only answer was the sound of Mrs. Douglas's sobs on the other side of that thin emergency room curtain."  Much of the book's early chapters are devoted to a recounting of family history, with a special emphasis on the tragedies faced by her family as they weathered the Great Depression and her own personal beginnings as a young woman coming of age in Midland, Texas.  Mrs. Bush writes passionately about the time she spent after college teaching minority students in the large cities of Texas, before she met her future husband.  Mrs. Bush also reveals that she initially received a cold reception from Barbara Bush after marrying her son.  "[F]rom the start, she was ferociously tart-tongued. She's never shied away from saying what she thinks," Bush writes. "She's managed to insult nearly all of my friends with one or another perfectly-timed acerbic comment."  The relationship improved, however, when Laura and George moved to Washington to be closer to his parents, she writes.  The memoir covers in detail many of the policy initiatives that the first lady undertook while in office, including her efforts to promote women's rights in Afghanistan and childhood literacy in the United States.  The first lady also acknowledges a misstep made by her twin daughters, who were caught trying to order alcoholic drinks in Austin, Texas, before their 21st birthday.  "That night in Austin was just dumb, in the way that so many nineteen-year-olds are dumb," Mrs. Bush writes.  "But what bothered me long after the incident was over was the image left behind in the public mind, that Barbara and Jenna were party girls."  Much as she did during her time as first lady, Mrs. Bush for the most part avoids commenting on politics. But she does point to the 1992 presidential campaign of Bush senior as being particularly nasty. Mrs. Bush writes that during the campaign, critics created "the most hideous caricatures of George H.W. Bush until I barely recognized my own father-in-law."  Bush also criticizes former presidential candidate John Kerry for mentioning the sexual orientation of Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter during a 2004 debate, calling the move "cheap and tawdry" and suggests the campaign opened the door to a more hostile atmosphere for political candidates and their families.  "The strategy of making Mary Cheney's private life an issue failed with the voters in November of 2004," Bush writes. "But in the years since, it has become acceptable to mock candidates and their families, and other elected officeholders, in highly personal ways; David Letterman feels free to ridicule Sarah Palin's teenage daughters, and the audience laughs. That is the legacy of the 2004 campaign."  Mrs. Bush also uses the memoir to air a few gripes against her husband's most vocal congressional critics, specifically Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Reid once called Bush a "loser," while Pelosi said he was an "incompetent leader."  "The comments were uncalled for and graceless," Bush writes. "While a president's political opponents, as well as his supporters, are entitled to make what they see as legitimate criticisms, and while our national debates should be spirited, these particular worlds revealed the petty and parochial nature of some who serve in Congress."  "George, as president, would never have used such language about them," she adds.  President George W. Bush's own memoir, "Decision Points," is set for a November 2010 release.  
 Columbus, Ohio The campaign of Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney tried Wednesday to put the best possible spin on Super Tuesday's mixed verdict, releasing a memo arguing that it is now nearly impossible for his opponents to catch him in the delegate hunt.  "Super Tuesday dramatically reduced the likelihood that any of Gov. Romney's opponents can obtain the Republican nomination," said Rich Beeson, the campaign's political director. "As Gov. Romney's opponents attempt to ignore the basic principles of math, the only person's odds of winning they are increasing are President Obama's."  According to CNN's latest delegate count, Romney now has 404 delegates, compared with 165 for Rick Santorum, 106 for Newt Gingrich and 66 for Ron Paul. To claim the nomination, a candidate will need 1,144 delegates when Republicans meet for their national convention in Tampa this summer.  None of Romney's opponents "succeeded in closing (the) delegate deficit" Tuesday, and "the calendar ahead offers them dwindling opportunities to close the gap," Beeson said. He called Super Tuesday a "one-time opportunity" to reshape the race.  Among other things, Beeson said that there are now few major delegate prizes remaining and that most of the states yet to vote have rules requiring a proportional allocation of delegatesa reality that makes it hard to narrow Romney's lead.  Santorum and Gingrich have argued otherwise, insisting there is still an anti-Romney majority within the Republican Party that can unify in the weeks ahead. Next on the calendar: Kansas holds its caucuses Saturday, followed by contests in Alabama, Mississippi, and Hawaii on Tuesday.  Several U.S. territories will also have the chance to weigh in over the next week, including Guam, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa.  Romney substantially increased his delegate lead on Super Tuesday but failed by most accounts to deliver a knockout blow. He squeezed out a razor-thin popular vote win in the bellwether state of Ohio, while also carrying his home state of Massachusetts, plus Idaho, Vermont, Virginia and Alaska.  Santorum won North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee, while Gingrich cruised to victory in his home state of Georgia.  Paul failed to win in any of the states up for grabs.  Complete Super Tuesday results  Romney was aided by his opponents' organizational failures. Santorum failed to meet the eligibility requirements for a number of delegates up for grabs in Ohio, and neither Santorum nor Gingrich qualified for the Virginia ballot.  Despite his opponents' problems, however, Romney still demonstrated significant weakness with elements of the Republican base. Evangelical voters, Southerners, strong tea party backers and rural residents continued to largely reject the former Massachusetts governor's candidacy.  A substantial number of voters also indicated concern that Romneya wealthy former venture capitalistcannot adequately relate to their daily struggles. In exit polls, 34% of Ohio voters said Santorum best understands the problems of average Americans, compared with only 22% for Romney.  Opinion: Why can't Romney win big?  Romneygenerally perceived as more moderate than Santorum or Gingrich"still has a problem with the base," said Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor who was press secretary for President George W. Bush. "That base problem may make him attractive to independents if he gets to a general" election, but can work against the former governor in the primary season.  Santorum loses among Ohio Catholics  For their part, Santorum's and Gingrich's campaigns have high hopes for upcoming contests in the more conservative Southern and Plains states. Santorum's camp plans to buy about $1 million of ads in Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi, a source with the campaign told CNN.  Santorum's victory in Tennessee hurt Gingrich's strategy in the South after the former House speaker's triumphs in South Carolina and now Georgia.  "It looks we're going to get at least a couple of gold medals, and a whole passel full of silver medals," Santorum told cheering supporters in Ohio before the outcome in the Buckeye State was known.  Santorum stumps his naysayers  For Gingrich, who represented Georgia's Sixth Congressional District for two decades, the home state victory provided a new boost after a string of defeats.  Check in on the Political Ticker  "Thank you Georgia! It is gratifying to win my home state so decisively to launch our March Momentum," Gingrich said Tuesday night in a Twitter post.  "There's lots of bunny rabbits that run through," he later told supporters in Georgia, referring to the earlier revolving door of front-runners in the GOP nomination fight. "I'm the tortoise."  Gingrich vows to keep plugging away  A Gingrich campaign source told CNN on condition of not being identified that the former House speaker will become the third GOP candidate to get Secret Service protection starting Wednesday. Romney and Santorum already have that protection.  Romney entered Super Tuesday off of three wins last week and a growing lead in the race for the right to face off against President Barack Obama in November.  In remarks to supporters in Boston, Romney sounded like the presumptive GOP nominee, focusing his attention on the president.  iReport: Why can't Romney seal the deal?  Citing national unemployment that remains above 8%, Romney said the figure is just an "inconvenient statistic" in the eyes of the Obama administration.  "But those numbers are more than data on a spreadsheet; they are worried families and anxious faces," said Romney, who was interrupted repeatedly by chants and cheers. "And tonight, I'd like to say to each of them: You have not been forgotten. We will not leave you behind. Our campaign is on the move, and real change is finally on the way."  Photos from Super Tuesday  Romney also signaled a continued battle for his campaign.  "Tonight we've taken one more step towards restoring the promise of America," he said. "Tomorrow we wake up and we start again. And the next day we'll do the same. And so it will go, day by day, step by step, door by door, heart to heart."  Santorum also focused on Obama, saying the president's policies threatened the individual liberty of Americans. But he targeted Romney as well for his health care law in Massachusetts, arguing it was the model for Obama's federal health care reforms detested by conservatives.  "I've never been for a mandate at a state or a federal level," Santorum said in challenging the requirement in both the Massachusetts and federal laws for people to have health coverage.  Delegate tracker | delegate calculator  Despite lingering concerns about Romney's conservative credentials on health care and other issues, the former governor's campaign was bolstered by endorsements from several leading conservatives this week, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia; Oklahoma Sen.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began explosions Monday night at the Birds Point-New Madrid levee at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.  The explosions, near the southern border between Missouri and Illinois, marked the start of a three-stage process to intentionally breach the leveeand, in the process, pave the way for tons of water to flood 130,000 acres of Missouri farmlandto alleviate pressure caused by historically high water levels in the rivers.  At 5 p.m. Monday, the water level outside Cairo, Illinois, was 61.44 feetwell above the flood stage of 40 feetaccording to the National Weather Service. Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh ordered the intentional breach.  "(The system) continues to be under enormous and unprecedented pressure," said Walsh, the president of the Mississippi River Commission. "Because of that ... I've ordered the district commander to operate the project."  Walsh said that historic and still-rising flood waters made it imperative to begin the explosive operation as soon as possible. The multistage process is expected to continue through Tuesday.  Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster's office tried to block the move, challenging the Corps' authority to breach the levee. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in a ruling from Justice Samuel Alito, denied Missouri's bid.  On Monday, Gov. Jay Nixon issued a statement saying he had talked with Walsh about the attempt "to relieve pressure on other parts of the levee system and save lives." He said Missouri authorities are ready for the blast and subsequent flood.  "I urge Missourians to continue to cooperate fully with state, county and local law enforcement, as they have at every stage of this process," Nixon said. "Together, we will ensure that Missouri families stay safe in the coming days. And together, we will recover and rebuild."  Without an intentional breach, authorities had warned of massive flooding that could wipe out Cairo. Already, Cairo's mayor ordered the city's 2,800 residents to evacuate.  Walsh acknowledged the human dimension of his plan, which has irked many in Missouri, where hundreds more have been evacuated. Nixon has estimated that it will take tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars to recover property and rebuild lives as the water rushes through the floodway, including washing out farmland he described as "literally the most productive part of our continent."  "It's a heart-wrenching story," Walsh said. "It takes a long time to recover from something like this."  He said the fate of Cairo was just one of many factors in his decision, saying he hoped the move would alleviate issues throughout the Mississippi River system. Water levels and flooding have hit record highs in many spots, putting severe strains on systems meant to prevent uncontrolled floods and the resulting loss of life and property.  With rain continuing to fall and water levels continuing to rise, Walsh said the situation would only get worse without drastic action.  "Nobody has seen this type of water in the system," he said. "This is unprecedented."  And he did not rule out similar moves elsewhere, including possibly more purposeful explosions at other levees along the Mississippi and its tributaries.  The area, in Missouri's so-called "Bootheel," is one of four floodways along the system that could be opened up. Walsh said he expected the Birds Point-New Madrid levee breach will cause river crests to drop three to four feet "for a few days," even as he voiced concerns that water levels could very well rise again.  "This doesn't end this historic flood," said Walsh. "This is not going to be over when we operate this."  
 Washington Three U.S. Airways-operated jets at Reagan National Airport came closer than they should have because of an air traffic control "miscommunication," federal authorities said Thursday.  The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon when air traffic controllers were making adjustments for landing and departing aircraft because of bad weather.  Chautauqua Airlines flight 3071 came within 800 vertical feet and .82 nautical miles after take-off of an arriving aircraft, identified as Republic Airlines flight 3329, authorities said.  TSA credits officers with rescuing kidnapped woman  The third plane involved was Republic Airlines flight 3467, which was taking off and came within 2.07 nautical miles and 800 vertical feet of the arriving flight.  "During the switchover of operations, miscommunication between the Tracon and the DCA tower led to a loss of the required separation between two regional jets departing from Runway 1 and a regional jet inbound for Runway 19," the Federal Aviation Administration said.  "Tracon," or terminal radar approach control, is a reference to a regional radar facility. "DCA" is the International Air Transport Association code for Reagan National Airport.  "At no point were the three aircrafts on a head-to-head course," said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.  The FAA is investigating and plans to take "appropriate action to address the miscommunication."  "Such near misses and any operational errors are calls to action," said Rep. John L. Mica, R-Florida. "I'm asking our Aviation Subcommittee staff and FAA to thoroughly review what happened."  Based on tower recordings, a controller told one of the pilots to "hold on, we're trying to figure this out."  "We really don't have the fuel for this," the pilot responded. "We've got to get on the ground pretty quick."  The controller then said, "Everybody stand by. We've got a couple of opposite direction arrivals, so it's gonna be a little bit of a delay in your departures."  Passenger finds needle in Air Canada sandwich  US Airways issued a statement saying, "We are currently investigating and working with the FAA to determine what occurred. The safety of our customers and employees is always our top priority."  The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday that it will investigate.  Its probe will involve a review of communications recordings and radar data, as well as interviews with supervisors and controllers in coming days, according to NTSB spokesman Eric M. Weiss.  "Safety is NATCA's top priority," added Paul Rinaldi, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. "We are always looking to enhance the safety and efficiency of the National Airspace System, and we will participate in any investigation that looks into improving the system."  Last year, an air traffic controller was suspended for failing to respond to two planes heading into National Airport after he fell asleep on the midnight shift.  The two planes landed without incident.  Suspicious object that forces plane to divert is unclaimed camera  CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report

London British Home Secretary Theresa May defended Thursday the government's decision to bring in an additional 3,500 military personnel to ensure security for the Olympic Games, only 15 days before the event starts.  She said it had only become clear on Wednesday that the contractor G4S was not able to provide all the security staff it had promised to the organizers of the London Olympic Games.  But, May told the House of Commons, "there is no question of Olympic security being compromised."  The government's decision to bring in additional troops, on top of the 13,500 already agreed, was the appropriate response to the shortfall in G4S staff, she said.  Read more: Is Olympic-level security already under way in Britain?  "Contingency planning has always been central to our security work," May said.  The deployment means that 17,000 troops will be on duty in the United Kingdom during the Games, compared with the 9,500 currently in Afghanistan.  G4S had been expected to recruit a staff of more than 10,000 as part of a total security force of 23,700 for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. It will still provide several thousand personnel.  Britain is on a heightened state of alert ahead of the Games, which open on 27 July.  Grilled by opposition politicians as she gave an emergency statement to the House of Commons, May rejected suggestions that the government had either not been on top of planning for the event or had been misled by G4S about its preparations.  "This is not a lax approach to security, it is about the government ensuring we have the right approach to security," May said.  Her opposition counterpart, Labour's Yvette Cooper, said it looked like "another Home Office shambles."  Read more: Weather warning: London Olympics' biggest threat?  May said it was the organizing committee's responsibility to ensure that G4S honored its contract and to enforce any penalties written into the contract, and that the British public would not pick up the bill for the security firm's failings.  A Home Office statement released late Wednesday said: "The government are committing 553 million for venue security and we remain confident that we will deliver within budget."  A G4S spokesman said in a statement that the contractor is "committed to ensuring that London 2012 is safe and secure" and that it understands the government's decision to bring in extra troops.  G4S already has about 4,000 people at work across 100 venues and has more than 9,000 people going through the required vetting, training and accreditation process, the statement said.  "This is an unprecedented and very complex security recruitment and deployment exercise which is being carried out to a very tight schedule," it said.  "We have encountered some delays in progressing applicants through the final stages but we are working extremely hard to process these as swiftly as possible."  The military personnel on duty will include reservists, the Ministry of Defence said, and the Olympic organizers have agreed to give 10,000 tickets to the armed forces to compensate for the short-notice deployment.  "I can confirm that there remains no specific threat to the Games. Nor is there an increased threat to the Games," said Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. We are confident that the UK is ready and able to provide a safe and secure Olympic Games for the whole world to enjoy."  May also faced repeated questions from lawmakers over border control at Heathrow Airport, amid concerns over staffing levelsas some visitors wait more than two hours to enter the countryand the stringency of security checks.  Staffing is being stepped up for the Olympics, with additional personnel being brought in to ensure all desk are manned, May said.  The United Kingdom's independent chief inspector of borders, John Vine, said Wednesday there had been some progress since a critical report in February, but the extra staff drafted in to ease congestion "often processed passengers less quickly and asked fewer questions."  He also cited concerns over efforts to detect forged documents in some of the airport's terminals.  Meanwhile, work to repair the main route from Heathrow Airport into London continues, following the discovery of significant cracks in a viaduct.  A section of the M4 motorway has been closed in both directions since the end of last week, resulting in broad delays for drivers forced to take alternative routes into the capital.  The Highways Agency, which is in charge of the UK road network, said Wednesday that the road would remain closed because the complex repair work had reached a critical stage.  "The Highways Agency and its contractors are working around the clock and will reopen the motorway as soon as it is safe to do so," it said. "Conditional on the repair work being successful, it is still expected that the work will be completed and the road reopened within the next few days."  
 If you're confused about whether the Iran deal is an awe-inspiring breakthrough or a cataclysmic disaster, let me help you: The answer is it depends.  It depends on what happens in the coming six months.  And not just six months from now, but what happens between now and then: a period during which Iran and the world powers are supposed to abide by the deal they made in Geneva last weekend and work to hammer out a permanent agreement.  If the Geneva deal in its current form becomes permanent because the two sides can't get to a final resolution and drag out its current terms (the six-month period is "renewable by mutual consent," says the so-called Joint Plan of Action), then what occurred this weekend will mark a calamitous turning point, triggering a chain of events that brings about the very developments that Obamaand most of the worldwant to avoid.  If the accord indeed proves to be temporary, as President Obama maintains it is, to be followed by a much more stringent agreement that brings a verifiable and credible end to Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapons' capability, then we can rightly call it a historic turning point, a milestone to progress.  Then, Obama and his secretary of state will deserve enormous credit for their achievement. For now, however, hold off on the awards.  The deal has some positive points, but it also has many deeply troubling elements. Remember: Tehran has a track record of dragging out negotiations; negotiations started more than a decade ago. And if the six months start to slip, an arms race in the Middle East is sure to start.  The Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, fear a nuclear Iran even more than Israel does. Arabs and Persians are historic rivals, even enemies. Iran's revolutionary regime has a stated purpose of spreading revolution, in direct opposition to the stability and survival of the ruling Gulf regimes. The Gulf states will not sit idly by while Iran continues enriching uranium, especially after the world has repeatedly discovered Iran operating secret nuclear facilities in the past.  Once Saudi Arabia and Iran engage in a nuclear arms race, others will jump in. Qatar has a rivalry with Saudi Arabia; Egypt looks askance at Qatar, and Turkey will not want to be left behind.  The entire region will be swept up in a feverish pursuit of nuclear technology. If you think adding a nuclear arms race to the extremist ideological maelstrom of the Middle East is like adding fuel to flames, you are wrong: It is like adding dynamite to a raging fire.  Many people incorrectly describe the Joint Plan as a freeze on Iran's nuclear program. But it is not. The deal reverses some parts of the program, it freezes others, but it allows progress to continue in two areas.  The three most significant achievements of the interim deal are the dismantling of the stockpile of 20% enriched uranium, the stoppage of work in the Arak heavy water reactor that could produce plutoniumanother path to nuclear weaponsand the introduction of more intrusive monitors by U.N. nuclear inspectors.  But the accord does not open up the Parchin facility, where U.N. monitors have already said they suspect Iran is testing ways to weaponize nuclear materials. And the deal, most significantly, allows Iran to continue enriching uranium up to 5% purity. Iran maintains this will become permanent. Washington has given mixed signals on the issue.  That is one of the two massive concessions made by the major powers. The U.N. Security Council had demanded that Iran stop enriching uranium. Now the United States and the other five countries have implicitly allowed enrichment to continue in violation of U.N. resolutions. In addition, they have started a rollback of the painstakingly built sanctions' regime.  The final comprehensive agreement with Iran will come only if Iran truly has decided to give up on what most of the world believes was a goal of either developing nuclear weapons or getting close enough that it is able to do it in quick order, what is known as "breakout capability."  Iran's new president. Hassan Rouhani, most certainly has presented a much more conciliatory face to the West. But the real power rests with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose rhetoric remains caustic. Just last week, as talks got started in Geneva, Khamenei lashed out at the United States and said Israel is "doomed to annihilation."  Is Iran now ready to give up what most countries believe is a nuclear weapons program after decades of investment and after enduring enormous hardship to build it? If so, a deal can certainly be reached.  Has Iran perhaps reached a more limited objective, with significant but not complete progress? In that case, it will likely try to bring an end to sanctions while holding on to much of the progress. If that is the case, negotiations will prove enormously difficult, even impossible. Or, will Iran try to cheat?  Whatever the answer, it is imperative that the United States be prepared to call out Iran if it finds any violations to the agreement. Otherwise, Obama and the United States risk becoming apologists for the Islamic Republic.  Diplomacy requires negotiating with foes, and this is no exception. The Iranian regime is a serial violator of its own people's rights. It is a state sponsor of terrorism, and it is the principal sponsor of extremist militias, such as Hezbollah, and the brutal regime of Syria's Bashar al-Assad.  If the United States can prevent Iran's dangerous regime from achieving nuclear weapons capabilityand not just in the short term; if it can prevent an arms race in the region, and it can do so without military action, then the Geneva deal will have proved a triumph. We will find out over the course of the next six months.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.

 The family of Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old girl whose quest for a lung transplant prompted a change in national transplant policy, said Thursday her first biopsy shows no rejection of her donor lungs.  Sarah, who was born with cystic fibrosis, had the lung transplant June 12 and is still unable to talk because of tubes in her throat. But in a video shared by her family Thursdaythe first one since her surgerySarah waves and mouths "hi" and "I love you" to her mother, sitting off camera.  The family said Sarah had surgery Wednesday to fix her diaphragm to support her new lungs. The biopsy was taken during the operation, they said.  "Sarah had a nice, stable night," the family wrote on a Facebook page set up for Sarah. "Her pain is increased, but they seem to be able to manage it. Overall she seems relieved the surgery is over, sitting waiting yesterday made her very anxious."  The diaphragm surgery was Sarah's fourth in less than a month. Shortly after her lung transplant June 12, the donated lungs failed, and Sarah had emergency surgery to put her on a bypass machine that took over the work of the lungs.  Sarah received a new set of lungs three days later.  Her family explained later that the first set of lungs was in poor condition when Sarah received them, but they decided to proceed with the surgery because "Sarah was out of time to wait."  The second set of lungs was infected with pneumonia, but again the family went ahead with the transplant because "they were Sarah's best and only hope." Since then, the family says, her lungs have improved with each day and continue to work better and better.  Sarah was on the transplant list for children's lungs for 18 months. She wasn't able to qualify for adult lungs because she was too young; the agency that oversees transplants, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, had a policy that children only 12 or older could be prioritized for adult organs.  The family petitioned Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to change the rules so Sarah could qualify for adult lungs. They argued the rule was unfair, and several lawmakers also asked Sebelius to act.  On June 5, the Murnaghans asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block Sebelius from having the organ network apply the rule. The judge granted the injunction and ordered Sebelius to direct the network to waive the rule in Sarah's case.  The family said they never asked that Sarah be placed in front of anyone on the transplant list who was in a more serious condition.  Days later, the organ network approved a change to their policy to allow lung transplant programs to request additional priority for younger transplant candidates. The change is effective for a year, when it must be approved by the board of directors.

It was a match of two halves for world No. 3 Roger Federer as he moved into the second round of Dubai Championships with victory over Michael Llodra.  The 16-time grand slam winner took just 18 minutes to wrap up the first set 6-0 against his French opponent but struggled in the second before eventually taking it on a tie-break.  The Swiss, who recently won the World Tennis Tournament in the Dutch city of Rotterdam to take his career titles count to 71, is gunning for a fifth crown in Dubai.  "It's always great to start off a tournament winning the first set 6-0," second seed Federer told the ATP Tour's official website.  A family affair in Dubai but mixed results for the Djokovic brothers  "After that, I really had to sort of make sure I controlled Michael as much as I could because I know he's a dangerous player.  "I think I was solid. I could have served maybe a touch better. But still, I was never really in a whole lot of problems.  "Tie-breakers, as we saw, can go quickly either way, especially on a quick court like tonight. I hope I back it up day for day now."  Federer will face unseeded Spaniard Feliciano Lopez in round two, after he beat Nicolas Mahut, of France, 6-4 6-4.  Britain's Andy Murray was far from his best as he labored to a 6-3 4-6 6-4 victory over German qualifier Michael Berrer in his first match since his Australian Open semifinal defeat to world No. 1 Novak Djokovic.  "It was a frustrating match because I was up a break in the second set, and I gave it back," Murray told reporters.  "In the third set, again I went up a break and gave the break straight back. So I could have made it a little bit easier for myself if I played a bit better."  Murray's next opponent will be Switzerland's Marco Chiudinelli after he beat Russian Nikolay Davydenko 6-4 5-7 6-4.  Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, from France, recorded a 7-6 6-4 win over Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis to set up a match with Lukas Rosol from the Czech Republic.  Rosol's compatriot Tomas Berdych, seeded fifth, enjoyed a comfortable 6-2 6-2 win over Germany's Benjamin Becker and will face Slovakian qualifier Lukas Lacko in round two.  No. 8 seed Juan Martin Del Potro, from Argentina, beat Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3 7-6 to set up a clash with qualifier Andrey Golubev.

But first ... he has to graduate high school in May.  Jack Andraka is going to bring his 3-cent screening test for pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer to marketan alternative to a standard $800 test. But Jack, 16, hasn't been to high school much lately and isn't even sure he'll graduate.  The two teenagers with Justin Bieber style haircuts wowed the 1,400 people who attended TED2013 this week, fitting the conference's theme: "The Young. The Wise. The Undiscovered." They were among a number of youthful speakers who Time magazine's Ruth Davis Konigsberg called "some of the biggest showstoppers at the annual event."  By contrast, some of the older voices onstage struck notes that were far less hopeful. Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon declared that the era of strong economic growth in the United States is overas America faces the headwinds of an aging population, debt, inequality and educational weaknesses; he argued that it's hard to foresee innovations that could have the transformative effect electricity, indoor plumbing and the internal combustion engine had in powering growth in the past century.  Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, calling for a private sector-funded "race to the top" among states, lamented the inability of Washington politicians to develop a national energy strategy. She got laughs when she noted that Congress' approval rating is worse than lice, root canals and Donald Trump (although better than that of gonorrhea and meth labs).  TED.com: Granholm's clean energy proposal  And Lawrence Lessig, an author and professor at Harvard Law School, sketched an even starker picture of political dysfunction, a "pathological, democracy-destroying corruption" in which a tiny minority of Americans representing powerful interests use their campaign donations to determine which candidates survive the primaries. Even against long odds, Lessig said the problem is fixable if enough Americans organize to bring about change.  There were other speakers whose inventiveness and ambition were unambiguously upbeat.  Jane Chen spoke about developing a lower-tech method to save the lives of premature and low birthweight babies in regions where access to incubators isn't readily available. Her social enterprise Embrace distributes a specially engineered and heated sleeping bag that provides babies the heat they can't generate on their own until they're developed enough to survive.  Google CEO Sergey Brin demonstrated Google Glass, a smartphone-like piece of headgear that enables access to your contacts, your e-mail, your searches and your photos. His pitch for the devicenow being tested by a select few for $1,500 apiece and due on the market later this yearis partly that it frees people up from the "nervous habit" of constantly checking their smartphone as they walk: "Is this what you're meant to do with your body?"  TED.com: Amanda Palmerthe art of asking  David Lang, talked of his Open ROV project, which markets an $800 kitusing off-the-shelf partsfor a remotely operated underwater vehicle that gives its makers the ability to explore underwater worlds in James Cameron fashion.  PayPal co-founder Elon Musk didn't mention his recent dispute with a New York Times reporter over the battery range of the all-electric Tesla Model S, but made a case for the car's virtues before describing his effort to market solar panels to homeowners and businesses and his SpaceX commercial venture to the heavens. He screened a video of a reusable 12-story-tall rocket launching, hovering and then returning to a launchpad ready for another flight.

It uses the brains of the phone's computer chip, its camera and a plastic chassis with tank-style treads to zip around a room, express emotions, interact with owners, kids and pets, and function as "Skype on wheels" for grandparents dropping in for a virtual visit.  Edith Widder, part of the three-person team that developed the device that lured a giant squid to an underwater camera, explained how it was able to get the first-ever video displaying the enormous size and intricacy of the animal in the deep ocean.  13-year old invents system to protect family livestock from lions  Ron Finley, an activist in South Central Los Angeles, is leading an effort to counter the neighborhood's "food desert," by growing fruits and vegetables on city owned and private land. "If kids grow kale, they'll eat kale," he said. "If kids grow tomatoes, they'll eat tomatoes."  Renowned photographer Sebastio Salgado showed finely etched works from his forthcoming book "Genesis," a 50-pound, $3,000 behemoth (there's a less elegant and smaller version for under $70) that does justice to the detail of his exquisitely composed black and white photos shot around the world.  TED.com: Sugata Mitrabuild a school in the cloud  Stewart Brand, the 78-year-old technologist who came to fame as editor of "The Whole Earth Catalog," introduced an ambitious plan to recreate extinct species, using DNA from museum specimens. The effort, echoing "Jurassic Park", won't bring back dinosaurstheir DNA didn't survive the tens of millions of years since they disappearedbut aims to "de-extinct" such species as the passenger pigeon, declared extinct in 1914.  TED normally attracts an audience of the elite of Silicon Valley, Hollywood and venture capital, along with foundation and corporate CEOs, who pay $7,500 for the five-day event, which is moving next year from Long Beach to Vancouver. (CNN has a partnership with TED in which it publishes selected TED Talks along with text pieces by speakers).  TED stands for "technology, entertainment and design," although its subject matter has branched out widely since its founding nearly 30 years ago.  The ingenuity of this year's youthful speakers was remarkable, and so was the confident way they expressed their ideas. Wilson, 18, is finishing high school while also attending the University of Nevada at Reno. He first attracted attention for creating a nuclear fusion reactor at 14.  In his TED Talk, he argued for an alternative to the most widely used nuclear power technologies.  Rather than create electricity by heating water and turning a turbine, Wilson's new reactor would use nuclear fission to produce energy from molten salt. His plan would be to centrally manufacture small fission reactors and distribute them widely for burial underground. He said they could last for 30 years without refueling, compared with 18 months for larger commercial reactors.  Since the reactors would not be pressurized, radioactivity would not be expelled as widely into the environment as in an accident like the Fukushima disaster, Wilson said. Costs would be lower since reactors would not have to be built onsite. Nuclear weapons could be recycled in the reactor, he said. And most exciting to the young space geek, such a reactor could power a spaceship to a distant planet and then be the power source for a human base at the destination, he said.  Andraka, who's 16 and a high school sophomore, won the top prize in the Intel Science Fair competition for his cancer screening test, which relies in part on carbon nanotubes to detect a protein that is present in the blood and urine in the early stages of the three deadly cancers, providing hope that they can be detected in time for a successful cure.  He told CNN in an interview that he doesn't go to high school much anymore but is busy with other projectsincluding inventing an MRI the size of a credit card and leading a team of high school students competing for the $10 million Tricorder X Prize to design a handheld device people could use to monitor their health.  Andraka and Wilson probably don't have to worry about it but another speaker added a sobering element to the celebration of youth at TED. Meg Jay, a psychologist and author, argued against the idea that the 20s are a period of extended adolescence where people can postpone key life choices. By the time people reach 30, they may have missed out on some key chances to take their life in the directions they hope to pursue. "Thirty is not the new twenty," she said, urging people to "claim your adulthood" and start making choices.  Spoken word poet Shane Koyczan, a 36-year-old whose new video "To This Day" has attracted 5.5 million views, offered a reminder that for all that young people can achieve, many still carry a heavy burden. He told of being bullied as a child to the point that, without realizing it, he turned into a bully himself. He spoke of kids being called names, making them feel like "oddities juggling depression and loneliness" and challenged them:  "if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself  get a better mirror  look a little closer  stare a little longer  because there's something inside you  that made you keep trying  despite everyone who told you to quit"

(CNNMxico)Mexican food was the great star of the second state dinner held in the Obama administration.  In honor of President Felipe Calderon, the menu was Mexican dishes made from iconic American ingredients with herbs and vegetables that were grown in the White House gardens.  Who would dare surprise a Mexican president with Mexican dishes in Washington?  The chosen chef was Rick Bayless, one of the great gurus of Mexican cuisine in the United States, who has popularized his dishes through his TV program, six cookbooks and, of course, his three restaurants: the casual Frontera Grill, the four-star Topolobampo and the newly opened Xoco.  His restaurants are in Chicago, and the Obamas were regular patrons before the couple moved to Washington.  Still, the James Beard Award-winning chef was surprised to be invited to their new home.  "I could hardly believe it. I kept going back to see if I actually had been invited or if it was a mistake ... no, it is an amazing honor to be invited to cook at the White House," Bayless said in an interview with CNNMxico.  The evening's dishes were carefully chosen after consulting with first lady Michelle Obama and executive White House chef Cristeta Comerford.  "We started with menus that we knew that the president and first lady had enjoyed, things that they have enjoyed they were at our restaurants. And we put two or three different menus because I didn't know how they did the service at the White House, and you have to make the menu tailored to the way the kitchen is set up. You can't do all things in all kitchens," Bayless explained.  "We learned that we couldn't serve soup because we knew that the first lady really enjoyed the tortilla soup, the soup that we do, but she said it was too hard to serve for 200 because the service is really fast."  And finally, what was the menu?  The guests began their dinner with a Jicama salad with oranges, grapefruit and pineapple citrus vinaigrette served with a Chardonnay Ulisis Valdez Russian River 2007.  This was followed by an herb green ceviche of Hawaiian opah (fish) with sesame-cilantro crackers.  The main dish was Oregon Wagyu beef in Oaxacan black mole accompanied by black bean tamalon and grilled green beans, paired with a Cabernet Sauvignon Herrera Seleccin Rebecca 2006.  Finally, dessert was chocolate-cajeta tart with toasted homemade marshmallows, graham cracker crumble and goat cheese ice cream accompanied by a Mumm Napa Carlos Santana Brut champagne.  "The whole idea about a state dinnerand people don't usually understand thisbut when you are hosting a dignatary from a foreign country it is not common to serve food from their country. It is common to serve them the best of American cuisine, because you are hosting them," Bayless said.  "It's huge departure for Obama administration to have served food of Mexico, but they did it because of my work, I have really brought the true flavors from Mexico to the United States... however, we did feature a number of fabulous American ingredients like the opah  from Hawaii and the Wagyu from Oregon."  "I loved it... it was such a great menu that we are going to put that menu as one of our tasting menus in Topolobampo in a couple of weeks", said Bayless, who was born in Oklahoma City but  lived in Mexico from 1980 to 1986.  Of all the praises chef Bayless received for the dinner, two made him particularly happy. One, from Mexican first lady Margarita Zavala, "who said that she loved the ceviche verde that we did, she told me that two or three times that she loved that ceviche." The other, from President Calderon, "who said that it was one of the best mole negro he had ever had," said Bayless.  The White House blogged about the dinner  That mole was precisely the most complicated part of the dinner, not only because it takes more than 20 ingredients and seven hours to make, but also for another reason.  "I didn't want the flavors of the toasting chiles and things like that to get out of the kitchen and waft the White House. I thought it was inappropriate to do that. Cris Comerford, the chef there, she ensured me that they had really good exhaust systems and she was right, it took all those aromas out, but I toasted the chiles just a few at a time so the aroma would not leak out of the kitchen," Bayless added.  At the end, the labor was well worth it because, the chef said, "It's one of the best moles I have ever made."  Bayless is used to working under the spotlight-- he also took top honors on Bravo's "Top Chef Masters" TV program.  
 Gunmen stopped a bus near Beirut, Lebanon, in the early hours of Friday, boarded it and kidnapped two Turkish pilots, Turkey's foreign ministry said.  The pilots work for Turkish Airlines. They were riding the bus from Rafic Hariri International Airport to their hotel when the assailants in two vehicles stopped it, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported.  Reports on the number of attackers varied from four to eight.  Other employees aboard the bus made it safely to the hotel and are to head back to Turkey later Friday, the foreign ministry said.  "The Lebanese government has begun taking the necessary steps for an investigation," the ministry said.  Security agents questioned the driver as a witness, the news agency reported.  CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report

From the time she was an 11-year-old, blue-eyed, freckle-faced blonde until she was a 29-year-old woman with two children, Jaycee Dugard was kept locked away in a backyard compound of sheds and tarps by a couple who police say abducted her.  Jaycee Dugard was locked in a shed tucked under a blue tarp in her alleged captor's backyard.  She was more than 160 miles from home, and her family had no idea where she was.  Nobody else knew she was there except the couple who snatched her off the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991, and took her straight to the soundproof shed, police said.  Dugard's pocket of Phillip and Nancy Garrido's backyard in Antioch, California, was so overgrown no one even knew it existed.  The details about Dugard's time in captivity emerged Thursday after one of Northern California's most enduring mysteries was solved and the Garridos were arrested and accused of her kidnapping.  Anyone who came across the couple's backyard, littered with garbage cans and a dishwasher, would assume that it ended at a 6-foot fence.  Watch aerial images of the backyard compound   "You could walk through the backyard and never know there was another set of living circumstances," said Fred Kollar, undersheriff of El Dorado County. "There was nothing that would cause you to question it. You can't see it from either adjoining property. It was presumably well arranged."  But tucked away beyond the tangle of bushes, high grass and trees was a blue tarp that concealed the only world Dugard had known since her abduction.  Kollar said the property had "a hidden backyard within a backyard." It included several sheds no taller than 6 feet, two tents and several outbuildings, "where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives."  It also held a vehicle that matched the description of the car used in Dugard's kidnapping, Kollar said.  The "secondary" backyard was inside the first and was "screened from view." One of the sheds was soundproof, he said.  In it were sheds and tarps, a makeshift bathroom and shower, along with electricity supplied by extension cords. Kollar compared the primitive conditions to camping.  Dugard lived for several years there by herself. The sheds were locked from the outside.  She grew up and had her captor's children there, and raised them there.  "None of them have ever been to school, they've never been to a doctor," Kollar said. "They were kept in complete isolation in this compound, if you will, at the rear of the house," he said. "They were born there."  The children, both girls, are now 15 and 11.  "They are all in good health," Kollar said in response to a question about how Dugard and her children are doing. "But living in a backyard for the last 18 years does take its toll."  Dugard's presence behind Garrido's home apparently went unnoticed by many in the neighborhood, where homes on one-fourth to one-half-acre lots typically sell for less than $200,000.  Watch neighbors react   "My dad said he never saw a young woman," said Kathy Russo, whose father has lived two houses away from the Garridos for 33 years.  She said the one-story house's backyard was obscured by trees and ringed by a wooden fence. Her 94-year-old father considered Garrido to be a "kind of strange, reclusive, kind of an angry kind of guy," Russo said.  But one man who lives in the neighborhood told CNN that he called the local sheriff's department a few years ago after seeing what he thought were several children living in the backyard.  The man said authorities came out and had a brief conversation with the Garrido family, but nothing ever happened.  
 NEW YORK Every weekend for more than four years, Fred Murray has walked the road where his daughter, Maura, vanished. Family, friends and volunteers help him look in the woods and mountains near Haverhill, New Hampshire, for clues to what happened to her.  Maura Murray, 21, disappeared while driving in the New Hampshire woods on a snowy night in 2004.  Maura Murray, a 21-year-old nursing student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, disappeared on a cold and snowy night in February 2004. She was last known to be driving from Massachusetts through New Hampshire. It is still unclear where she was heading in her black 1996 Saturn.  The car was found abandoned, its front end crashed against a tree. It apparently had skidded off a road at a sharp curve.  Shortly after the accident, a passing bus driver stopped and asked Murray if she needed help. She said no.  Ten minutes later, police arrived. Inside the crumpled Saturn, they found some of Murray's belongingsschool books, running gear, snack foods and alcoholpolice won't say what kind. But Murray was gone, along with her car keys and a backpack she always carried.  There was nothing to hint she'd be motivated to run away, according to her fianc, William Rausch, and her father, Fred Murray.  Watch why this cold case is a true mystery   Maura Murray had just gotten engaged to Rausch, her college sweetheart and an Army lieutenant stationed in Oklahoma. They planned to marry after she graduated from nursing school in June 2005. She'd found a summer nursing job in Oklahoma. She had everything to look forward to.  "She was in good spirits and had no worries or reason to run away from her life," Fred Murray said.  Investigators initially operated under the theory that the dean's list student was troubled and had decided to escape from the demands of her life for a while. As a result, they did not immediately begin to look for her.  The search did not begin until 39 hours after her crashed car was found. When it finally got under way, helicopters, search dogs and ground teams covered the area near where Murray's car was found.  The dogs picked up her scent for about 100 yards, leading investigators along the road to an area between two homes. There, the dogs lost the trail.  Murray's credit cards and cell phone have not registered any activity since the night she disappeared, February 9, 2004.  Tom Shamshak, a private investigator hired by the Murray family to continue the search, said police and volunteers looked for her for two days.  "No footprints were even found in the snow," he said. "Luckily there hadn't been any fresh snowfall in those two days."  Shamshak has concluded that only two scenarios could explain what happened to Murray. Either she was picked up by someone driving on the road, or she walked to a nearby house to ask for help.  Police say they did not treat Murray's case as an abduction because they saw no signs of a struggle at the scene.  Before she left campus, police learned, Murray had e-mailed her professors and informed them she'd be absent for a few days because of a death in the family. Murray's family and friends said no one in the family had died.  Police also noted that Murray had enough food and other items in her car to suggest she might be taking a short getaway vacation.  Murray is described as 5 feet 7 inches tall, 120 pounds, with brown hair and blue-green eyes. She was last seen wearing a dark coat and jeans and carrying a black backpack and Samsung cell phone.  A $40,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to her whereabouts or the arrest of the person responsible for her disappearance. The tip line is 603-271-2663, New Hampshire State Police.

The number of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus has jumped nearly 30 percent with 331 people being infected so far, the World Health Organization said Friday.  A young couple in Mexico City wear surgical masks in an attempt to avoid contamination from the virus.  The WHO added that the virus had spread to 11 countries, but the hardest hit areas were in the western hemisphere.  "We have not seen sustained human to human transmission anywhere outside the Americas region," said WHO spokesman Thomas Abraham.  Two more countries, Denmark and China, reported cases of the 2009 H1N1 "swine flu" virus on Friday, but they were still to be confirmed by the WHO.  The largest outbreak was in Mexico which had 156 confirmed cases, while there were 141 cases confirmed and one death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The WHO said Mexico had 9 deaths attributed to the virus. But Mexican officials said the death toll had risen to 12.  However, more than 150 deaths in Mexico are suspected to have been caused by the virus and are being investigated, officials there said.  The higher totals do not necessarily mean that incidence of the disease is increasing, but rather that health investigators are going through their backlog of specimens, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of WHO.  In addition to Mexico and the United States, the following countries have so far confirmed non-lethal cases:  Austria: 1  Canada: 34  China: 1 Denmark: 1 Germany: 3 Israel: 2  Netherlands: 1  New Zealand: 3  Spain: 13  Switzerland: 1  United Kingdom: 9  An additional 642 cases are being investigated in the United Kingdom, and Spain has 84 suspected cases.  Australia, which has had no confirmed cases, was investigating 114.

London France's Marion Bartoli has claimed the women's singles title at Wimbledon with a crushing 6-1 6-4 victory over Sabine Lisicki.  The 28-year-old, a losing finalist against Venus Williams in 2007, swept aside her German opponent in one hour 21 minutes to claim her first Grand Slam title.  Bartoli becomes only the second French woman to win Wimbledon in the open era, following in the footsteps of Amelie Mauresmo who won in 2006.  "I'm so happy I am holding the trophy. It has been my dream since I was six years old. I would like to thank everyone in the crowd who supported me today," Bartoli said.  For Lisicki, the vanquisher of Serena Williams in the fourth round and Agnieszka Radwanska in the semis, the disappointment was almost too much to bear.  "Marion has been in that situation before and she handed it perfectly. She deserves it. I hope I get the chance one more time as well." Lisicki said fighting back tears.  Both women started the match nervously losing their opening service games, but it was Bartoli whose game suddenly gelled while Lisicki, appearing in her first Grand Slam title, wilted under the pressure on a sweltering Center Court.  With her game in top gear, Bartoli took the first set in just 29 minutes. A more composed Lisicki returned from a bathroom break and held her opening service game of the second set, before Bartoli reeled off five games in succession.  Lisicki, who stunned Serena Williams in the fourth round, fought to the end holding serve in the seventh game and breaking Bartoli as she served for the match in the next.  Another hold from the German made the score 5-4, but at the second time of asking Bartoli made no mistake, serving out the match to love and finishing with an ace.  
 It's official: It was a great white shark that bit a man's legs last week just off the coast of Truro, Massachusetts.  "This conclusion was reached after examination of the injuries and testimony from (the victim)," said Reginald Zimmerman, a spokesman for the office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.  Chris Myers and his teenage son were swimming toward a sandbar about 500 yards off Ballston Beach. They wanted to body surf where the waves were breaking.  "Apparently I was the only one on Cape Cod who hadn't heard of the shark sightings," Myers told CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday night.  Reports of shark sightings have gone up off the coast of Massachusetts in recent years, especially around areas where seals congregate.  Shark-bite victim: 'Only one option, which was swim'  But just after the pair decided to turn around, something bit the man's leg.  "I figured it was either an elephant ... or a polar bear ... or a shark. So pretty quickly I got to shark," Myers jokes. "It felt like I was in a very, very heavy vise."  The great white shark then surfaced between father and son, who were about 6 feet apart, arching its back as if intentionally showing itself to them, he said.  The shark slipped under the waters, and the men swam back to shore where they were helped by a doctor and a nurse who happened to be on the shoreline.  Myers was composed until he realized he had survived a great white shark attack. He had only one word to describe that moment: "euphoria."  The physical damage caused by the shark was far less than it could have been. Myers has a cast on his left leg because his tendons were severed and 47 stitches on his right leg, where the teeth of the shark left several puncture wounds.  Great white sharks range from 12 to 21 feet and weigh nearly 3 tons. They are believed to live longer than 30 years.  Increased shark attacks: Is 'Jaws' back?

As it measures its response to the recent events on Egypt, the U.S. needs to be extremely careful about focusing on the definition of "coup" and the legitimacyor non-legitimacyof Mohamed Morsy's election, the draft constitution, and the now-ousted Egyptian president's efforts to give himself additional powers. It needs to be equally careful about focusing on the protests that helped drive him from power, and the legitimacy of political Islam.  If the U.S. focuses on whether or not a coup took place, it will be ignoring the fact that Egypt is a key center of the Middle East and that U.S. policy will be judged by its success in meeting the needs of Egypt's people. Egypt is a nation whose problems go far deeper than the crisis that began January 2011.  As the Arab Human Development report made clear in 2009, former President Hosni Mubarak's rule had become steadily more ineffective, corrupt, and incapable of meeting the needs of Egypt's people long before 2011. He had been in power since October 1981, but the social and economic progress he made in his first decade in power had faded into a static, incompetent regime by 2005, and one that became steadily more corrupt and unable to meet the needs of Egypt's young and growing population.  The last two years have made the situation far worse in ways that affect every aspect of day-to-day life. Mubarak's fall tore down a fragile regime that mixed a state-driven economy with crony capitalism. It was a country with a bureaucracy that could barely function without a strong leader, one with no opposition parties that had real political experience or capability to govern, and whose "reformers" were (and still are) protesters with no capability to make real reforms.  Opinion: In Egypt, get ready for extremist backlash  The end result is that Egypt is not an abstract exercise in political theory. It is a nation of more than 85 million people, at least 25% of whom live in dire poverty, and where unemployment and underemployment can no longer be accurately estimated but have reached the crisis level. It is a nation with over 50% of its population under 25 years of age, and 31% under 14, but with an education system in breakdown and much of the infrastructure frozen or losing capacity.  Egypt's foreign reserves have dropped by more than 50% and it faces a crisis in getting loans from the International Monetary Fund. It is a nation where foreign investment has critically declined, tourist revenue has dropped sharply, where many small businesses have already collapsed, and many middle class Egyptians have lost their jobs and savings. Fuel and electric power are lacking, food subsidies are uncertain and sometimes failing, the currency is increasingly unstable, and crime has skyrocketed.  U.S. policy must focus on these realities, and not just politics. The U.S., in partnership with its allies, the World Bank and other international aid agencies institutions needs to support immediate Egyptian efforts to salvage the economy and bring economic reform. It needs to focus on bringing relief and stability. No Egyptian government can succeeddemocratic or notthat cannot meet the needs of the Egyptian people. Real political legitimacy is not determined by how a government is chosen, but by how well it can meet the needs of its people.  Opinion: Will Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood survive?  As for politics, the U.S. needs to work with other states to push Egypt's military to support the reforms that failed between early 2011 and Morsy's fall. This means a broad-based effort to agree on a constitution, the creation of real political parties, and help for protesters learning how to organize politically and focus on practical governance and reform. It means taking enough time for elections to be open, to include Islamic and more secular parties, and focusing on the same kind of mixed national government and consensus politics that seem to have emerged in Tunisia.  One test of a solution to a problem is that it does not make things even worse. Threatening Egypt's military, rigidly cutting off aid because of a "coup" under conditions where there is no credible replacement government, and standing aside as Egypt drifts towards internal collapse is not a strategy.  Letting today's celebration of Morsy's fall turn into civil conflict and political paralysis will be a moral and ethical failure on the part of the Obama administration and the Congress, one that will do the Egyptian people vast harm, cripple a key ally, and leave a legacy of lasting anger in both Egypt and the region.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony Cordesman.  
 I love helping others plan a trip to South Africa. Not only does it give me a sense of home-turf pride, it's a beautiful country to visit that's great at looking after tourists.  First, let's get a common misconception out of the way: Yes, there is a significant crime rate in some parts of the country, and you will need to be vigilant. But, the same can be said for almost any country worldwide.  On to the good stuff. South Africa is a beautifully diverse country, racially and geographically. That being said, it's important to have a travel plan before you go. My ideal South African vacation would include a lengthy stop in Cape Town (my home town), a drive up the Garden Route and a safari. That way you get a bit of all the country has to offer.  The mother city  The Cape Peninsula is characterized by a steep mountain range running down into the cool blue Atlantic. The most famous mountain in this range is called Table Mountain because it's flat like a table. To its left is Lion's Head and to its right is Devil's Peak. The view from the summit of Table Mountain is top of my list when visiting the Cape Town.  You can get up and down by hiking or taking the cable car. Lines are long, so if you're going during the day, get there early. I highly recommend taking a picnic up to the top an hour or so before sunset and taking the last car down. Cape Town is known for its red and orange skies at sundown, and Table Mountain provides the perfect panoramic view.  My best advice for people visiting Cape Town would be to group outings together by location. Cape Point is a bit of a drive away, but I find it well worth it to see where the cold Atlantic Ocean meets the warm Indian Ocean. Just be mindful of the baboonsthey're cheeky! It's easy to stop in Simonstown, Kalk Bay or even Fish Hoek for lunch or a snack on the way back. The Brass Bell and the Black Marlin are two local eateries that have stunning views.  A visit to Robben Island is also likely to take a whole day. Book a ferry ticket in advance and be sure to check the weather report. Visiting this island, which was used as a prison for centuries, is very humbling and shouldn't be missed. Nelson Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island for 18 years.  Another interesting day trip is an outing to the wine farms. See whether your hotel can organize a driver for you. I love Fairview, which has a great restaurant and affordable wines. They also have a goat pen to entertain children, and of course, delicious goat cheese available for tasting with your wine. Some other well-known vineyards include Spier, Thelema, Delaire Graff, Delheim, Asara and Zevenwacht.  I also like visiting the small university town of Stellenbosch. Its quaint, tree-lined streets provide some shelter from the heat, and it's a great place to stop for coffee or a meal on your way back to the city. Can you tell South Africans like to eat?  Back in the city, it's really worth it to check out some local flavors. Greenmarket Square is in the middle of the central business district and is a great place to find some authentic carvings and crafts. There are plenty of great places to eat there, too. Try Mama Africa or Africa Caf if you're looking for strictly African food.  Long Street usually starts buzzing as the sun goes down. Running the length of downtown Cape Town, Long Street is home to backpacker lodges, hip clothing boutiques, funky restaurants and amazing night life.  Exploring outside the city  Once you've had your fill of the Cape Town area, take a drive up the Garden Route. This stretch of highway runs up South Africa's eastern coast and is well-known for its breathtaking views and whale-watching vantages.  Completing the trek in three or four days gives you ample time to stop as you want along the way. For overnight destinations, I recommend Cape Agulhas (to say you've been to the southernmost tip of Africa), Knysna (great for whale watching if you're there in the spring) and Plettenberg Bay.  There are beautiful beaches along this stretch of coastline, as well as lush rainforests and winding mountain passes. For the more adventurous, bungee jumping off the Bloukrans Bridge is a mustit's the tallest bridge jump in the world!  As for the safari portion, Addo Elephant National Park boasts all the big five (elephant, rhino, lion, leopard, buffalo) and is conveniently at the end of the Garden Route. Alternatively, you could visit Kruger National Park. Arguably the country's most well-known game reserve, Kruger offers multiple accommodation options (ranging from camping to a fabulous lodge) and is well-prepared for tourists.  If you'd prefer to do something a little more intimate, Phinda, Hluhluwe-Umfolozi and Sabi Sands are beautiful. The best way to see game is on drives. Most parks offer drives early morning or at sunset. Dress warmly if you're going in the morning and take bug spray if you're going at night. Another way to observe the wildlife is at a watering hole. Most parks have huts or viewing areas around big holes where you can watch animals undisturbed.  South Africans are a very friendly and helpful bunch. We love helping people, especially tourists, and if you enjoy something along the way, we'll likely ask you to tell your friends back home. Take your time while traveling. we tend to move pretty slowly, but it means we enjoy every moment and I hope you'll do the same.

Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that the Justice Department's civil rights investigation of Cleveland's police department found that it engaged in a "pattern or practice" of unreasonable and unnecessary use of force.  Coming on the heels of the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot and killed by a Cleveland police officer, many have wondered if this conclusion and damning report proves anything about Rice's death.  Not directly.  But this report doesn't exactly help the public's perception of the Cleveland police, either.  To many, the involvement of the federal government in investigating the killings of Rice, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner are a welcome event. After all, federal law enforcement does not have the intimate working relationship that local state investigators likely have with the police forcea relationship that could compromise an internal investigation.  The federal government is designed as a limited government. There is supposed to be no general federal "police power"that is, no right of the federal government to regulate for the health, safety, or general welfare of the citizenry. The reality is, legislation and court decisions over the past century have gradually expanded the federal government's control and review of local activities.  In these cases, authority to review the practices of law enforcement agencies potentially violating federal rights comes from the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  And the DOJ is increasingly vigilant in enforcing these laws. In just the last five years, the Civil Rights Division initiated more than 20 investigations of police departments, which it claims is more than twice as many investigations than were opened in the previous five fiscal years. It would seem that the modern DOJ has made civil rights a priority.  (The Cleveland police said in a statement they've begun remedial measures and "much more work is needed.")  The Cleveland report itself is almost chilling in its detailed narration of specific instances of excessive police force. But that's not all: The reported procedures, policies, and tactics are also equally as concerning. Among the findings:  1. 'Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice ... '  Would you be surprised to learn that the DOJ previously investigated the CDP in 2002 and found similar deficiencies? How about the fact that in 2004, the Justice Department and CDP entered into an agreement to correct these problems, including revising its use of force policy and establishing new procedures foryou guessed itreviewing officer-involved shootings.  However, that prior agreement was not enforced by a court and had no independent monitor. Here's where the DOJ appears to engage in some subtle CYA, when it writes that in 2005, "we found that Cleveland had abided by that agreement and it was terminated."  In the next sentence, the DOJ adds: "It is clear, however, that despite these measures, many of the policy and practice reforms (from the) 2004 memorandum agreement were either not fully implemented or ... not maintained over time."  So was the Cleveland force compliant in 2005? Or did the CDP just Jedi-mind-trick the Justice Department about the force, and convince DOJ to move along?  2. 'Beyond a reasonable doubt' is not a two-way street  Apparently investigators in CDP's Internal Affairs Unit only find violations of division policy if the evidence against the officer proves misconduct beyond a reasonable doubt. According to the Justice Department, this is an unreasonably high standard reserved for criminal prosecutions and inappropriate for internal police investigations.  Not surprisingly, discipline is comparatively rare at the CDP. Only a small fraction of officers were disciplined in connection with a use of force incident over more than a three year period. The Cleveland Plain Dealer analyzed similar CDP force data in 2007, finding that out of 4,427 uses of force over four years, supervisors justified the force in 100% of those cases.  3. It's the little things ...  This is a minor detail, but a potentially divisive one. The DOJ observed a sign hanging in a district station identifying it as a "forward operating base," which is a military term for an outpost in a war zone. People sympathetic to law enforcement might say "no big dealthat's part of police culture." To other members of the community and to the Justice Department, this is disturbing evidence of police culture: that CDP is more of an occupying army than a community partner.  4. What documents?  Were this not such a serious matter, the DOJ would LOL at CDP's document retention and production. The Cleveland department failed to produce deadly force investigations that occurred after April of 2013. CDP failed for some time to produce certain 2012 use of less lethal force reports. CDP failed to provide dozens of additional Internal Affairs investigations. It failed to provide final dispositions for every civilian complaint, including complaints filed two years ago. It failed to provide Taser firing histories.  Should I go on? If document-shredding Enron were still around today, even they would say of CDP's document retention policy: "Come on, guys. Get it together."  5. Basic mistakes and failures  The report found tactical errors and a failure to follow basic, generally accepted techniques for responding to an armed suspect. In one such case in 2011, officers failed to control the scene, failed to designate locations from which officers could seek cover and contain the threat, failed to use a negotiator, and grouped together with little or no cover.  Look for critics to point to these findings as support for the proposition that the CDP's response to the Rice call was bungled.  These are just a sampling of the findings by the Justice Department. The actual report contains other procedural concerns and is worth a long read.  DOJ and Cleveland have now committed to developing a consent decree. This time, it will include an independent monitor and be court-enforceable.  In the past several months citizens have repeatedly demanded, and expected, the intervention of federal law enforcement in these alleged cases of excessive force. This shows how embedded the idea of federal review is among the public.  But the Constitution never provided for the federal government to review local police practicesthat jurisdiction was created by Congress, and really not that long ago.  If not for that legislation, the police would ultimately only be policed ... by the police.  
 Sanaa, Yemen Hurling rocks and brandishing daggers and sticks, supporters of longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh plunged into a crowd calling for his ouster in Sanaa on Friday as rising momentum in Yemen sprouted similar protests in other towns.  Reports of excessive force prompted calls for restraint amid intensifying demonstrations.  U.S. President Barack Obama voiced concern about what the U.S. Embassy in Yemen described as "a disturbing rise in the number and violence of attacks against Yemeni citizens gathering peacefully to express their views on the current political situation."  "The United States condemns the use of violence by governments against peaceful protestors," Obama said. "Wherever they are, people have certain universal rights, including the right of peaceful assembly."  The embassy statement said "the attacks are contrary to the commitments that President Saleh has made to protect the right of Yemeni citizens to gather peacefully to express their views."  The violence in Yemen and Libya on Friday stood in sharp contrast to images from Cairo's Tahrir Square, where Egyptians showed up en masse to celebrate the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak a week ago.  Saleh's foes in Yemen are trying to score their own victory. After midday prayers concluded, they marched from the gates of Sanaa University to the streets, where security forces and riot police tried to stay between rival demonstrators Friday.  Some told Amnesty International that they had been surrounded by security forces, aided by "thugs" who fired shots at them and beat them.  "We are very scared, particularly because there are children with us," a protester told the human rights monitoring group.  "We've tried to get the children out of the area, but the security forces have not allowed us to do so."  "After Mubarak, now it's Ali's turn," chanted the anti-government protesters. "The people want the fall of the regime."  "I'm out here today because we want the president to go and we want to make sure that he and his family don't stay in power," said Khalid Amer, a student.  Despite concessions from Saleh, a tide of anger is sweeping through Yemen's youths, who say they are simply fed up with the status quo.  At least 30 anti-government demonstrators were injured, according to Abdul Naser Al-Dumaini, an anti-government protester at a demonstration in Sanaa.  The day before, at least 20 people were injured in Sanaa. Opposition lawmaker Ahmed Hashid said police at the scene did not try to intervene.  In Taiz, more than 10,000 anti-government demonstrators, including 4,000 women, gathered Friday in Freedom Square in a seventh straight day of protests, witnesses said. An assailant drove by the square and hurled a grenade, killing one person, a police official said. At least 43 others were wounded.  And in the coastal city of Aden, about 3,000 anti-government demonstrators gathered in the Al-Mansoura District, witnesses said. Five people have been killed in Aden since Wednesday, hospital and government officials said.  Aref al-Qubati, a participant whose friend was one of the victims, said police fired to disperse protesters.  The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that "at least four photojournalists were attacked, beaten and had their cameras confiscated" by government supporters at the protests.  The government countered the coverage of discontent in Yemen by reporting on sympathetic demonstrations. The state-run Saba news agency said a million demonstrators had marched in Taiz, hoisting Yemeni flags and pictures of Saleh. And Deputy Interior Minister Hussein al-Zawa'ari blamed a southern secessionist movement for the unrest and deaths in Aden, Saba said.  Saleh has called for an investigation into the Aden violence, and Vice President Abdu Rabo Mansour Hadi met with the governor Thursday, Saba said.  Saleh, in power for 32 years, met earlier in the week with his National Defense Council to discuss discontent in his nation. The council "stressed all should practice their rights according to the constitution, in a peaceful way and without violence, chaos, sabotage and lawbreaking," Saba said.  Saleh has been in touch with King Hamad of Bahrain, which is also mired in unrest.  "He pointed out that there are schemes aimed at plunging the region into chaos and violence targeting the nation's security and the stability of its countries," Saba said. "Those who commit acts of disorder and vandalism (are) simply implementing suspicious foreign agendas ..."  The report didn't suggest who might be behind the agendas.  In an attempt to quell growing discontent, Saleh, a U.S. ally in the fight against an offshoot of al Qaeda in Yemen, has announced he won't seek another term in 2013. He also said he would postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for April to allow more time for discussions about reform.  Yemen's situation is compounded by the fight against al Qaeda, the southern separatist movement in its once-independent south, a Shiite uprising and a looming shortage of water.

The past year saw a mild winter give way to a balmier-than-normal spring, followed by a sweltering summer and high temperatures that lingered into the fall, all punctuated by extreme drought and intense storms.  Now 2012 is officially in the books as the hottest year on record for the continental United States and the second-worst for "extreme" weather such as hurricanes, droughts or floods, the U.S. government announced Tuesday.  The year's average temperature of 55.3 degrees Fahrenheit across the Lower 48 was more than 3.2 degrees warmer than the average for the 20th century, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration reported. That topped the previous record, set in 1998, by a full degree.  Every state in the contiguous United States saw above-average temperatures in 2012, with 19 of them setting annual records of their own, NOAA said. Meanwhile, the country faced 11 weather disasters that topped $1 billion in losses each, including a lingering drought that covered 61% of the country at one point.  That drought shriveled crops across the American farm belt, leading to an expected rise in food prices in 2013, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. It also turned forests of the mountain West into stands of tinder that exploded into catastrophic wildfires over the summer, scorching millions of acres and destroying hundreds of homes.  Climate change, extreme weather linked  And then there was Superstorm Sandy, a late October post-tropical cyclone that killed more than 110 people in the United States and nearly 70 more in the Caribbean and Canada. Damage estimates from the storm run around $80 billion in New York and New Jersey alone.  The report is likely to fuel new concerns over a warming climate. Seven of the 10 hottest years in U.S. records, which date back to 1895, and four of the hottest five have now occurred since 1990, according to NOAA figures.  The year also saw Arctic sea ice hit a record low in more than 30 years of satellite observations and studies that found the world's major ice sheets have been shrinking at an increasing rate.  Scientists are quick to point out that no single storm can be blamed on climate change, but say a warming world raises the odds of extreme weather.  "I think unfortunately, 2012 really may well be the new normal," said Daniel Lashof, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. environmental group. "It's the kind of year we expect, given the global warming trend is ongoing."  The science of global warming is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most researchers, who point to heat-trapping carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels as the major cause.  Lashof's group is trying to press the Obama administration to tighten limits on carbon emissions, but he said those steps "are not going to reduce the threat of extreme weather overnight."  "We need to take greater preparations, anticipating the kind of storms and droughts that we saw are going to continue to be more frequent as we go forward," he said.  Wildfires race across Australia  Though parts of the country such as the Pacific Northwest and the Gulf Coast had wetter-than-average years, average precipitation was nearly 2.6 inches below normalthe 15th driest since records started being kept in the 1890s, according to NOAA.  The two remaining U.S. states, remote Alaska and Hawaii, saw a mixed picture in 2012.  Alaska was slightly cooler and wetter than normal, while nearly two-thirds of Hawaii's island chain faced moderate to exceptional drought conditions by December, NOAA said.

 Add Heart to the list of bands that are bowing out of a show at SeaWorld because of the CNN documentary "Blackfish."  "Heart has chosen to decline their forthcoming performance at SeaWorld on 2/9/14 due to the controversial documentary film 'Black Fish,'" the band said Sunday on its verified Twitter account.  Sisters Nancy and Ann Wilson did not elaborate.  But the duo isn't the first to cancel a concert at the Florida theme park because of the film.  Country singer Willie Nelson and Canadian rock act Barenaked Ladies also pulled the plug on their shows.  "While we're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld by Heart, Barenaked Ladies and Willie Nelson,we respect the bands' decisions," SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck told CNN on Sunday.  Nelson: 'What they do at SeaWorld is not OK'  The documentarywhich first aired on CNN in Octobertells the story of the killing in 2010 of experienced SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by a 12,000-pound orca.  The film raises questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity over the past 39 years.  Moved by the documentary, fans started online petitions asking musicians to stay away.  'Blackfish' sparks debate over taking kids to animal parks  When the Barenaked Ladies nixed their plans last week to play at SeaWorld, they explained that it was a decision made after viewing "Blackfish."  "This is a complicated issue, and we don't claim to understand all of it, but we don't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time," the band said in a Facebook post.  When SeaWorld's Gollattscheck confirmed Nelson's decision not to sing at SeaWorld, he cited "scheduling conflicts," but Nelson said it was because of the documentary and petition.  "I don't agree with the way they treat their animals," Nelson told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. "It wasn't that hard a deal for me."  SeaWorld said it would like the musical artists to learn for themselves about SeaWorld.  "The bands and artists have a standing invitation to visit any of our parks to see firsthand or to speak to any of our animal experts to learn for themselves how we care for animals and how little truth there is to the allegations made by animal extremist groups opposed to the zoological display of marine mammals," Gollattscheck said.  SeaWorld says the documentary ignores the park's conservation efforts and research.  "'Blackfish' focuses on a handful of incidents over our long history at the exclusion of everything else," wrote Michael Scarpuzzi, vice president for zoological operations at San Diego SeaWorld, in an op-ed on CNN.com. "Not a single interview with a guest who was inspired and enriched by their experience with killer whales at SeaWorld. Not one visitor who left SeaWorld more aware of the need to preserve the world around them. Not one word about the thousands of ill, orphaned and injured animals rescued by SeaWorld or the millions of dollars we dedicate to supporting conservation and research."

New York When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York.  A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.  Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again.  Then, Barrientos declared "I do" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other.  In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her "first and only" marriage.  Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of "offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree," referring to her false statements on the 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents. Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam.  On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further.  After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman.  In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.  All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx.  She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say.  Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.  Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted.  The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney's Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called "red-flagged" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali.  Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.  If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.  Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.  
 More state restrictions on fishing in the Gulf of Mexico were lifted Monday as the fall shrimping season began, but efforts to permanently plug the ruptured BP oil well were delayed again.  The worst oil spill in U.S. history has hobbled fishermen across the Gulf as federal and state authorities put much of its waters off-limits due to safety concerns. With the well capped on a temporary basis for a month, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the Gulf states have begun lifting those restrictionsbut Louisiana shrimpers like Anthony Bourgeoif say more needs to be done, and soon.  "It's open down over here with small shrimp, where it should be open over there where the big shrimp are," Bourgeoif told CNN. "Can't make no money with no little shrimp, man."  Bourgeoif said he planned to go out, because "I ain't made nothing since the BP spill." But he was concerned that inspectors might find signs of oil in his catch and make him dump it.  "So why go out there and catch it if they're just going to be dumped, and I ain't going to make no money off it?" he asked. "I've got to make money. I've got four grandkids I'm raising, man."  Deborah Long, a spokeswoman for the Southern Shrimp Alliance, said it will likely take days to assess what impact the spill has had on the Gulf catch. And while some shrimpers are eager to get back out, many are still working for the well's owner, BP, which has hired many boats to skim oil off the surface and lay protective booms along the shorelines.  And concerns about the long-term impact of the spill persisted with a new report from researchers at the University of South Florida, who reported that oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill may have settled to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico further east than previously suspectedand at levels toxic to marine life.  Initial findings from a new survey of the Gulf conclude that dispersants may have sent droplets of crude to the ocean floor, where it has turned up at the bottom of an undersea canyon within 40 miles of the Florida Panhandle. The results are scheduled to be released Tuesday, but CNN obtained a summary of the initial conclusions Monday night.  Plankton and other organisms at the base of the food chain showed a "strong toxic response" to the crude, and the oil could well up onto the continental shelf and resurface later, according to researchers.  "The dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters, where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life," said John Paul, a marine microbiologist at USF.  The spill erupted April 20 with an explosion that sank the offshore drilling platform Deepwater Horizon. The blast killed 11 men and uncapped an undersea gusher that spewed an estimated 205 million gallons of oil into the Gulf before it was temporarily shut in July 15.  Thad Allen, the federal government's point man in the Gulf, said Monday that attempts to permanently seal the well won't start until the latest potential problem is evaluated. Allen said engineers are now concerned about how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus, a ring that surrounds the casing pipe at the center of the well shaft.  The "timelines won't be known until we get a recommendation on the course of action," Allen said.  Scientists began new pressure tests last week to gauge the effects of the mud and cement poured into the well from above during the "static kill" procedure that started August 3. From those pressure readings, they believe that either some of the cement breached the casing pipe and leaked into the annulus, or cement came up into the annulus from the bottom.  The scientists believe that process may have trapped some oil between the cement and the top of the well, inside the annulus. Now, given that new variable, they're trying to figure out how to safely maintain the pressure within the well before launching the "bottom kill," a procedure aimed at sealing the well from below.  Allen told reporters that when it comes to giving a green light to the "bottom kill" of the well through the nearby relief well, "nobody wants to make that declaration any more than I do." But the process "will not start until we figure out how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus."  "We're using an overabundance of caution," he said.  Allen said crews could remove the capping stack that sealed the oil in the well on July 15, then replace the well's blowout preventer with a new one stored on the nearby Development Driller II in the Gulf. Allen said a new blowout preventer would be "rated at much higher pressure levels than the annulus."  The other option would require BP to devise a pressure-relief device for the current capping stack.  Once crews get their marching orders, it will take them about 96 hours to prepare, drill the final 50 feet of a relief well and intercept the main well. Then, the bottom kill process of plugging the well from below would begin.  BP acknowledged Monday that the disruption the oil spill has caused to lives across the Gulf coast has built up tension among residents.  In response, the company announced Monday it is providing a total of $52 million to five behavioral health support and outreach programs.  BP released a statement saying it would give the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration $10 million; the Florida Department of Children and Families, $3 million; the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, $15 million; and the departments of mental health in Mississippi and Alabama, $12 million each.  "We appreciate that there is a great deal of stress and anxiety across the region, and as part of our determination to make things right for the people of the region, we are providing this assistance now to help make sure individuals who need help know where to turn," said Lamar McKay, president of BP America and incoming leader of BP's Gulf Coast Restoration Organization.  CNN's Vivian Kuo, Reynolds Wolf, Ed Lavandera, Rich Phillips, Matt Smith and Chris Turner contributed to this report.

Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates An Emirati blogger who has called for reform in the United Arab Emirates is being held in Al Wathba prison in Abu Dhabi, his wife said Wednesday  Ahmed Mansoor is being treated well, according to wife Nadia, who said she spoke to him Tuesday evening.  Mansoor's attorney, Abdul Hamid Al Kumity, said he is not aware of any charges against his client, but will meet with the prosecutor's office Wednesday.  Dubai police have told Al Kumity that two bottles of whiskey were found in Mansoor's house. Alcohol is available at hotels and select stores in the UAE, but Muslims are not allowed to buy or possess it.  Mansoor's wife acknowledged that here was alcohol in their house, but said they don't drink. The alcohol, in a small unopened box, was probably a gift from friends or family, she said.  About 10 men, including two wearing police uniforms, picked up Mansoor from his apartment Friday afternoon, according to his wife.  The men also took Mansoor's passport and laptop and left without telling her where they were taking him or why.  Fahad Salem al-Shehhi, a friend of Mansoor's who helped him with his website, was detained Saturday evening, said activist Mohammed al-Mansoori. Al-Shehhi was taken from the Emirate of Ajman, where he was living temporarily while his wife studies there, al-Mansoori said. Al-Shehhi has been without a passport for seven years, he said.  The third, Nasser bin Ghaith, an Emirati writer who also maintains a website, was detained Sunday, al-Mansoori said.  Officials in the UAE have not responded to persistent queries regarding the detentions. Mansoor has no criminal record or prior incidences with the law, according to Al Kumity.  Mansoor was part of a group of 133 nationals who petitioned the president on March 9 for direct elections. The group included academics, former government officials, journalists and activists.  The petition was addressed to President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and the members of the Supreme Council of the seven Emirates that form the UAE.  In addition to elections, the group asked that the Federal National Council be granted legislative powers. The body only works in an advisory capacity and has no regulatory powers.  
 A leading international children's charity has warned that Elton John's desire to adopt a 14-month-old baby boy could lead to more children being abandoned.  Elton John kisses baby Lev during his visit to the orphanage in Ukraine on Saturday.  The singer, 62, made the announcement during a visit with his partner, 46-year-old David Furnish, to an orphanage for HIV-affected children in Ukraine on Saturday.  "David always wanted to adopt and I always said no because I am 62 and I think because of the traveling I do and the life I have, maybe it wouldn't be fair for the child," he told reporters.  "But having seen Lev today, I would love to adopt him. I don't know how we do that but he has stolen my heart. And he has stolen David's heart and it would be wonderful if we can have a home. I've changed my mind today."  While EveryChild praised the British musician for helping raise awareness of children affected by HIV/AIDS, it said international adoption is sending out the wrong message.  James Georgalakis, EveryChild's Communications and Advocacy Manager, told CNN: "Research conducted in the Ukraine in 2007 which showed high-profile celebrity adoptions and news around foreigners coming into the country and adopting children generally was actually encouraging vulnerable young mothers to abandon their children into homes hoping their child would be adopted by a rich foreigner and have a better life.  "So it's quite well documented that these high-profile adoptions could actually be increasing the number of children in institutions." Do you think celebrity adoptions are a good thing?  According to research by the charity's Web site, 95 percent of the children in Ukraine's institutions are not orphans, with babies born to HIV+ mothers facing particular discrimination. They are separated from their mothers and often end up in children's homes and institutions segregated from children not affected by HIV.  It argues that governments such as Ukraine need to be encouraged to put more emphasis on keeping families together rather than placing them in outdated Soviet-era children's homes.  "After a great deal of campaigning by charities such as ours, the Ukraine government introduced a new 'gate-keeping' system which means the authorities will have to consider all available options before a child is placed in an institution," Georgalakis said.  "So when a child is taken into care or abandoned, they will have look at whether a child has other family or can be fostered by another family for example. This is a huge step forward and one that needs support.  "We will definitely be speaking to Elton and his representatives about this."  Elton John is the latest high-profile figure to be linked with a case of this kind. Earlier this year, Madonna won a court appeal to adopt a second child from Malawi. Critics of the pop-star accused the pop superstar of taking advantage of "archaic adoption laws" in a bid to adopt three-year-old Chifundo James.  Madonna's initial attempt was denied because she did not meet a residency law that requires applicants to have lived in the country for some time before adoption. This condition was waived when Madonnaand then husband Guy Ritchieadopted her first Malawian child, David Banda.  The judge in that case said the interest of the child outweighed the issue of residency.  Meanwhile, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering said around 4,000 children need to be adopted in UK each year, with many facing a considerable wait.  BAAF Chief Executive David Holmes told CNN: "While Elton John may be considered too old under current guidance to adopt a baby in the UK, there are many children, particularly older children, sibling groups, children with disabilities, and children from black minority groups, all waiting for a family.  "We'll certainly be reinforcing this message during National Adoption Week in Britain later this year."

The peanut processing company at the heart of a national salmonella outbreak, Peanut Corp. of America, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation in court Friday in Lynchburg, Virginia.  Peanut Corp. of America plants in Georgia and Texas came under scrutiny after the salmonella outbreak.  The documents were filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Western District of Virginia.  The bankruptcy papers were signed by Stewart Parnell, the president of Peanut Corp., who invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions this week in a congressional hearing.  Bacteria found in the company's Blakely, Georgia, peanut processing plant have been blamed for more than 600 cases of salmonella, including nine deaths.  Watch how bankruptcy could affect case   The Texas Health Department on Thursday ordered products from the company's plant in Plainview, Texas, to be recalled after discovering dead rodents, rodent excrement and bird feathers in the plant.  Watch what health inspectors found   A call to the company's telephone number, which was working earlier this week, elicited a recording that said it was no longer in service.  "The long and the short of it is that we kicked the tires on reorganizing the company, and, frankly, they're just in a position now where they can't even conduct business," said Andrew S. Goldstein, a lawyer for the company. "They can't operate at all, and this just seemed like the inevitable course."  In a written statement, Consumers Union said Friday's declaration shows that Congress needs to strengthen the Food and Drug Administration and hike the penalties it can impose.  "It is unacceptable for corporations to put consumers' health at risk and then simply declare bankruptcy and go out of business when they get caught," said Jean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives at Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports.  "PCA's declaration of bankruptcy will, among other things, shield it from liability suits filed by consumers who became sick or whose loved ones died as a result of eating PCA's peanut products," she said.  
 To most owners of the new iPhone, the voice-activated feature called Siri is more than a virtual "assistant" who can help schedule appointments, find a good nearby pizza or tell you if it's going to rain.  She's also a she.  Siri answers questions in a part-human, part-robot voice that's deep, briskly efficient and distinctly female. (At least in the U.S. and four other countries. In France and the UK, Siri is male.)  People describe the app using female pronouns. Her gender has even prompted some users to flood blogs and online forums with sexually suggestive questions for Siri such as "What are you wearing?" (Siri's baffled response: "Why do people keep asking me this?")  The fuss over Siri's sex also raises a larger question: From voice-mail systems to GPS devices to Siri and beyond, why are so many computerized voices female?  One answer may lie in biology. Scientific studies have shown that people generally find women's voices more pleasing than men's.  "It's much easier to find a female voice that everyone likes than a male voice that everyone likes," said Stanford University Professor Clifford Nass, author of "The Man Who Lied to His Laptop: What Machines Teach Us About Human Relationships." "It's a well-established phenomenon that the human brain is developed to like female voices."  Research suggests this preference starts as early as the womb, Nass said. He cites a study in which fetuses were found to react to the sound of their mother's voice but not to other female voices. The fetuses showed no distinct reaction to their father's voice, however.  Another answer lies in history. According to some sources, the use of female voices in navigation devices dates back to World War II, when women's voices were employed in airplane cockpits because they stood out among the male pilots. And telephone operators have traditionally been female, making people accustomed to getting assistance from a disembodied woman's voice.  When automakers were first installing automated voice prompts in cars ("your door is ajar") decades ago, their consumer research found that people overwhelmingly preferred female voices to male ones, said Tim Bajarin, a Silicon Valley analyst and president of Creative Strategies Inc.  This may explain why in almost all GPS navigation systems on the market, the default voice is female. One notable exception has been Germany, where BMW was forced to recall a female-voiced navigation system on its 5 Series cars in the late 1990s after being flooded with calls from German men saying they refused to take directions from a woman.  "Cultural stereotypes run deep," said Nass, who details the BMW episode in his book.  Voice casting  Most companies that produce automated voices hold auditions for voice actors and collect recordings of them speaking. Then they invite focus groups to listen to the recordings and rate the voices on how well they convey certain attributes: warmth, friendliness, competence and so on.  "It's casting," Nass said. "It's something Hollywood has known for a long, long time."  Look no further than examples of automated or artificial-intelligence voices in sci-fi movies and TV shows. Voices of authority or menace tend to be male: the homicidal HAL 9000 computer in "2001: A Space Odyssey," the computer program in "WarGames," or Auto, the spaceship's autopilot function in "Wall-E." More subservient talking machines, such as the onboard computer from the "Star Trek" TV series, skew female.  Bajarin, the Silicon Valley analyst, believes that more computerized voices would be masculine if not for the associations with HAL, whose malicious intent in the 1968 Stanley Kubrick film was made even creepier by his soothing tone.  "A lot of tech companies stayed away from the male voice because of HAL," he said. "I've heard that theory tossed around multiple times." (One prominent exception: The chipper "You've got mail!" voice from AOL's dial-up days.)  When it comes to consumer applications of computerized voices, the sex of the voice is usually determined by what service or product is employing it. For example, transit systems such as the San Francisco Area's BART often use higher-pitched voices because they are easier to hear over the clatter of the train cars.  Nuance, a Massachusetts-based company that develops speech technologies for Ford vehicles' SYNC system, Amazon e-readers and other clients, creates both male and female voices. It's then up to the client to choose which voice, and gender, best fits their product, said chief creative officer Gary Clayton.  "As these products become part of our everyday lives, there's a huge opportunity for personalization," added Brant Ward, the company's director of advanced speech design. "I could have an approximation of my wife's voice read me a text message in my car."  Siri: Brilliant or sexist?  Siri, the iPhone 4S's voice, grew from a five-year research project that was funded by military agency DARPA and led by SRI International, a Bay Area research institute. The project spawned a company, also called Siri, that launched an iPhone app in February 2010 and was acquired by Apple two months later.  That original Siri voice-to-text apppowered in part by Nuance's technologyalso worked by people speaking commands into their phones, although it didn't talk back. And it had no gender. In fact, the app was originally conceived to speak in a gender-neutral voice, said Norman Winarsky, vice president of SRI and a co-founder of Siri.  "What Apple did is absolutely brilliant," said Winarsky, who calls speech "the most natural of all human interfaces."  "They took Siri and gave it more of a personality," he said. "It's the first real artificial intelligence working in millions of people's hands."  An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on why the company gave Siri a female voice in the U.S. Nor would she say why Siri speaks like a man in the UK, where iPhone 4S owners have swarmed online forums to request a female voice instead. "Eww!! Hope UK gets female voice soon," wrote one commenter. "I don't think anyone in the US cares about male voice option."  Many GPS devices and computer text-to-speech programs now offer multiple voice options. And someday soon, voice-technology experts say, Siri will probably speak in a variety of voices, too.  Until then, some bloggers have wondered: Are computerized female "assistants" sexist?  Not necessarily, said Rebecca Zorach, director of the Social Media Project at the University of Chicago's Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality.  "I think they have to be understood in a broader context in which they're one small piece," she wrote in an e-mail to CNN. "Voices intended to convey authority (such as voice-over narration in films) tend to be male. So yes, probably these compliant female robot voices reinforce gender stereotypes, not just because they serve the user but because the technology itself is about communication and relationships (areas that women are presumed to be good at).  "I wouldn't automatically claim any sexism in individual companies' choices, though. Most such decisions are probably the result of market research, so they may be reflecting gender stereotypes that already exist in the general public."  Zorach listened to some sound clips of Siri online, then e-mailed back again.  "What's interesting to me is how they seem to intentionally make her speech sound artificialthey could choose to make her speech more seamless and human-like, but they choose instead to highlight the technology," she said. "That makes you aware of how high-tech your gadget is."

Talks aimed at ending 50 years of fighting between FARC guerrillas and Colombian forces are expected to take place Wednesday in Norway.  In an interview last month, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he was hopeful about the prospect for peace. The sides were able to negotiate a "short" and "pragmatic" agenda for the talks, he said.  Santos said he has been thinking about the possibility of peace ever since the FARC's military commander was killed in 2010.  Read more: Five facts about Colombia's FARC rebels  A developing economy and the military successes Colombia has scored against the FARC make it a good time for negotiations, according to Santos.  After starting in Oslo, the talks will move to Havana, Cuba.  Peace talks between the rebelsthe Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARCand the government have occurred sporadically since the 1980s. The last attempt fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to the guerrilla group but ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position.  The two sides have been at war since the 1960s, making it Latin America's oldest insurgency.  Santos said the group must be permitted to participate in the political process.  Read more: FARC ready to lay down arms if government does, members say  "You can't ask the FARC to simply kneel down, surrender and give us the arms," Santos said. "They will not do that, so there has to be some kind of way out, and this way out has to be you can be able to participate in the political arena. This is a way any conflict is settled, not only the Colombian conflict."  Yet, the president has said their will be no cease-fire while the two sides are in talks, though the rebels have said they would ask for one.  "I've told them there will be cease-fire and we will stop any military operation when we reach a final agreement," Santos said. "And if I see that there's no progress, that they are simply trying to buy time, I will stand up and continue business as usual. And that's why there's no cease-fire, no decrease in our military operations, and my government agenda will continue as it was until then."  Read more: Colombian rebels free French journalist  The rebels continue to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces, though it has been severely weakened in recent years, thanks in part to a U.S.-backed security campaign.  U.S. officials praised news of the talks.  "President Obama welcomes President Santos' deep commitment to working for peace and recognizes the courage and sacrifice of successive Colombian governmentsand most especially of the Colombian peoplein achieving this milestone," the White House said in September. "The FARC should now take this opportunity to end its decades of terrorism and narcotics trafficking, and allow the Colombian people to continue building a democratic, prosperous and just society."

 The drummer for the Scorpions rock band has been sentenced to a month in jail for being drunk, insulting Muslims and lowering his trousers at Dubai International Airport, local media reported.  James Kottak, the band's 51-year-old American drummer, admitted to a Dubai court Tuesday that he had been drinking when he landed at the airport on April 3 on a flight from Moscow, court reporters from The National and Gulf News said.  The band was on its way to Bahrain for a concert for the Formula One Grand Prix.  Witnesses said that Kottak became angry and swore. One passenger services agent is quoted as telling the court that "he was shouting 'non-educated Muslims,' then he went to the office of the head and flashed his middle finger at the passengers."  Kottak admitted to drinking but denied making any insulting comments about Muslims and denied flashing his middle finger.  A policeman testified that Kottak shouted that he wouldn't travel with a group of Pakistanis and Afghans, saying they "smell," a claim Kottak denied. Witnesses also said Kottak removed his trousers, but his lawyer said he just raised his shirt to show off a tattoo.  Kottak's lawyer, named by The National as Hamid al-Khazraji, argued that his client was innocent and that testimony from witnesses was contradictory.  Dubai police confirmed the arrest but would not comment on details. Kottak "was arrested at the airport earlier this month after complaints about his behavior. He was then, according to the law, referred to the prosecution department," a Dubai police source told CNN Arabic.  The band made its first comment on the incident on its Facebook page Wednesday.  "When James Kottak arrived in Dubai at 3. april, he ran into problems at immigrations and got busted. whatever happened is totally out of our control and we don't know any details about it at this point," the post read.  Court reporters said Kottak will be deported within days after his jail term ends. The Gulf News described the sentence as "lenient."  The United Arab Emirates is a Muslim country, and while some licensed venues serve alcohol, the Government of Dubai Code of Conduct says that "being caught under the effect of alcohol" outside licensed venues, even in light doses, "can lead to a fine or incarceration."

Roger Federer is through to the semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals after beating Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro at London's O2 Arena on Saturday.  The Swiss World No.7 came from a set down and 3-0 down in the deciding set of the Group B match to eventually win through 4-6 7-6 7-5 in two hours and 26 minutes.  Federer, a six-time winner of the event, will now face World No.1 Rafael Nadal on Sunday for a place in Monday's final.  Read more: 'Thanks Rafa'  "It's something to look forward to," Federer said. "I don't even have a day off so I've got to back it up tomorrow, but I'm ready and I'm looking forward to a great matchup with him."  Swiss fans were out in force at the O2, but must have feared the worst in all three sets as their man struggled at times to cope with the power of the fourth seed.  Read more: Federer demands more drug testing  Federer trailed del Potro 5-1 in the opening set before mounting a mini-comeback to trail 5-4.

Trailing again in the second setthis time 3-1Federer once more sprang back into life taking 12 points in a row before eventually levelling the match in a tiebreak (7-2).  With the pattern firmly established, Federer duly went 3-0 down in the third before leveling the set three games later. Del Potro's resolve, and serve were broken in the 11th game which set up Federer to serve out the match which ended with a resounding ace.

I could never really play free-flowing tennis like I would have liked to if I would have been in the lead," Federer said.  The 17-time grand slam champion was quick to pay tribute to a "tough" and, in recent weeks, very familiar opponent.  The pair met in the final of the Basel tournament in Switzerland at the end of October with del Potro winning in three sets. Last weekend, it was Federer's turn to triumph in the quarters at the Paris Masters.  "I thought Juan Martin's done really well the whole season and also again today. It was a pleasure playing against him and unfortunately one guy had to win."  In the remaining Group B match, Novak Djokovic beat Richard Gasquet 7-6 (8-6) 4-6 6-3 to maintain his 100% record while consigning the Frenchman to his third straight defeat.  The Serb will face Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka in Sunday's other semifinal clash.  
 Britain's Queen Elizabeth II arrived in Northern Ireland Tuesday for a two-day diamond jubilee visit during which she will shake hands with a former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness, in a highly symbolic gesture.  She will meet McGuinness, now a Sinn Fein politician and the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, at an arts event in Belfast Wednesday.  The meeting is a sign of the significant easing of tensions in British-Irish relations since the Good Friday peace deal was signed in 1998. Ireland's President Michael Higgins will attend the same event.  On Tuesday, the queen was greeted in Enniskillenthe scene of a deadly IRA bombing in 1987by crowds lining the streets and waving Union flags.  She was greeted by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Owen Paterson, who accompanied her to a jubilee thanksgiving service at St. Macartin's Cathedral, an Anglican church, that was attended by more than 700 people.  She also went to a smaller service at St. Michael's Church in Enniskillen, a Catholic church.  Friday's confirmation that the queen would meet McGuinness prompted wide reaction in the UK media.  It follows the queen's visit to the Republic of Ireland in May of last year, which was seen as ushering in a new era in relations.  The meeting has an added significance for the queen because one of her relatives, Lord Mountbatten, was killed by an IRA bomb in 1979. IRA members have also killed police officers and soldiers in Northern Ireland, who serve in the queen's name.  The nationalist community in Northern Ireland sees the British as occupiers and wants their rule in the province to end.  Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams acknowledged the controversial nature of the handshake in a statement Friday.  "Because this involves Martin meeting the British monarch, this will cause difficulty for Republicans and nationalists who have suffered at the hands of British forces in Ireland over many decades," he said.  However, he said, the party had agreed that McGuinness should meet the queen "in the context of conflict resolution and national reconciliation, as well as our own republican national objectives."  The event is not connected with the queen's diamond jubilee celebrations, he said.  "This is a significant initiative involving major political and symbolic challenges for Irish republicans," Adams added.  "As the record of the peace process demonstrates, Irish republicans have frequently been prepared to take bold and historic initiatives and risks for peace to break stalemates and find agreements."  The Queen's 2011 visit to Ireland was the first by a British monarch to the republic since it gained independence in 1921 and marked a reconciliation between neighboring countries, which once viewed each other with suspicion and hostility.  McGuinness has admitted that he was a leader of the Provisional IRA during the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland between pro-British and pro-Irish forces.  In recent years, he has received death threats from hardline dissident IRA splinter groups because of his support for the peace process.  The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict, but six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland.  In the late 1960s the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and largely Roman Catholic nationalists who want the North to be reunited with the rest of Ireland exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles.  The three decades of ensuing violence between the IRA and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people, most of them north of the border, and while the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 effectively ended the conflict, suspicions remain.  Under the terms of the landmark accord, terrorist groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and political allies of the two now work together in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government.  CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.

Philadelphia Outside Independence Hall, ask a graduate student in line to see the Liberty Bell what he thinks of gerrymandering, and you might get this answer:  "I think Gerry Mandering is a great guy."  No, he isn't.  Gerrymandering is the term for the way politicians draw boundary lines for legislative districts in a way designed to keep one party or the other in power in that particular district.  In the last 10 years, 78% of the seats in the U.S. House of Representativesalmost four out of every five members of Congressdid not change party hands even once.  In California, with 53 seatsthe most in the nationincumbents were kept so safe that only one of those seats changed party control in the past decade.  David Wasserman, redistricting expert for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, says only 20 races for Congress are expected to be tossups in the 2012 election. That's only 20 out of the 435 seats in the House.  "In general elections, it's almost rigged," he said.  More on the history behind gerrymandering  The lines are redrawn for seats in Congress each 10 years after the U.S. Census measures population shifts. That process is going on now in states across the country.  Among CNN's findings:  The South  Race has been used to create a political divide in the South. In the five Deep Dixie statesSouth Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisianaonly nine Democrats are left in Congress. Only one is white. He is Georgia Democrat John Barrow, and Republican control in that state's legislature has led to his home city of Savannah being excluded from his current district.  In 2010, Republicans captured control of North Carolina's legislature for the first time since shortly after the Civil War. They drew district lines in a way to pack 49% of all of North Carolina's African-American voters in just three of the state's 13 congressional districts. That left the other 10 districts mostly white and predictably Republican.  Democrats in North Carolina accuse the GOP of political "resegregation." A court battle is looming.  Illinois  After the GOP landslide in 2010, this is the only battleground state winning or losing a seat where Democrats remain in control. They pushed through their new map over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. Most of the five freshmen Republicans elected to Congress last time will face difficult races to return for a second term.  Nowhere is gerrymandering more apparent than in Chicago's 4th District, where a grassy strip hardly a football field wide, stuck in between two expressways, connects the top and bottom halves of a district designed to keep a Hispanic in Congress.  According to the 4th District Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat, Chicago has an Irish district, a Polish district, a Jewish district and three black districts. Look at a map and all have irregular, unusual lines. This is not a matter of party control. All the incumbents are Democrats. The lines preserve racial and ethnic heritages.  In Illinois, it is the GOP that is suing Democrats to try to overturn the new map.  California  Voters have revolted. In 2010, they passed an amendment to the state constitution to take redistricting out of political hands and have a citizens commission redraw the lines. It was forbidden to favor incumbents.  As a result, more than half of California's 53 representatives were placed in the same district with another colleague for the 2012 election. As many as 15 could lose or else face retirement to avoid losing.  "Fifteen out of 53 does not sound like a lot," Wasserman said. "But compared to most other states, that's an avalanche."  Party politics did give way to social politics. Latinos, who accounted for most of California's population growth, could win as many as nine seats next year. The African-American population shrank, but under pressure, the citizens commission retained the three traditionally black seats in south Los Angeles.  Florida  Voter reform met resistance here. Three million people voted to pass amendments last year that say the legislature cannot not favor or penalize incumbents or political parties when it redraws the lines.  Two members of CongressDemocrat Corrine Brown, who is African-American, and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart, who is Hispanicfiled a lawsuit in federal court to try to overturn what the voters had done. Florida's House of Representatives, using taxpayer money, hired a law firm to support them in opposing the taxpayers' will. Their argument: The U.S. Constitution has given the legislature the sole responsibility for redistricting.  A federal judge rejected that argument and threw out the lawsuit. But the two incumbents, supported by the legislature, are appealing, and they say the case could go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Iowa  For three decades now, Iowa has had a nonpartisan redistricting system. Two legislative staffers draw the maps in secrecy without political interference. "In Iowa, it is understood incumbent protection is not the name of the game," one of those staffers said.  As a result, Iowa has the nation's only congressional race next year where a longtime Republican incumbent, Tom Latham, is paired against a longtime Democratic incumbent, Leonard Boswell. Past voting patterns indicate they could be separated by no more than 1%, either way.  Iowans like it this way, and that includes Latham. He said, "I think if you sit in a very safe district, a lot of times these people will ignore the public will. They won't have to listen because they can do whatever they want to, and vote however they want to, and not be held accountable for it."  As Wasserman put it, "Americans are basically between the ideological 40-yard lines. But the districts aren't. And that's part of the reason Congress is so polarized."  
 Sanaa, Yemen Government troops in southern Yemen on Sunday attacked al Qaeda hideouts, killing two dozen suspected militants in the latest push to clear the area of the terror organization, local security officials said.  Four members of the military were also killed in the clashes, which began early in the morning in the Abyan districts of Zinjibar and Jaar, the officials said, while nine troops were wounded.  Government warplanes aided in the assault.  "We succeeded in taking over three strategic posts near Jaar and our forces will continue to go forward," said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  "Al Qaeda fighters are evacuating areas previously under their control due to the intensive government bombardment," the official added.  Yemen's government has been fighting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for years with mixed results.  Suspected al Qaeda militants seized Abyan last year during Yemen's political stalemate after government troops evacuated most military posts in the province.  Recently, the government sent thousands of troops to Abyan in its latest assault against the militants, vowing not to retreat until al Qaeda is defeated.  The clashes took place the same day White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan met with President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi in Sanaa.  The two discussed efforts to eradicate al Qaeda and build a "modern civil state," according to a statement from the Yemeni Embassy in Washington.  Brennan also met with major military figures to discuss training, equipment assistance and the sharing of information, it said.  On Saturday, a pair of U.S. drone strikes killed 11 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen's Mareb province.  The strikes occurred nearly a week after a senior operative of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was killed by a CIA drone strike and less than three weeks after a Yemeni-linked terror plot to bring down a U.S.-bound jetliner was foiled.  Fahd al Quso, 37, was killed while riding in a vehicle in the Rafdh district in Shabwa province a week ago Sunday, according to officials.  Al Quso was indicted by a federal grand jury in New York in 2003 on 50 counts of terrorism offenses for his role in the October 12, 2000, bombing of the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen. The bombing killed 17 U.S. sailors.  The terror plot revealed last week has been described by U.S. officials as involving a device that is an evolution of the bomb smuggled aboard a U.S.-bound plane on Christmas Day 2009 by a young Nigerian, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab.  The device originated in Yemen and was brought to authorities' attention by a mole who infiltrated al Qaeda, a source in the region told CNN. The man works for Saudi intelligence, which has cooperated with the CIA for years, the source said. Information from the mole also led to the drone strike against al Quso.

Caroline Wozniacki has had her critics in the past. A defensive game and not landing a grand slam title while she was ranked No. 1 provided fodder for her detractors.  But now everyone, it seems, is rooting for the Dane.  Why? Well, much of it must be down to the fact that Wozniacki was dumpedand very publiclyby golf sensation Rory McIlroy only months before they were due to tie the knot.  McIlroy ended the relationship in May, saying he wasn't ready for marriage, and the news left Wozniacki devastated.  She was visibly distraught as she spoke to reporters at the French Open soon after, and exited in the first round, her earliest loss at Roland Garros in seven years.  The Northern Irishman has since rediscovered his vintage form, claiming he is more focused, and has won two major titles and regained his No. 1 ranking.  Wozniacki has also picked up her game after a lengthy slump.  She's the favorite to reach the U.S. Open final from the bottom half of the draw after upsetting Maria Sharapova on Sunday. And whereas Wozniacki said earlier in 2014 she would like to become a young mothersuggesting her tennis days were numberedher own focus is now solely on the court.  That Wozniacki is prospering in New York is slightly ironicit was where she was reportedly supposed to marry McIlroy in November. She's sure to return to the Big Apple that month, however, having decided following their split to run in the New York City Marathon.  Wozniacki has so far refused to discuss her relationship with McIlroy at the U.S. Open, not that any of the fans minded.  The crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium in her match against Sharapova was firmly behind the 24-year-old, leading her to gush afterwards: "The crowd was amazing today."  Her victory over Sharapova put Wozniacki into a first grand slam quarterfinal since the 2012 Australian Open.  "The season for me has been a little bit up and down," Wozniacki said. "And it's so nice to kind of start feeling like I'm playing the way I want to.  "This hard-court season has been amazing for me. I actually started already feeling really good on court since Eastbourne (in June). I have just been building on my game since then."  Wozniacki won a title in Istanbul in July and even though she didn't add to her haul in Montreal and Cincinnati, the player that stopped her was world No. 1 Serena Williams. Both of their encounters went to three sets.  They have become good friends this year, spending time together in Miami after their early departures from the French Open.  Although Wozniacki still can't be considered an attacking player, her serve has improved, and she has become more aggressive on the baseline.  Her retrieving, though, is still what gives opponents problems. Making Sharapova keep running paid off, as the Russian committed 43 unforced errors.  "I think she's better at what she's done really well in her career," Sharapova said. "I think she's moving extremely well; she's fit.  "I mean, she's always been fit, but there is a little bit more on her defense shots.  "It's not just balls up in the air. She's doing a little bit more with them."  Wozniacki faces another counter puncher, Sara Errani, in the last eight on Tuesday, and could face Williamsagainin the final. Williams advanced to the quarterfinals Monday by beating Estonia's Kaia Kanepi 6-3 6-3.  "I have had a great summer, and I told Serena I'm pretty tired of her," said Wozniacki. "I said, 'Can you just get out of my way?'  "We just laugh about it. This one was a great win for me. Maria, again, is a good player. For me, I think mentally as well to get that in my pocket is kind of nice.  "I still have hopefully a few good matches in me here in this tournament."  Pennetta continues U.S. success  New York is also proving to be a happy hunting ground for Flavia Pennetta, a semifinalist last year.  The Italian won the biggest title of her career in Indian Wells, California in March but has done little to back that up since.  However, the 11th seed is now one win away from matching that feat after topping Australia's Casey Dellacqua 7-5 6-2 in early play Monday to earn a place in the last eight.  But to get any further the 32-year-old will have to get past defending champion Williams.  The winner of that match will face either former world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka or Russia's Ekaterina Makarova.  Azarenka, a beaten finalist in New York the past two years but seeded 16th after a year of injury problems, came from behind to beat Serbia's Aleksandra Krunic 4-6 6-4 6-4.  Makarova, the 17th seed, reached the last eight for the second year in a row after upsetting Canada's rising star Eugenie Bouchard, winning 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 against the seventh seed.  Meanwhile, men's No. 1 Novak Djokovic beat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-1 7-5 6-4 and will face Andy Murray in the quarterfinals.  Eighth seed Murray, who beat Djokovic in the 2012 final to win his first grand slam title, brushed off France's world No. 10 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-5 7-5 6-4.  Japanese 10th seed Kei Nishikori reached the second grand slam quarterfinal of his career after outlasting Canada's No. 5 Milos Raonic in a marathon match that ended at 2:26 a.m. local timeequaling the latest finish in the tournament's history.  Nishikori triumphed 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (6-8) 7-5 6-4 in four hours 19 minutes to earn a clash with third-ranked Stanislas Wawrinka.  The Australian Open champion, a semifinalist here last year, defeated Spanish 16th seed Tommy Robredo 7-5 4-6 7-6 (9-7) 6-2.  
 Washington A 24-year-old Baltimore man was arrested at a major airport last week after 13 knives were discovered in his carry-on bag, authorities said Thursday.  The man, who said he collected knives, was charged with three counts relating to possessing knives in an airport, authorities said. He was not charged with any terror-related counts.  The incident occurred about 5:45 p.m. last Thursday at Baltimore-Washington International Airport near Baltimore.  Police identified the traveler as Amr Gamal Shedid, 24. Shedid was charged with one count of possession of a dangerous concealed weapon, one count of carrying an unauthorized weapon into an airport and one count of interfering with security procedures of the airport, said Sgt. Kirk Perez of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police.  Perez said the third count is a standard charge in incidents of this nature.  As of Thursday, Shedid was being held at the Anne Arundel County Detention Center in Annapolis, Maryland, on $10,000 bail, which was increased at a bail hearing this week from $2,600. Jail personnel did not have the name of Shedid's attorney.

Oxford, Mississippi From a dust mask that tested positive for ricin, to an enigmatic dump of a coffee grinder, to talk of making and mailing "poison," an affidavit unsealed Tuesday shed light on the case against a Mississippi man accused of sending potentially deadly letters to President Barack Obama and others.  Just more than a week ago, James Everett Dutschke described the man then jailed in the casean Elvis, Buddy Holly and Randy Travis impersonator named Paul Kevin Curtisas a "little nutty."  Now Curtis is free, and the 41-year-old Dutschke is behind bars. The document unsealed Tuesday explains what led authorities to arrest Dutschkebut not why he allegedly concocted the poison and sent it to elected officials.  Read the affidavit  Lawyers for Dutschke did not respond immediately to CNN's calls Tuesday for comment on the new details.  But the affidavit in support of a criminal complaint indicated that his name was brought up as a possible suspect by none other than Curtis, following the latter's April 17 arrest.  Curtis had been detained on allegations that he was responsible for mailing letters with suspicious substances to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County, Mississippi.  Soon, though, authorities began to set their focus on Dutschke as well.  That includes one person's claim, made on April 19 to law enforcement agents, that Dutschke years ago said he could make a "poison," the affidavit said.  What is ricin?  "Dutschke stated that he could place the poison in envelopes and send them to elected officials," said the witness, who had accused Dutschke of making sexual advances against his or her daughter. "... According to the witness ... Dutschke made reference to having 'a secret knowledge' for 'getting rid of people in office.'"  Document claims Dutschke repeatedly lied  On April 22, federal authorities searched a trash receptacle from Dutschke's Tupelo home and found, among other items, different types of yellow paper, address labels and a dust mask. The letters to Obama, Wicker and Holland were all on yellow paper.  That same day, FBI agents spotted Dutschke leaving his former tae kwon do facility, or dojo, loading things into his car, then placing several items from his window into a public trash can. According to the affidavit, these items included a coffee grinder, a box with latex gloves, a dust mask and an empty bucket of floor adhesive.  Three subsequent tests of the mask by the National Bioforensic Analysis Center came back positive for ricin, the document states.  Authorities further searched Dutschke's former tae kwon do dojo and tested six other samples, including liquid removed from a drain and swabs taken from inside the building.  At the time, Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that he had agreed to the FBI search "to help clear my name."  "I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters," he said.  Yet the affidavit states that laboratory tests showed five of the six samples taken from his dojo tested positive for ricin.  The document alleges that Dutschke lied to authorities on other fronts as well.  For example, he insisted that he hadn't been back to his tae kwon do dojo since April 15, before changing his story to say that he'd returned briefly one week later for a mop bucket, two pails and a fire extinguisher. He also claimed he had not stopped while leaving that building on his way to a pawn shop and seemed to be flummoxed when authorities told him they'd spotted him tossing items into a trash can.  The affidavit also alludes to Dutschke's or his family's possible frame of mind earlier this month, as seen in text messages on his wife's cell phone.  "We're coming over to burn some things," one such message from April 20 reads. Another from the same day states, "We are gonna clean house."  Twisted relationships and more  The lettersall postmarked April 8each had a suspicious substance inside, a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address.  They also contained a letter that read, in part: "To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."  On April 17, authorities arrested Curtis. He emphatically denied sending the letters, insisting he'd been framed and pointing the finger at Dutschke.  The two men knew each other because Dutschke used to work for Curtis' brother at an insurance company, under the direction of Curtis' ex-wife.  Curtis has said that while Dutschke worked for his brother, the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book but later had a falling out.  He has accused Dutschke of stalking him online, a claim the latter has denied.  As for Dutschke, he told reporters last week that he didn't have a relationship with Curtis.  "He's just a little nutty," he said.  Yet while the last line of the letters to Obama, Wicker and Holland all contain Curtis's signature online catchphrase"I am KC and I approve this message"the newly unsealed affidavit ties them to Dutschke.  Among them, it states that marks on the paper for all those letters match those of paper found in Dutschke's home and trash.  Businessman, musician and convicted criminal  So who is James Everett Dutschke?  He's held several jobs, including at the insurance company and owner of his tae kwon do dojo. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal described him as a musician.  He was also an aspiring politician. He ran as a Republican against Democratic state Rep. Steve Holland, the son of Judge Sadie Holland, and lost. Judge Holland dismissed a civil lawsuit that Dutschke had filed against the witness who told investigators that Dutschke had talked about "poison."  Dutschke is also no stranger to law enforcement.  Last year, residents in his Tupelo neighborhood sought police help after, one neighbor says, Dutschke repeatedly exposed himself to young girls.  The case resulted in a conviction on indecent exposure charges and a 90-day jail sentence. He's appealed the conviction, according to the Daily Journal newspaper.  Then came another arrest on January 18, that is tied to the ricin case in two ways.  In that case, according to a grand jury indictment handed up this month and obtained by CNN, Dutschke is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16.  This arrest prompted him to close his tae kwon do dojo. After the arrest, he consented to the seizure of his laptop computer, a hard drive and several flash drives, the affidavit in the ricin case states.  Investigators searched these and found that on New Year's Eve 2012 someone had downloaded a publication, "Standard Operating Procedure for Ricin," about safely handling the toxin. They also found that another file, about a method for detecting ricin, had been downloaded about two hours later. But according to the affidavit, Dutschke insisted that he'd never researched anything about ricin and that he'd never even seen a castor bean.  Whether it was Dutschke or someone else, and whatever their motivation, the ricin-tainted letters could have done more than make headlines or scare people.  They could have killed.  If inhaled, injected or ingested, less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours due to the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems. There is no known antidote.  In a seeming acknowledgment of these dangers, the FBI issued a statement Tuesday stating it had "immediately sealed off" Dutschke's former tae kwon do facilitywhich is near an auto body shop and an ice cream parlorand contacted public health authorities in the interest of public safety.  "The FBI is now conducting further forensic examination for the purpose of identifying trace evidence, residues and signatures of production that could provide evidence to support the investigation," the agency said.  CNN's Vivian Kuo reported from Mississippi, and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.  
 Tripoli, Libya A car bomb detonated in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on Saturday, causing material damage but no casualties, local officials said.  The Benghazi Local Council said in a statement that the rigged car detonated in al-Majuri district outside a school used as a training center for local municipal elections.  The blast damaged vehicles and nearby buildings, according to the council.  The Benghazi Local Council said it holds the government and the Interior Ministry responsible for what it described as the "dire situation" that has "plagued" the city for a while with the lack of security highlighted by killings and bombings.  In recent weeks there has been an uptick in violence in the city, most notably in an assassination campaign that has primarily targeted members of the security forces, most of whom held positions under the former regime  Over the past week at least four senior members of the security forces, including the head of the country's military police, have been assassinated in Benghazi.  In a report released by Human Rights Watch in August, the watchdog reported the death of more than 50 people in what it said was a "broadening wave of political assassinations" focused mostly in the eastern cities of Derna and Benghazi.  But in its report, Human Rights Watch said the number of those killed "is probably higher."  No group has claimed responsibility for these attacks, and there has been public outrage in the city over what activists and residents say is a lack of accountability.  So far no one has been brought to justice in the escalating violence in Benghazi.  This week Libyans marked the second anniversary of the fall of the Moammar Gadhafi regime, but many Libyans are concerned about the deteriorating security and the increasing power of the hundreds of militias with different regional and political loyalties that continue to operate freely in the country.  Following last year's attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, and a series of attacks targeting foreign diplomatic missions, there has been concern about the growing presence and activity of Islamist militant groups, some with ties to al Qaeda, mostly in the eastern part of the country.  The weakness of Libya's central government and its inability to build an army and police force was underscored this month with the kidnapping of the country's prime minister by a militia force that seized him for a few hours before releasing him.  Amid the growing concerns about the situation in the north African nation, NATO on Monday said it had agreed to Libya's request for the alliance to provide advice on defense institution building.  NATO said it will create a "a small advisory team to conduct this effort."  Many Libyans welcomed the move, but said this was something Western powers should have done two years ago following their military campaign that led to the overthrow of the regime.

They were young men in their early 20s, all of them joining the armed forces with a desire from an early age to serve their country. They were taken in the battlefield this week, not by enemy combatants but by their comrades in a tragic case of 'friendly fire.'  The U.S. military has not officially released the name of the five American service members who were killed Monday in southern Afghanistan when a coalition jet, called in to help ward off a Taliban attack, mistakenly bombed them.  According to NATO, the troops were conducting a security operation. Such operations have been stepped up ahead of Afghanistan's presidential runoff election, which will take place Saturday.  The service members' unit came under rocket fire from Taliban militants. They called in air support. "But the airstrike mistakenly bombed their own friends too," said Ghulam Sakhi Roghliwanai, the police chief of Zubair province where the incident took place.  Their families spoke to CNN affiliates and local newspapers, painting a picture of determined soldiers whose love for their country was rivaled equally by their love for their family.  Their deaths bring to 2,328 the number of Americans who have died since the Afghan war began in October 2001.  Here is a snapshot of four of the five service members. CNN is waiting to confirm the identity of the fifth:  Justin Clouse, 22  Clouse joined the Army a year after graduating high school in Sprague, Washington. He was on his second tour in Afghanistan as a gunner.  "He always wanted to service his country," his mother, TIna, told the Spokesman Review newspaper.  He had planned to leave the Army next May, marry his fiancee, study engineering and find a job in the oil industry, his mother told the paper.  Justin Helton, 24  Like Clouse, Helton too was engaged to be married. His family told CNN affiliate WBNS that his fiancee moved from Columbus, Ohio, to Fort Bragg in North Carolina to be closer to him. His friends were all looking forward to his return.  "I've never had a feeling like this," friend Tim Hattle told the TV station. "It just pulled the life right out of me."  Hattle said he'll most miss Helton's easygoing personality.  "He was just an all-around great guy," said Hattle. "Never seen him angry or get upset. Always lifts up people around him."  Aaron Toppen, 19  Toppen, of Mokena, Illinois, was a private who had been deployed to Afghanistan in March.  "I've known the Toppens for years. They're good people, and Aaron was a good boy, and he was excited about going into the military," neighbor Larry Bettenhausen told CNN affiliate WGN.  In a Facebook post, his sister, Amanda, called him "my biggest hero and the bravest man I know."  Scott Studenmund, 24  Studenmund knew he wanted to serve his country from a very young age, his family told CNN affiliate KTLA.  He had been a Green Beret and an Army staff sergeant, they said.  "He worked his way up the ladder in rank," neighbor Marlin James told the station. "They were so proud of him. We were all very proud of him."  CNN's Masoud Popalzai in Kabul contributed to this report.  
 San Angelo, Texas Attorneys are scheduled to be in court Wednesday to argue a motion to suppress evidence, a day after jury selection in the sexual assault trial of polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs.  It's unclear when the jury of 10 women and two men will hear opening statements.  The jury selection Tuesday followed a full day of questioning. At one point, nearly half of 207 potential jurors raised their hands when asked by defense attorney Deric Walpole "if you do not presume my client to be innocent."  Jeffs is charged with two counts of sexual assault on a child and one count of bigamy stemming from a 2008 raid on a ranch operated by his church.  Authorities raided the Yearning for Zion ranch near Eldorado, Texas, and removed 400 children who they feared had been sexually abused.  Some of the men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse and most of the children were later returned to their families.  The ranch is operated by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, an offshoot sect of the mainstream Mormon Church.  Walpole said he needs more time to present a defense, but Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said the defense has had sufficient time to prepare.  District Judge Barbara Walther told the pool of potential jurors Monday that the trial could last two to three weeks.  He is expected to be tried on the bigamy charge later.  The FLDS splintered from the Mormon Church more than a century ago when Mormons renounced the practice of polygamy. Jeffs' church is believed to have about 10,000 followers.  In Session's Jim Kyle, Lena Jakobsson and Beth Karas contributed to this report.

Gail Devers is a three-time Olympic gold medalist in track and field. But when she was in college, a diagnosis of Graves' disease, an immune system disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones, posed one of her biggest hurdles.  CNN: You were diagnosed with Graves' disease in 1990. What happened leading up to your diagnosis?  Gail Devers: I was in college at UCLA. Things were going very well; I had set an American record. Then, all of sudden, within a month, in my recollection, things started to fall apart.  My hair started falling out, and at that time, I had long hair. It was curly and doing its thing, and it started falling out. I had always had long nails unless I cut them; they started breaking. I couldn't figure out what was going on.  The weirdest part for me was losing weight. My normal running weight at that time was between 119 and 120 (pounds).  ... At my worstand I say at my worst because I stopped getting on the scale because I just couldn't stand the way I lookedat my worst, I was under like 85 pounds. Then it was like, "There is definitely something wrong."  I had made the 1988 Olympic team, and then the bottom fell out, is what I say. I couldn't run anywhere close to where I had ran just two months prior to that, so definitely there is a problem. When I got to the race in the 100-meter hurdles, I ran slower than the first time I ever ran when I ever stepped on the track.  ... There were no answers for almost 2 years, and it wasn't until 1990 (that I was diagnosed). I had even stopped going out of the house because I couldn't stand the way I looked. My face was breaking out; it had white or light spots all over. I had little to no hair, and nobody could tell me what was wrong.  I love kids and remember being at an event outside a little park, and a little kid walked by with their mom and said, "Mommy, what's wrong with her?"  That was the last time. I stopped going outside. I actually had covered up mirrors in my house because I didn't want to see myself. It wasn't a good time.  CNN: What inspired you to make it through being sick and return to running?  Devers: Although I got sidelined for three years, I figured ... I am going to figure this out go back out there. I still have that love and support from my coach and my family.  ... (In) 1992, at the Olympic Games ... back then the heat of the race was lane 4, 5 and 6, so that lets you know what (was) thought about me in lane 2. I tell people, probably three people in the world thought I could do it. It's not what other people believe you can do; it's what you believe you can do. I honestly believe that everything that happened to me happened for a reason.  My feet were saved. I was supposed to go out and win. This was my way. I remember getting out. I felt I had a great start. I don't remember the middle. I remember getting to the end. ...  In my race, there's 10 hurdles, but in life, there is always a hurdle. There is always something you gotta get over, and it's what you do, you know.  Sometimes we fall, sometimes we stumble, but we can't stay down. We can't allow life to beat us down. Everything happens for a reason, and it builds character in us, and it tells us what we are about and how strong we really are when we didn't think we could be that strong.  You have to get up. You have to keep going. You have to try harder, and if somebody else falls down, you have to pick them up and carry them with you. ... Life (is about) service and what can I do to help that next person who is struggling? What is it that happened to me in my life that I can share with somebody else, just to help them make it through?  I am very thankful that I have lived the life I have lived. I am thankful for my Graves' disease, and I tell people, if I had my whole life to live over, I would have it, because it has really made me into the person that I am.  I feel like I am stronger. There is nothing I don't feel like I can do if I try. ... I take medication every day for the rest of my life, and I just feel like it's a small price to pay to have my life.  
 After hours of back and forth between members, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America decided Friday evening to accept noncelibate clergy members and lay leaders who are in "lifelong" and "monogamous" same-sex relationships.  Previous Evangelical Lutheran Church policy allows gay and lesbian clergy, lay people to serve only if celibate.  One of the country's largest Protestant denominations, the Lutheran church approved four recommendations to its ministry's policies that underscore a new approach to homosexuality.  While the recommendations passed at the weeklong Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis, Minnesota, do not address recognizing same-sex marriage or civil unions, they do allow congregations to support same-sex relationships among their members and allow individuals in same-sex relationships to hold clergy positions.  The previous policy of the 4.6-million member church allowed gay people to serve as members of professional rosters only if they were celibate.  Some members argued prior to the vote that the change would fly in the face of religious teachings.  "Brothers and sisters, I ask you, before you dig yourselves deeper into this hole, if you are so absolutely certain that these behaviors are not sinful that you are willing to place yourselves and this church at the spiritual risk that comes from encouraging sin," said the Rev. Steven Frock of the Western Iowa Synod.  Among those on the other side was Alan Wold of the Northern Illinois Synod. "If according to some I am going to be in err for supporting this... Let me err on the side of mercy, grace, justice, and love of neighbor. Let me err on the side of gospel, which makes all things new."  Many feared the emotional debate could tear at the unity of the church. So the members voted to re-order their resolutionsmoving to the top a resolution that the church "commit itself to bear one another's burdens, love thy neighbor, and respect the bound consciences of all." It passed with overwhelming support.  Other religious denominations, including Episcopalians and Unitarians, have made moves to accept gay clergy, and Evangelical Lutherans would not be the first to accept those openly in same-sex relationships, said David Masci, a senior researcher at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. But ELCA would be the largest to make such a move.  The church is the third largest Protestant denomination, representing 2 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Pew Forum.  The battle Friday was the latest in what Masci said many "socially moderate" denominations, including those in Judaism, are grappling with: balancing the growing acceptance of same-sex relationships with traditional teachings.  As some have moved toward accepting same-sex relationships, within those same denominations "you see more conservative wings that are pushing back against it," said Masci.  On hand for Friday's debate were hundreds of "interested parties"including some people who are not members of the church, said John Brooks, ELCA spokesman.  When asked whether there had been protests or rallies on either side outside the convention site, he responded, "Interestingly, no."  In the convention hall, Brooks said, "The debates haven't been rancorous or mean-spirited in any way. They've been quite civil. But people have been passionate with their feelings."  The Rev. Terri Stagner-Collier of the Southeastern Synod said a vote in favor of the resolutions would cause members of her own family to leave the church. Her sister "felt her church was being ripped away from her," Stagner-Collier said tearfully, adding, I urge you not to do this to all of those people in the pew and in my family."  Sara Gross of the Oregon Synod said some "dear members" of the church will be lost if the resolution passes. But, she said, "A vote to reject this recommendation sends a message to the world saying 'not all are welcome.'"  In a "changing world," Gross argued, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America "needs to be a voice that stands up and says 'yes.'"  CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.

New York An apparent dispute over housing ended with an 86-year-old New York man shooting his grandson and killing his grandson's girlfriend before fatally shooting himself, a law enforcement source said Saturday.  Police were still trying to sort out what led Heriberto Pagan to drive from his home in Brooklyn to his daughter's Staten Island house Friday and shoot two people before taking his own life.  A law enforcement source said investigators were looking into the possibility that the grandson "was trying to take over" the home with his girlfriend and Pagan "wasn't appreciative of the way" his daughter was being treated in the process. It was not clear whether the daughter was at home at the time.  Police found Pagan, a gunshot wound to the head, outside his car Friday evening near the home where the shootings occurred. He was hospitalized in critical condition, but died Saturday morning, police said.  In the vicinity, police were alerted to another shooting victim, Pagan's 47-year-old grandson, who was critically injured with a gunshot wound to the head and found outside the Staten Island house where he lived with his mother and girlfriend. The grandson has not been identified.  Inside the house, police found a second victim, Claritle Christina Huerta, 28, also shot in the head. She was pronounced dead at a local hospital.  "This is like a nightmare," neighbor John Rina told CNN affiliate WCBS.  Police said Pagan shot his grandson as the younger man approached the house. He then shot Huerta inside before driving a few blocks and shooting himself, authorities said.  "I just heard a man screaming 'help me, help me,'" a neighbor, not identified, told WCBS.  A 4-month-old boy was found unharmed in the home and placed in the care of child welfare authorities, police said.  "There [were] a lot of problems in that house, I could say, but it never really exploded the way it [did] today," an unidentified neighbor told CNN affiliate NY1 News. "This is actually probably a buildup to everything that's been happening for ... years."  Teen cop killers likely turned gun on selves  
 Washington When Tip O'Neill retired in 1987, he was asked how the quality of people elected to Congress had changed in his 30-plus years of service. The former Speaker of the House answered: "The quality is clearly better, much better." But, he added, "The results are definitely worse."  He meant: as compared to the Congresses of the 1950s, the Congresses of the 1980s contained fewer drunks and fewer crooks. Members were better educated and harder working. Yet the Congresses of the 1950s managed to balance the budget, confirm presidential nominees in reasonable time and enact programs, like the one that created the interstate highway system. The Congresses of the 1980s could do none of those things.  And of course the contemporary record is even worse. This past summer, Congress very nearly pushed the United States into an unnecessary default. Another government shutdown looms. The budgeting of the United States is in chaos. The Federal Reserve has been left for months with two vacancies on its seven-member board because of secret holds by individual senators.  Politics is a contest, limited by certain unwritten rules. And over the past two decades, old rules have broken down.  Under the old rules, there were certain things that political parties did not doeven though theoretically they could. If one party controlled the Senate and another party controlled the presidency, the Senate party did not reject all the president's nominees. The party that controlled the House did not refuse to schedule votes on the president's budgets. Individual senators did not use secret holds to sway national policy. The filibuster was reserved for rare circumstancesnot as a routine 60-vote requirement on every Senate vote.  It's incredible to look back now on how the Reagan tax cut passed the Democratic House in 1981. The Democratic House leaderships could have refused to schedule votes on Reagan's tax plans. Instead, they not only allowed the tax plan to proceedbut they allowed 48 of 243 Democrats to break ranks on the key procedural vote without negative consequences to their careers in the Democratic party. (Rep. Dan Glickman of Kansas, for example, who voted for the tax cuts would rise to become Secretary of Agriculture under President Clinton.)  Hard to imagine Speaker John Boehner allowing his Republicans to get away with similar behavior on a measure proposed by President Obama.  What's happening before our eyes is that the US congressional system is adopting the attitudes of a Westminster-style parliamentary system.  In a parliamentary system, "the duty of an opposition is to oppose" (in the famous words of Benjamin Disraeli). The opposition uses every trick and technique to thwart and defeat the government; the government uses all the powers of a parliamentary majority to overwhelm the opposition. (To quote Disraeli again: "a majority is always better than the best repartee.")  Then, at regular intervals, the two sides switch roles.  In the American system, there is no "government" and no "opposition." Who would lead such a "government"? President Obama? Or the man in command of the majority in the lower HousePrime Minister John Boehner?  In a system built around an administration and a bicameral Congress, everybody is part of the governmentand the government only functions if there exists a certain baseline spirit of cooperation between the mutually indispensable parts.  That spirit of cooperation has tended to vanish in recent years. Back in 1986, Democratic leaders quashed those in their party who wished to try impeach Ronald Reagan over Iran-Contra. But as the Cold War ended, the party struggle intensified. The shock of the economic crisis since 2008 has made things worse still: desperate times lead to desperate politics.  The old rules were based upon certain conditions that have long since vanished.  Back then, Congress was filled with legislators who shared the common bond of military service: in 1981, 73 of the senators were veterans as compared to only 25 today; a similar trend characterizes the House.  The imperatives of the Cold War inspired a spirit of deference to the president.  The long association of the filibuster with opposition to civil rights tended to discredit its use.  The national media were dominated by a few big institutions that professed (even if they did not always deliver) nonpartisanship.  Americans intermingled more with people of different points of view. Bill Bishop points out in his important book, "The Big Sort," in the very close presidential election of 1976, only 26% of Americans lived in a county that went for Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter by a margin of 20 points or more. In the also close presidential election of 2004, almost 50% of Americans lived in a county that voted by more than 20 points for either George W. Bush or John Kerry.  Perhaps above all: the long prosperity of the postwar years lubricated the system with enough resources that just about everybody could get some of what they wanted: more spending, moderate taxes, reasonable borrowing, strong national defense.  Now instead we have a country that is spatially polarized, that gets its information from highly partisan media, and that confronts the worst recession and the darkest financial outlook since the 1930s.  The results of these changes are breaking the American political systemdestroying public confidence in the U.S. governmentand paralyzing the U.S. economic policy. It will take more than a change in attitudes to address these concerns. It will take fundamental institutional reform.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.

What is it about Americans and guns?  How much time do you have?  "I can tell you that I don't think there's any other developed country in the world that has remotely the problem we have," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said after the shooting rampage in Colorado.  There are an estimated 270 million guns in the hands of civilians in the United States, making Americans the most heavily armed people in the world per capita. Yemen, a tribal nation with no history of strong central government or the rule of law, comes in a distant second.  From Washington to the well-stocked shelves of Walmart stores nationwide, guns are regarded in the United States as a commonplace if controversial consumer item for millions of law-abiding hunters, collectors and citizens concerned about their safety. They are also in the hands of thousands of killers too; a Washington-based anti-gun lobby says those guns shoot more than 100,000 people a year. In 2010, there were more than 30,000 deaths caused by firearms when the number of homicides, suicides and accidental deaths are tallied.  America's collective memoryof the Wild West in the 1800s, the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King half a century ago and the front-page news from last weekis marked time and time again by guns.  "It's undeniable," writes Clayton Cramer, author of "Armed America: the Remarkable Story of How and Why Guns Became as American as Apple Pie." "Guns are at the center of much of America's history, its legends, and its horrors."  There were guns in America long before the America we know today was even born. Early settlers in several states were required by law to own and maintain weapons as a matter of collective defense.  By the time the United States was established, its citizens had taken up arms not only against their Native American neighbors but the army of their own king. Their new constitution reflected that in its Bill of Rights, declaring that "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."  For more than two centuries, that remained an important but largely overlooked guarantee, subjected to a modest series of controls. But in 2008 and 2010, landmark Supreme Court rulings gave that constitutional right sweeping new power, dramatically diminishing the authority of state and local governments to limit gun ownership.  Gun-friendly lawmakers have been active, too. Roughly half of the 50 U.S. states have adopted laws allowing gun owners to carry their guns openly in most public places. About as many states have "stand your ground" laws that allow people to kill if they come under threat, even, in some cases, if they can escape the threat without violence.  The laws are being driven by politics, and the politics are being driven by groups such as the National Rifle Association. Once a relatively modest organization of gun enthusiasts and hunters, it has become one of the most powerful political groups in the country. The Washington Post estimates that the NRA succeeded in helping elect four out of every five candidates it endorsed in the most recent congressional election.  In addition to that extraordinary impact in Congress, it has been working to overturn gun-control laws in the courts.  The NRA and other gun-rights groups have allied themselves with the Republican Party and, especially, a sector of the American public suspicious of government intrusions into private life and often flatly hostile to Washington.  Read Dana Bash: For Democrats, gun politics are bad politics  "When they tell you that a government ban on certain firearms will somehow make you safer, don't you believe it, not for a second, because it's a lie just like the lies they've told you before," NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre told a recent gathering of his members. "Their laws don't work."  Poll results suggest most Americans wouldn't agree. CNN and Gallup surveys going back years suggest that Americans are split between those who approve of current gun-control laws and respondents who would like to see them made more restrictive. Americans who'd like no controls at all are a small minority.  But even after the rampage in Colorado, American attitudes and laws aren't likely to change much. Last year's nearly fatal shooting of congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords didn't move her state or federal colleagues to adopt any new gun control measures.  Both President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney issued statements in the hours after the Colorado shootings, and Sunday, Obama flew to the state to visit with shooting victims and their families. But neither proposed any changes to American attitudes toward guns.  "You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country," said New York's Bloomberg, who is both a declared "independent" politically and a vocal proponent of gun control.  America is not unique. Norwegians are marking the first anniversary of a shooting massacre that took the lives of 69 people at a summer camp outside of Oslo. Eight more people were that day killed by a bomb in the Norwegian capital itself. The confessed killer is awaiting the verdict of his trial.  But America seems to be the place the whole world thinks of when apparently ordinary people use guns for grotesque acts of violence. America stands alone in its historic and cultural attachment to guns. America stands armed.  Do you own a gun? Tell us why.

 Punctuating the scenes of heroic rescue and devastating death in Haiti is another drama: moments of connection.  A man in Haiti identifies a woman he sees on the street as the missing person whose photo is posted on CNN's iReport. A husband reels off the names of missing college students and a stranger hundreds of miles away confirms they are safe.  It is a scenario being played out again and again. Somehow, desperate pleas relayed mouth-to-mouth, through the Internet, on television and in text messages become fodder for celebration with the confirmation: They're alive.  iReporter Wolin Delerme sent in a frantic video about her sister who had left for Haiti on Monday, a day before the 7.0-magnitude quake struck. Minutes after her plea aired on CNN, a man in Haiti contacted her.  "He saw my sister not too far from where he's standing," Delerme said.  Watch Delerme describe the amazing connection with her missing sister  Choking back tears, she said, "I am very overwhelmed, and full of joy in my heart. There's just no words that can explain it. I am just so happy." She has since spoken with her sister.  Kristy Springer sought information on her mother and several church members who were in Haiti on a missionary trip. "I am here waiting for you mom. You need to be OK," Springer told iReport.  Her mother sent a text message at 1:30 a.m. Thursday. Everyone was "at least safe for now."  See how Springer found her mom  iReporter Darius Hyworon found similar good news. His wife, Mariah Levin, was with a group of Tufts University students in Haiti at the time. In the quake's aftermath, he scrambled to learn their fate. The U.S. Embassy was able to tell him everyone is OK.  Read Hyworon's words of thanks  "Thank you for those who helped in the effort," he said. "Please pray for the millions of people who are affected by this tragedy."  iReport: Are you looking for loved ones?  Much of Haiti's infrastructure crumbled during the quake, knocking out power and other communication networks, further hampering people's efforts to get word of missing relatives and friends.  Mark Frohardt is heading to Haiti with two "radio suitcases," mobile communication devices with a range of about 30 miles that can tap into radio waves. A veteran of disaster efforts in the 2004 tsunami and the 2008 Pakistan quake, Frohardt hopes to disseminate critical information about humanitarian efforts over the radio in Haiti. As of Friday, 13 radio stations were up and running.  "Part of that is 'family tracing,' " he said, "working with organizations and radio stations on getting the word outwho's alive and getting messages back to loved ones."  iReport: I'm alivemessages from Haiti  There is no confirmed death toll from the earthquake. Bodies litter the streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and barely functioning clinics are overwhelmed with injured. Survivors wander the streets.  For loved ones seeking information on the missing, the wait is anguishing. Sometimes the answers that come are not reliable.  Len Gengel and his wife have endured a parent's worst nightmare. Their daughter Brittany was visiting Haiti with a group of students from Lynn University in Florida.  The parents were initially told their daughter survived. Upon reaching South Florida for what they thought was going to be a reunion, the parents learned the original information was wrong. Brittany was still missing, along with three other students and two professors.  On Monday, Gengel spoke to Kenneth Merten, the U.S. ambassador to Haiti, on CNN "We need American soldiers up there rescuing our children now," Gengel said. "Time is of the essence. I beg you." Merten said he would do all he could.  Read an iReporter's list of people reported to be safe  The International Committee of the Red Cross has set up a Web site for people trying to find information on the fate of relatives in Haiti. However, inside Haiti, the Red Cross has not been able to collect and publish identities and whereabouts of survivors.  Frohardt, a vice president for Internews Network, hopes to help change that.  "The focus," he says, is "connecting the community so they know where all their loved ones are."

Three years after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, workers have dug up a massive chunk of weathered crude from the shallows off a Louisiana beach.  The tar mata slab of oil residue mixed with wet sandwas about 165 feet long by 65 feet wide, said Lt. Cmdr. Natalie Murphy, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. It weighed more than 40,000 pounds, but more than 85% of that weight was sand, shells and water, she said.  The mat was found under the surf off Isle Grand Terre, Louisiana, about 90 miles south of New Orleans. Crews using an excavator dug the largely submerged tar mat out of the beach in chunks over the last few weeks, Murphy said.  Louisiana is the last state where regular cleanup operations from the oil spill are still under way. The Coast Guard and BP, the owner of the ruptured well at the heart of the disaster, declared the cleanup over in Alabama, Florida and Mississippi earlier this month, but more than 80 miles of the Louisiana coast are still being patrolled.  BP has recovered more than 2.7 million pounds of waste from Louisiana shores in 2013, with residual oil making up between 5 and 15% of that total weight, company spokesman Jason Ryan told CNN.  The drill rig Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank in April 2010, killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher a mile beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the oil is believed to have evaporated or been consumed by microbes deep under water. But a still-undetermined portion settled to the floor of the Gulf, and some of it was stirred up and washed back ashore after Hurricane Isaac in 2012.  
 One damp, chilly evening in October, Dolores Kopchak called the police. She had a rather unusual problem: a lion in her back yard.  She was calling from Kopchak Road, named after her family and familiar to law enforcement authorities in the small town of Zanesville, Ohio. They had had responded to complaints there before.  Kopchak's neighbor, Terry Thompson, owned a bunch of wild animals. When Sgt. Steve Blake arrived on the scene, he saw a black bear and two African lions.  He immediately shut down Kopchak Road and called for help. What happened next on that evening reads more like the stuff of an action-packed adventure novel than police reports.  The Muskingum County Sheriff's Office has released many of those reports that reveal how law enforcement officials were thrust into a desperate hunt for potential killers on the loose.  On October 18, as highway signs cautioned drivers to remain in cars and local schools were making a decision to close the next morning, deputies traversed Thompson's property and beyond and came face to face with animals that most people see from the other side of a cage or in the safety of a guided safari.  Deputy Jay Lawhorne had been on Thompson's property before, responding to previous complaints about him, including animal abuse.  Thompson, 62, had been released from a federal prison September 30 after pleading guilty earlier this year to possessing illegal firearms, including five fully automatic firearms. A civil case seeking forfeiture of firearms was pending.  Lawhorne picked up his M4 rife with .223-caliber ammo and got in the back of the pickup.  The deputies began going up Thompson's driveway not knowing what they would find. It was already after 6 p.m. and they knew they only had one hour of daylight left.  There were cages on the left and the right of the driveway. Tigers, lions, cheetahs and bears roamed about.  They were ordered to find Thompson and "neutralize" any animal that posed a threat to people. With no tranquilizers on hand, their only choice was to shoot.  Thompson's house was empty, save two monkeys and a small dog, Blake said in his report. On his way out, Blake saw a body near an embankment.  It was Thompson. He was on his back. A handgun lay near him. And a pair of blue bolt cutters. He had used it to free all his animals from their pens before he shot himself.  A large white tiger was sitting 5 feet away. It appeared the cat had fed on Thompson's flesh, Blake said.  It was impossible for the deputies to approach the body because of the tiger.  The deputies called for more help and got out on foot.  Right behind Thompson's large barn, at the top of hill near the house, they saw several large cages where the larger lions had been kept. The deputies secured the heavy wooden doors but as they got closer, they realized the cages had been cut open.  A lion came out just 3 feet away. Lawhorne said he was forced to shoot it dead. Another deputy encountered a lion hissing at him and baring its lethal teeth.  Behind the lions were pens that held bears and wolves but, instead, a tiger and bear came out. The tiger charged Lawhorne. It, too, had to be put down.  The deputies were able to save a black panther and a spotted leopard.  At 11:30, the deputies gave up the search for the night. Lawhorne said Sheriff Matt Lutz told him his replacement would arrive at 6:30 in the morning.  But Lawhorne was not out of danger yet.  He and Deputy Adam Swope were walking down to the back of Thompson's property when they encountered a tiger hiding in the brush.  They radioed it in and were informed that a Columbus zookeeper was on her way to tranquilize the cat.  It took 15 minutes for her to get there. It was going to take another 10 minutes for the tranquilizer to take effect.  Lawhorne and other deputies stood by with assault weapons. Just in case.  The tiger jolted when the dart hit, but it did not get up. But after a few minutes, it charged directly at the zookeeper. The deputies fired. The tiger backed off and laid down.  They gave it another 15 minutes for the tranquilizer to take effect. The zookeeper then felt it was safe to approach. But when they were less than 10 feet away, the tiger thrashed again.  This time, it was shot dead.  In all, deputies shot 49 of Thompson's menagerie. Some, like the Bengal tigers, were endangered species.  Thompson's wife, Marian, chose a burial site, according to the police reports. The animals were placed in a single grave.  John Moore, who worked as a caretaker for Thompson's animals, said that he had last seen Terry Thompson the day before he died, according to the police reports. Thompson told him then that he had received a letter about Marian cheating on him.  He told Moore: "I have a plan to find out and you will know when it happens."  No one may ever know what Thompson's plans includedhis death is still under investigation and not all records have been released.  Thompson is gone. So are his animals. The Humane Society of the United States said that under the circumstances, it did not fault the deputies for using deadly force.  But a public debate was sparked over exotic animals and the laws that govern ownership.  The bizarre events that day were seen around the world. And Zanesville will forever go down as the small Ohio city with the really big animals.

Laura Kassem had tripped before. But this time, she fell hard. She couldn't seem to control her body as she went down, even to protect her face from hitting the concrete sidewalk.  It happened again the next day as she stepped off an escalator. Then again in the parking garage on Monday when she went to work.  "I had no idea what was going on," the 33-year-old remembers. "I had no idea why I would just drop all of a sudden."  The third time, she went to the emergency room, where a neurologist ordered an MRI and a cardiologist performed a tilt testnormally done on patients who faint because of a sudden drop in blood pressure.  The tests revealed nothing. Doctors sent Kassem home with instructions to drink more water.  Kassem continued to trip over nothing. So she went to the Cleveland Clinic, where she says her symptoms "baffled" doctors in the rheumatology, cardiology and neurology departments.  Back home in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo, Kassem made an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon to address the extreme pain in her hips and lower back. He sent her to a neurosurgeon, who in turn sent her to see a neurologist who specialized in neuromuscular disorders.  Meanwhile, Kassem tried to avoid open spaces. She hugged walls so that if her body froze up, she wouldn't fall flat on her face. She already had a few loose teeth, and her nose was a mix of blue and purple.  One night, Kassem and her sister were watching "20/20" when the woman being interviewed began describing Kassem's symptoms. The woman had been diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome, or SPS, a rare neurological disorder characterized by painful muscle spasms and progressive stiffness in the lower back and limbs.  Could that be it? the Kassems asked themselves. They had never heard of SPS. But Kassem's latest neurologist thought they could be right. While waiting for the test results, he put Kassem on benzodiazepine, a medication that is known to lessen the symptoms of SPS.  It worked. For the first time in nearly a year, Kassem was able to walk without assistance.  Read more of Laura's story on iReport  The exact prevalence of Stiff Person Syndrome is unknown, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, but one estimate places it at one in every 1 million people. That means about 316 people in the United States have it.  The exact cause of SPS is also unknown. Doctors believe it has something to do with a deficiency of glutamic acid decarboxylase, or GAD. GAD is involved in the body's production of gamma-aminobutyric acid, which helps control muscle movement. In patients with SPS, antibodies mistakenly attack certain neurons that produce GAD, leaving the body without the protein it needs.  The symptoms of SPS generally start to appear in patients after age 30. People with SPS initially experience muscle stiffness or discomfort. As the disease progresses, muscle spasms and rigidity become more pronounced. These muscle spasms can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, and are triggered by unexpected noises, physical contact, stress and/or emotional anxiety.  "I've fallen on the streets and prayed to God that someone wouldn't run over me," says Ingrid Steppan, who was diagnosed with SPS five years ago. "My husband can't touch my arm. My kids can't give me hugs."  Steppan compares the muscle spasms to childbirth. Imagine contractions felt in the uterus happening from your neck down to your toes, she says. The whole body goes stiffhence the syndrome's name.  When she first began experiencing symptoms, Steppan couldn't dress herself. Her 9-year-old son had to help her put on her underwear, because his older siblings had all moved out and her husband went to work early.  "It was embarrassing for him and it was embarrassing for me," she remembers. "We both cried."  Treatment has helped. While there is no cure yet for SPS, patients are often put on benzodiazepines to treat muscle stiffness and calm the spasms. Anti-seizure medications and painkillers are sometimes prescribed as well to lessen symptoms.  Yet after years of freezing and falling unexpectedly because of stress or sudden sounds, many patients with SPS develop agoraphobia, an irrational fear of certain places and/or situations. They become housebound, unable to venture outside their comfort zone.  "My mind knows I'm OK, but my body won't cooperate," Steppan says. "If I try to go outside, my body completely stiffens up, and I will fall over flat. You can put a sticker on my head and put me up for sale. I'm a statue for your lawn."  A few years ago, Steppan underwent intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, or IVIg, a common treatment for patients with SPS.  With IVIg, a concentrated solution of sterilized antibodies is given to the patient through one of their veins. IVIg is most commonly used to help people with autoimmune disorders. Although SPS is a neurological disorder, it has "features" of an autoimmune disease, according to the National Institutes of Health.  Those features could eventually lead scientists to a cure.  Dr. Harry Atkins, medical director of regenerative medicine at Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Ontario, Canada, has been studying the effects of stem cell transplantation on autoimmune diseases for close to a decade.  Five years ago, a patient with SPS approached him with her medical history. She had done her research, Atkins says, and told him that a stem cell transplant could restore her immune systemridding it of the antibodies fighting against GAD production.  "She made a very compelling case that this was worth trying," Atkins remembers. "That's how I learned about Stiff Person Syndrome."  During a stem cell transplant, doctors use strong doses of chemotherapy to wipe out the patient's immune system. They then return purified bone marrow stem cells to the body.  "It appears that as the immune system regrows, it's like a baby's immune system," Atkins says. "It recognizes what's part of the body, and is able to fight against germs and pathogens."  It's a dangerous procedure. When their immune system is wiped out, patients are prone to infection and organ damage. As such, it is reserved for those with only the most severe autoimmune diseases.  Atkins decided SPS fit that bill and performed the stem cell transplant. His first SPS patient is now symptom-free, he says, and off all medications typically used for treating the rare disorder. He performed another transplant on a second SPS patient two years ago. That patient is symptom-free as well, he says, though she still relies on a few medications.  "I didn't believe the procedure would work so well," Atkins says. "It's like a miracle to see what she was like before, and to see her nowit's quite dramatic."  Steppan will be Atkins' third SPS patient.  Last week, doctors harvested her stem cells for sterilization. She hopes to receive her last dose of chemotherapy soon, so they can then start rebuilding her immune system.  Atkins is cautious about saying stem cell transplantation is the definitive treatment for Stiff Person Syndrome. The results have been encouraging, but the procedure has only been done in two patients. The rarity of the disease makes it difficult to find research fundingnot to mention participants. All three procedures were performed in Canada under the country's universal health care system.  Doctors at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle have an open clinical trial protocol for doing stem cell transplants on patients with Stiff Person Syndrome, says Dr. George Georges. Unfortunately, most insurance carriers in the United States will not cover the cost of the transplant.  Kassem is trying to raise $400,000 as a deposit.  The Ohio resident has been bedridden since October. She has spasms that cause her whole body to stretch out and shake. Her brother is the only one strong enough to bend her legs when they go stiff. She lives with her parents, and someone has to be home 24/7.  Kassem has made many new friends through rare disease support groups online. They're so few and far between it's often the only way patients with SPS can find each other. She and Steppan have communicated through Facebook.  "It's a very lonely life," Steppan says. "I talk to them every day and they talk to me. ... These people need to believe that there's hope."  See more stories from people living with Stiff Person Syndrome  
 Vicksburg, Mississippi When Mary Washington died in 2006 at the age of 54, she carried 260 pounds on her 4-foot-11-inch frame.  "Cancer killed her, but obesity restricted her life," said Washington's sister, Linda Fondren. "Her last words to me were, 'Linda, I wish I had lived my life more for myself.' "  Washington had been a single mother, working multiple jobs in the food service industry to make ends meet.  "She did not know that she could do both," Fondren said. "You can be of service to people ... but you must take care of yourself first."  It's not an uncommon story in Mississippi. Its nickname is the "Hospitality State," but for the last six years it has been the fattest state in the nation, according to a 2009 report by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 34.4 percent of Mississippi's adults are obese, meaning they have a body mass index of 30 or more.  Fondren, 54, wants to move her state from the fattest to the fittest. For the last four years, she has led her hometown of Vicksburg in its battle with the bulge.  Being the fattest state "is not a good heavyweight title to hold," she said. "I felt that people needed to be challenged."  Fondren remembered how her sister had been too embarrassed to exercise in a gym with men. So in June 2006, she opened an all-female workout facility, Shape Up Sisters.  The gym was a successit now has more than 600 membersbut Fondren eventually realized that she needed to expand her reach if she wanted to slim down her community.  She says part of the problem in Vicksburg is that being overweight is so commonplace it is often considered the norm.  "Most people ... they do not know that they have a weight problem because we live in an environment where everyone almost looks the same," she said.  So in October 2009, Fondren kicked off Shape Up Vicksburg. The initiative challenged residents to lose weight while giving them the tools they needed to reach their goal.  Fondren held free fitness and nutrition classes across the city and convinced many of the city's restaurants to add healthy items to their menus. Participants could track their weight loss online or at weigh-in stations at Wal-Mart and the local medical center.  "People want to do good, but they need help," Fondren said.  Approximately 2,500 people joined Fondren's movement, and over 17 weeks they shed, on average, more than 5 pounds each. To date, residents have lost nearly 15,000 pounds.  Many attribute the success to Fondren's relentless determination.  "She takes no prisoners. She's committed to weight loss," said Vicksburg Mayor Paul Winfield, who lost 16 pounds.  Today, Shape Up Vicksburg includes a walking club, which draws up to 200 people, and a weekly nutrition class. Fondren's gym is also open to all women every Saturday, and she frequently teaches fitness classes at area schools and churches.  All of these activities are free, something she believes is a critical factor.  "It's the poor African-American and white communities that are the most obese, and those are the ones that are most unreachable," Fondren said.  As a successful real estate developer, Fondren largely funds the effort herself, but the initiative also receives donations from local businesses.  Ebony Fisher, 22, believes the program saved her life. After her 32-year-old cousin died of kidney failure last year, Fisher, who weighed 320 pounds, was frightened.  "I felt as though if I didn't lose weight I was going to die," she said.  But fear drove her to take action. Since joining Shape Up Vicksburg six months ago, Fisher has lost 50 pounds.  It's those stories that keep Fondren motivated. She's determined to expand her effort statewide to find more converts to her cause.  "This is a life-or-death issue," she said. "Obesity affects us all ... and the only way that we're going to combat it is: Stand together."  Want to get involved?

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio bit into some unexpected publicity recently when he was photographed politely eating pizzawith a knife and fork.  At a Staten Island pizzeria, no less.  Now, the act that sent the Internet into a frenzy with chatter about what most New Yorkers scorn as a serious food flub portends to deliver some doughas in moneyto charity.  Goodfella's Pizzeria co-owner Marc Cosentino says he will auction off the infamous fork that de Blasio used in a charity fundraiser.  After the mayor and his entourage went their way following a Friday stop at Goodfella's, Cosentino decided it would be a good idea to hold on to the notorious fork.  A retired NYPD sergeant, Cosentino baked up the idea to store the fork in an evidence bag and put it on display at the bar.  "You can't imagine all the people that come in that want to look at the fork and take pictures of it," Cosentino told CNN on Wednesday.  Dubbed by some with tongues firmly in cheek as the new mayor's "pizzagate," the ensuing publicity has prompted multiple charities to reach out to Cosentino in hopes of getting a piece of the pie.  When asked how much he thinks the renowned utensil would sell for, Cosentino referred to a previous charity benefit in 2013 for New York's hungry when a dozen "cronuts"half-croissant and half-doughnut pastriesreportedly were auctioned for $14,000.  "I think we can beat that," Cosentino proudly said.  As for the mayor with manners, his office released a statement to CNN giving the idea of a charity auction an extra topping. "We hope they include the knife to raise even more funds," the statement said.  Will de Blasio be welcomed back in Goodfella's Pizzeria following what some consider a pizza faux pas?  "Absolutely! He was a total gentleman," Cosentino declared. "As long as people are eating pizza it's okay with me."  Snowstorm an early test for Bill de Blasio  
 Few issues divide people more sharply than abortion. So it is great news when recently lawmakers across the political aisle in Britain voted 181 to 1 to ban sex-selective abortion. The overwhelming support for banning abortion of a fetus based on its gender is progressive, moral and just.  But what about gendercidethe practice of killing baby girls, whether aborted or neglected after birth? Surely, there is no room for disagreement on the need to end gendercide.  For every woman who freely chooses to abort a girl, there are countless others who are being forced to do so because of strong cultural preference for son.  The sex-selective abortion of baby girls is not a pro-choice or a pro-life issue. It is a human rights issue that must be approached as an area of common ground. It is a woman's right to give birth to her daughter.  For most of us, hearing "it's a girl" during a pregnancy ultrasound is cause for celebration. But in many countries, this phrase can be a death sentence. In fact, the words, "it's a girl" are the deadliest words on earth when heard during pregnancy. According to a U.N. estimate, up to 200 million women are missing in the world today due to gendercide.  In China, the birth ratio of girls to boys is the most skewed in the worldapproximately 100 girls born for every 118 boys. When couples are restricted to one child, women often become the focus of intense pressure by their husband and in-laws to give birth to a boy.  A woman need not be dragged out of her home and strapped down to a table to be a victim of forced abortion. Crushing social, economic, political and personal pressures in cultures with a strong son preference trample women who are pregnant with a girl.  All too often, women in these cultures do not "choose" their daughters for abortion. They are forced. The "Terracotta Daughters" exhibit recently on view in New York City gave dramatic visual form to the girls that have been lost to the world through sex-selective abortionthe haunting stares of an army of the dead.  Because of gendercide, there are an estimated 37 million more men than women in China. As a result, the presence of "excess males" is one of the driving forces behind human trafficking and sexual slavery, not only in China but in surrounding nations as well.  Alarmingly, China also has the highest female suicide rate of any country in the world. According to the U.S. State Department China Human Rights Report, the number of female suicides has risen sharply in recent years, from 500 women per day to a staggering 590. I believe that this grim statistic may be in some ways related to pressure on women to selectively abort or abandon their daughters.  In India, the sex ratio at birth is 112 boys born for every 100 girls born. Indian girls, moreover, die of disease and neglect at a much higher rate than boys.  Impoverished women in India are often manipulated or pressured into sterilization, which is one way of population control. There are even mass "sterilization camps" where women sometimes die of complications. Just this week, in Chhattisgarh, one of India's poorest areas, 11 out of 83 women who were sterilized died.  This is the true "war on women" on a global scale.  That one-third of the world's womenthose living in China and Indiaare deprived of their right to bear girls is the biggest women's rights abuse on earth. These women deserve a passionate response from groups that stand for women's rights. Yet the response of the U.S. women's rights community has ranged from tepid to confused.  My organization, Women's Rights Without Frontiers, has launched the "Save a Girl" campaign in rural China, and we are stopping gendercide, one baby girl at a time.  We have fieldworkers in China who reach out to women who have learned that they are pregnant with or have just given birth to a girl, and are being pressured to abort or abandon her. A fieldworker will visit that woman and say, "Don't abort or abandon your baby just because she's a girl. She's a precious daughter. We will give you a monthly stipend for a year to help you support her."  The practical support we offer empowers these women to keep their daughters. Our effort has helped more than 120 families keep their daughters. We plan to launch a "Save a Girl" campaign in India in 2015 as well.  Every struggling mother in China and India deserves help to keep her daughter. Together, we can end gendercide one girl at a time and sweep sex-selective abortion into the dung-heap of history, where it belongs.

The whisky glows like a candle in the bottom of the glass. Its aroma is rich, deep, musky, inviting. But dare I take a sip?  This is the new Balvenie 50-year-old, which carries a price tag of 25,000 ($40,800) a bottle. Which means that the single dram I am holding is worth about 830 ($1,350).  Slowly, I raise it to my lips.  I am standing in the whisky room at the luxurious Cromlix hotel in Dunblaine, Scotlandwhich incidentally is owned by local boy tennis star Andy Murrayalong with a select group of journalists.  We have been invited to the exclusive launch of the new 50-year-old, which is only the fourth time the distillery has released a whisky of this age.  "A 50-year-old Macallan featured in (the film) Skyfall, but whiskies of this age are extremely unusual," says Sam Simmons, global brand ambassador for The Balvenie, who is introducing us to the latest release.  "Nobody 50 years ago knew that people would care about Scotch the way they do in 2014. Nobody planned to leave this whisky for so long. Its existence is a bit of a miracle."  We tilt our glasses. The butter-colored liquid is rich with notes of cloves, summer flowers, dried fruits and marzipan, underpinned by the woody polish of an old gymnasium.  "It tastes like soap," somebody says.  "You've eaten soap?" Simmons replies.  There is a pause.  "It reminds me of the inside of a grand piano," ventures someone else.  "Whisky of this age has a natural alcohol level of below 50%," Simmons explains. "That's when very unpredictable chemical reactions happen between the spirit and the wood. That's the magic time. It creates whisky that is unique, quirky and unpredictable."  Whisky collectors are making big money  As extraordinary as this whisky isit is exceptionally long, with flavor lingering for several minutes after each sipone question is in the back of everyone's mind. Who would pay 25,000 for a bottle of whisky?  The answer is people like Mahesh Patel, a whisky collector and building tycoon from Atlanta, Georgia, who once bought a Dalmore Trinitas 64-year-old for 100,000 ($166,000).  "I have about 5,000 bottles, including a lot of old, one-off, high-end whiskies," he says. "Over the years, I've spent about $2 million on it. The collection is worth about $6 million now. I keep it at different locations all over the world, for security reasons."  Patel is one of a breed of whisky collectors that have found that their passion for the drink has led to great financial gains. Distilleries first hit on the idea of limited editions and special releases in the early Nineties, such as the famous Black Bowmore that came in a wooden presentation case.  Collectors like Patel bought the bottles largely for the love of them. But over the decades, their value started to appreciate to the extent that unusual bottles started to be seen as cash cows.  Fast-forward to 2014, and the market is booming. According to the Investment Grade Scotch index that is compiled by UK-based Whisky Highland, the top 100 whiskies appreciated by an average of 440% in the last six years.  Last month, a 50-year-old bottle of Japanese Yamazaki single malt sold for 20,000 ($33,000). In January, Sotheby's sold a six-liter decanter of Macallan M for 387,000 ($631,000).  These transactions are becoming relatively frequent, if not commonplace. Indeed, Whisky Highland expect 30,000 bottles to be sold at auction this year, a 50% increase on the 20,211 that were sold in 2013.  By contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index increased by 31% in the same period, and the Live-ex Fine Wine 100 Index dropped by 2%. If you're a drinks investor with money to spend, it is something of a no-brainer.  Is whisky for collecting or drinking?  But most people in the whisky world see collecting purely for the sake of investment as something of a taboo.  "You have to start by drinking the product and enjoying the product," says Patel. "Buy two bottles, one to drink and one to collect. Otherwise you're going against the spirit of the industry."  Andy Simpson, the founding director of Whisky Highland, agreesbut only to a point.  "There are three types of buyers: drinkers, collectors and investors," he says. "I know one person, who shall remain nameless, who is teetotal, and buys whisky only to invest.  "Some people think that this is a crime and whisky should be set free. But from my perspective, people can choose how to spend their money. It's supporting the industry and that's a good thing."  Simpson, a former corporate banker, is launching a new business called Rare Whisky 101, which he describes as "consultants, brokers and valuers".  "Whisky has always been collectable, but there were no market figures before Whisky Highland came along five years ago," he says. "There were no indices, charts, graphs, nothing. Rare Whisky 101 will have the world's largest online database of whisky auction sales, so investors can accurately follow the market."  This is the latest contribution to the digital revolution that has transformed the secondary whisky market.  Physical auction houses like Bonhams and Sotherby's have traditionally tended to charge 25% commission, and hold auctions just a few times a year. By contrast, sites like Scotch Whisky, Whisky Online, Just Whisky and Whisky Auctioneer run online auctions regularly, and charge a commission of just 10%.  "Those sites have added liquidity into a traditionally illiquid market," says Simpson. "They are part of the reason why whisky is booming, and the growing value of whisky is starting to usurp the experience of opening and drinking it."  Whisky investment funds: too good to be true?  The market is gradually showing signs of maturity. In June, the world's first whisky investment fund was set up by Rickesh Kishnano, the CEO of Platinum Wines in Hong Kong; another has been established in Singapore.  But many seasoned collectorswho themselves have made millions through buying and selling whiskyare skeptical about whisky funds, and suggest that potential investors tread carefully.  "They worry me because genuine whisky experts are few and far between, and there is nobody credible behind these funds," says Sukhinder Singh, founder of the Whisky Exchange, who boasts a "handsome" private collection of 6,000 bottles that he keeps in his boardroom.  "They are run by people from the wine industry, but you need a lot of knowledge specifically about whisky to make good investments. It's not about just buying old whisky. I've been collecting for 30 years and I know everyone who is good. How many whiskies have these guys tried? Fifty? A hundred? That's not enough."  There are lots of hidden pitfalls, he says. For example, if you invest in a whisky that is not "amazing to drink", demand may remain low even if it is a limited edition. And while some bottles go up, it is common for others to lose value.  For example, the Royal Wedding limited edition Macallan whisky, which marked the marriage between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, rose from 150 to 1,650 by 2013. These days, however, after the distillery lost many fans by removing age statements from its bottles, it has depreciated to about 900.  By contrast, however, the iconic Macallan Private Eye whisky, which was released in 1996 to mark the 35th anniversary of the British satirical magazine, has appreciated from 35 to about 1,500, and shows no sign of falling from grace.  Telling the difference between these two whiskies requires significant expertise.  The importance of loving your whisky  According to Singh, when it comes to whisky collecting, there is no substitute for genuine passion. He still vividly remembers the first bottle in his collection.  "I visited a man in Scotland, and noticed a special bottle on his mantelpiece, with a beautiful, intensely colorful label," he says. "It was an original bottling from a distillery called Kirkliston, which had closed in the early 1900s.  "I knew I had to have it. It took me half an hour to persuade him to sell it to me, for 700, which was a lot of money at the time. It's worth about 20,000 now, but I'll never sell it."  What advice would he offer an aspiring collector or investor? "The whisky market is on fire at the moment, it really is," he says. "But you can't become an expert overnight.  "As a rule of thumb, buy limited edition bottles from iconic distilleries. But most importantly, learn about whisky, meet the experts and talk to them, and drink as much as you can."  Back in the honeyed presence of The Balvenie 50-year-old, Sam Simmons is inclined to agree. "Ultimately, whisky is about loving the mystery of the drink, conversation and friendship," he says.  "Whisky is to be drunk and enjoyed. However high the stakes get, you can never lose sight of that."

  Dylan Ryan and Danny Wylde knew each other onlineshe's read his blog, he's seen her tweetsbefore they met in person in Los Angeles a few weeks ago. A bit awkward, they made small talk, spending an hour or so getting to know each other.  "When I'm with someone new, my primary bit of nervousness is I have no idea if they'll like me, or be attracted to me, or be interested in me," Ryan says. "It's sort of akin to a first date situation."  But this wasn't a first dateit was strictly business. After chatting, Ryan and Wylde got to work, which in their case meant having sex. Ryan and Wylde (their stage names) are adult performers.  While hooking up with a new co-star can provoke some anxiety, there's one thing they're usually not anxious about: getting a sexually transmitted disease from their co-star, since both get tested for STDs at least once a month.  "Before you start shooting, you go online to see the other person's test results," Wylde explains. "Or sometimes on set, before you start, they show you the results on paper."  Such diligence about STDs is a good idea for anyone having sex with a new partner, even if you're not a porn star, says Dr. Craig Strafford, director of clinical research at the Holzer Clinic in Gallipolis, Ohio.  "It really shows they're thinking conscientiously," Strafford says. "I think it really works."  Talent Testing Service, which does STD screenings for adult performers, routinely tests for HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, according to Sixto Pacheco, president and CEO of the service. In addition, some performers opt for an additional panel of tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis.  So far, Ryan and Wylde say it's worked for them. Ryan says in her eight years as an adult performershe has about five sexual partners a month professionallyshe hasn't contracted a single STD. She says when she has sex with men outside work she always uses a condom. Wylde says about once a year he comes down with a case of chlamydia or gonorrhea.  "I take some pills and it goes away in a week," he says, adding that outside of work he has sex only with other performers, since he's knows they're regularly tested.  While the testing isn't foolproof, it lowers the risk of getting infected. Combine that with condom use and the risk goes down even more.  HIV is a particularly tricky test, since it may provide a false negative if taken too soon after a person is exposed to HIV. This is because most people don't produce enough antibodies for the test to detect until around a month after being exposed. Some people take three months or longer to produce detectable antibodies.  "I think about this all the time," says Ryan, who's been an adult performer for eight years. "It's by far the biggest risk in the industry. I think the one thing that gives me comfortsmall comfortis that the people I'm working with by and large have very strong safer sex practices because of what they do for a living."  Wylde says he's not too concerned about contracting HIV since he has sex only with women, but he adds that he knows he's taking at least a small risk.  "There's risk in a lot of jobs," he says. "Professional athletes take risks."  When beginning a new relationship, many wonder what diseases they should get tested for.  "It's a very common question, for both males and females," Strafford says.  Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nor the American Social Health Association has a list of STDs you should get tested for when you're about to have sex for the first time with someone. However, after discussion with various STD experts, here's a list of tests many doctors recommend.  They can be a starting point for a discussion with your doctor. The CDC has a list of clinics that offer testing for STDs by ZIP code.  Chlamydia  Often a simple urine test is all that is necessary; sometimes a swab must be taken from the infected area, according to ASHA.  Many people don't know they have chlamydia, the most frequently reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States. Complications among men are rare, but in women chlamydia can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancies. The disease can be easily treated and cured with antibiotics, according to the CDC.  Gonorrhea  This is also often a urine test, although sometimes a swab is taken from the infected area, ASHA says. Some men have no symptoms of gonorrhea, while others have painful urination or discharge from the penis, according to the CDC. Antibiotics can treat the disease, but if left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to infertility in men and women, and can be life-threatening if it spreads to the blood or joints.  Syphilis  A blood test is used to diagnose syphilis, a disease that's easy to treat in its early stages, but if left untreated can cause blindness or even death, according to the CDC.  Hepatitis A and B  Men who have sex with men should talk to their doctor about getting tested for Hepatitis A and B, and they should also be vaccinated against the diseases, says Dr. Hunter Handsfield, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD.  HIV  As noted above, you can be positive for HIV for several weeks or months before it will show up on most HIV blood tests.  A note about herpes  About one out of six people ages 14 through 49 have genital herpes simplex virus type 2, according to the CDC. Testing is controversial since the results are not always accurate or helpful.  Dr. Bradley Stoner, associate professor of anthropology and medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and a spokesperson for ASHA, says the best strategy might be to get tested if you have recurrent lesions that could be herpes, or if you're starting a new relationship with someone who has herpes, since drugs can be given to your infected partner to decrease the chances you'll get the disease, too.  "Other than that, I probably would not screen for herpesthe waters are just too murky," Stoner says.

Washington Remembering Wilma Mankiller, who died this week, isn't hard, because first of all, who can forget a name like that?  Wilma Pearl Mankiller. What a perfect name. Perfect, that is, after you've won two terms as leader of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and a Presidential Medal of Freedom, traveled the world, acquired celebrity friends like Gloria Steinem and become one of the most famous American Indians on the planet.  Not so perfect in 1969, when you're 25 years old and a soon-to-be-divorced mother of two living in San Francisco. Try making a dentist appointment with a name like Mankiller or Crow Dog or Pretty Shield: half the time people would think it's a crank call and hang up on you.  But that was the least of her problems. Wilma Mankiller's biggest problem was being an Indian in 1969. We were so square, and so invisible.  Why was she in San Francisco then, instead of Oklahoma? She had moved there with her family (she was one of 11 children) because the United States said there wasn't any future in Indians living on reservations. So it began a program imaginatively called Urban Indian Relocation, which moved Indians to cities. It wasn't a terrible idea, just a bad one, at least for most Indians.  Was life better in Cleveland or Dallas or San Francisco than life in Mescalero, Tahlequah, or Wanblee? Sometimes yes, usually no. The thing is, it wasn't clear where any of this was going. What was even the point of being Indian, anyway? Why can't there be a future back home? Why is being an unemployed aerospace worker in California better than being unemployed in Montana?  Mankiller may have been pondering these questions when something amazing happened. In a daring nighttime invasion, a few dozen Indian college students took over the abandoned federal prison on Alcatraz Island and reclaimed it on behalf of a group they had just invented, called Indians of All Tribes.  This was electrifying because Indians in those days did not stage daring nighttime invasions and break laws and trespass on federal propertyany property, for that matter.  That occupation of Alcatraz in November 1969 lasted for 19 months. Mankiller visited the ragtag settlement frequently, and said it changed her life. She wasn't the only one.  I moved to San Francisco in 1977, and met Mankiller and other "veterans" of Alcatraz. The occupation was endlessly debatedso many good and bad things happened during those monthsbut nobody argued how important it was, and how much had changed. We weren't so boring, and we were becoming visible. More than anything else, Alcatraz signaled new possibilities.  Wilma Mankiller saw them clearly and seized every one. She finished college, divorced, moved with her two daughters back to Oklahoma, and began her own series of audacious takeovers: running and revolutionizing community development projects for the tribe, then successfully running for principal chief of the Cherokee Nation. She served two terms and became an icon.  Just like Alcatraz, none of this was supposed to happen. Did I mention she was a woman? We Indians in the U.S. talk a good game about being matriarchal and so forth, but it was no accident that in the 20th century no woman had lead a major tribe before her. (The unofficial logo of the American Indian Movement was the Playboy bunny. Ha ha!) So she had no chance to lead her Nation, but did so anyway.  The other reason none of this was suppose to happen is her near-fatal car crash in 1979, her kidney transplant, her battles with breast cancer, lymphoma, and numerous operations. She beat them allall except pancreatic cancer. The health disasters were horrible and unrelenting, but I bet you dollars to donuts Mankiller would tell you it wasn't nearly as bad as the tribal politics.  Alcatraz feels like a million years ago. We have profitable Indian casinos and a Smithsonian museum and many strong women leading our tribes and communities. Indian college students are getting Ph.D.'s instead of criminal records. Some people, including me, wonder if we've lost the kind of daring that would lead college kids to break into an abandoned prison seeking some kind of justice, and a woman to find a calling there that would change a piece of the world.  And this is where I write she was tough as nails and one of a kind, and we won't see the likes of her ever again. It's all true, but there's something more. Her life made a new future possible one that is still unwritten.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Chaat Smith.  
 The mother of passenger No. 63 aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is unable to come out of the shadows of her son's misdeed to mourn with the rest of the families whose loved ones disappeared on March 8.  "As a human being, as a mother, nobody thought of me. I am alone with no support except for God," she wrote after CNN tried to contact her about her son.  She is suffering alone because she has shied away from the epicenter of information in Kuala Lumpur. She isn't there to attend the briefings, or to get the grief counseling provided by Malaysia Airlines. She is a mother whose son broke the law to get on the plane, and she is now paying for it.  Her son is 18-year-old Pouria Nourmohammadi. He and his friend Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, were the two Iranian men who boarded the Malaysia Airlines flight using stolen passports, investigators say.  They were two of the first people to come under suspicion in the plane's disappearance.  Malaysia Airlines says it has not been in contact with the families. Their case is in the hands of investigators, a company representative told CNN.  But investigators cleared them of any wrongdoing in connection with the disappearance of the plane early in the investigation.  Nourmohammadi's mother is acutely aware that her son did something illegal, but she says he just wanted to explore his "beautiful dreams."  "I dedicated my life to my sons, and all I wanted was for them to be happy in their life. I wanted them to live a free life. I had prayed that I would see him again, but that didn't happen. We will see each other in eternity now."  Going on after sudden loss of a loved one  She pours out her grief with pictures of her son, messages to him and symbols of their Christian faith posted on her Facebook page.  "... From the moment I became a mother, all I wanted and asked from God was to not see my children die before me. But of course that didn't happen," she wrote.  CNN met with a friend who dropped Nourmohammadi off at the airport on March 8 in Kuala Lumpur. The friend said that all Nourmohammadi wanted was to find "freedom." He boarded the plane with a plan to live in Germany with his mother and never return to Iran, his friend said.  His friend did not want to be identified for fear that being associated with the men traveling on stolen passports would make him a target for harassment by authorities when he travels in and out of Iran.  But he says Nourmohammadi's mother called him, looking for answers:  "She was so sad. She was asking me, 'When my son was there, was he happy? He was enjoying?'  "And I said, 'Yeah, as I see. He was happy and he was enjoying. He was OK.' Then she just said, 'Thank God.' "  Interpol has rebutted Malaysia's explanation for not checking an international database of lost and stolen passports when passengers boarded Flight 370, an omission that may have allowed Nourmohammadi and Reza onto the plane.  Malaysian Home Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told the Malay Mail Online last week that using Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD) database might have slowed down the process of immigration checks at airport counters.  He said the country's immigration equipment could not handle the global database of 40.2 million lost passports.  Interpol fired back, saying the problem cannot be blamed on technology or the agency.  "Interpol's SLTD database takes just seconds to reveal whether a passport is listed, with recent tests providing results in 0.2 seconds," the international law enforcement agency said in a statement.  "The fact is that the U.S. consults this database more than 230 million times per year; the UK more than 140 million times; the UAE more than 100 million times and Singapore more than 29 million times. Not one of these countries, or indeed any INTERPOL member country, has ever stated that the response time is too slow."  Nourmohammadi's Facebook message four days before he got on the plane shows him standing below an iconic Malaysian skyscraper with the words, "feeling excited."  He never made it to his final destination, just like the other passengers and crew of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.  Nourmohammadi's mother left this message, hoping it would not fall on deaf ears just because her son broke the law:  "Although he had a stolen passport," his mother said, "he was so young with many beautiful dreams. I'm a mother just like the Chinese mothers, and I want to know what happened too. I trust in God and whatever he wants will happen. But all 239 persons are the same, maybe somebody doesn't believe that."  6 missteps in the investigation  Read the cockpit transcript  Flight 370: High-tech search tools  CNN's Mitra Mobasherat and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.

It's the weekend. It's the World Cup. It's Brazil.  That makes three good, maybe even great, reasons to party.  And rest assured, there will be plenty of revelry Saturday in the land of samba. There always is, on any day. But that does not mean that harsh realities won't interveneperhaps related to protests, stadium problems or other issues that dogged the World Cup in the weeks leading up to football's biggest tournament.  Here's a look at five things to look out for Saturday, both on and off the field.  Two European football stalwarts face off  After one game Thursday and three on Friday, Saturday will be the first day with four World Cup.  While all offer intrigue in their own way, from a sports perspective, one stands out: England and Italy.  One of them, England, claims to have invented the sport though it can only claim one World Cup title, from 1966. Italy, on the other hand, won the most recent of its four championships in 2006.  History aside, there's no clear favorite in Saturday's contest.  Italy and England are about as evenly matched as they come, heading into the tournament ninth and tenth respectively in the FIFA world rankings.  Spotlight on stadium construction  But the story for the England-Italy tilt isn't just that they're playing, but where they are playing: in Manaus.  That's probably not the first place you think of, when you think of Brazil. The capital of the Amazonas state, it is more than 1,700 miles from Rio de Janeiro.  And critics have latched on to construction of a stadium in this relatively remote locale not just for its cost, but they also question its usefulness and point out potential danger. To the latter point, a man identified as Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira fell 35 meters to his death while working to build the stadium.  Stadium construction worker dies  His was the fifth death, nationwide, involved in the construction of World Cup venues.  There are also concerns that playing games in the thick of the tropics might put players' health at risk, once the games begin.  The forecast Saturday in Manaus calls for high temperatures in high 80s. Buteven if it is in the rain forestthere's not expected to be rain to cool things down.  Where not to find lush grass? The Amazon  Still, the game will go on Saturday at the Arena da Amazoniathat being the official name for the Manaus stadium.  Does that mean the stadium is ready for the spotlight? Not necessarily.  The British newspaper, the Guardian, reports that power cables hang from walls in locker rooms and that workers very recently put on a final coat of asphalt.  But the main focus, and concern, is about where all the action will take place on the field.  Pictures posted online showed a spotty patchwork of grass, looking dry and bare in spots despite it being set in one of the lushest regions in the world.  Numerous reportsand more photosindicate the grounds crew have been spraying the field green, to make the pitch look better.  White spray and goal-line technology  The funny thing is that having people spray the grass in the middle of a World Cup arena was supposed to be one of the biggest and best changes tied to the 2014 tournament.  Watch Saturday to see yourself: Referees now carry around a white spray they can use to mark, say, a line 10 yards from a free kick spot. It stays visible long enough to prevent players from creeping up, then vanishes soon after that.  Vanishing spray makes World Cup debut  That's not the only notable development in this year's World Cup.  Those who watched Friday's Chile-Australia contest saw the debut of a new system designed to track whether a ball crosses the goal line or not.  The system of cameras and sensors can follow the ball at a rate of up to 500 images per second and instantly alert a referee when it crosses the line.  Technology aims to get rid of 'ghost goals'  Every team has a story  Saturday's three other games, and six other teams besides England and Italy, have plenty of their own story lines as well.  For Greece, led by 34-year-old club journeyman Theofanis Gekas, it's about whether it can surge, as it did in winning the prestigious 2004 Euro tournament?  For Colombia, will goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon get on the field in his fifth World Cup to become the oldest player in tournament history? (He turns 43 later this month.)  For Japan, can it represent Asia wellas one of the continent's most well-respected teamsby overcoming Cote d'Ivoire, or the Ivory Coast, in a nighttime contest in Recife?  For Ivory Coast, can the 6-foot-3 Yaya Tourewho scored 20 goals in Manchester City's championship Premier League seasonmake an argument that he's one of the world's best attacking midfielders?  For Costa Rica, which cruised through qualifyingincluding handing the United States its biggest drubbingsurprise the skeptics and make its way through a packed Group D?  And can Uruguay successfully kick off its quest to go two-for-two in World Cups in Brazil, having defeated the South American superpower the last time the tourney was held here, in 1950?  Stay tuned.  
 New York Weather has delayed the scheduled Monday morning delivery of the final two sections of a 408-foot spire to the top of One World Trade Center, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  The two sections were scheduled to be delivered to the roof deck, as long as weather allowed on Monday. Once they are installed, they will make the building the tallest in the Western Hemisphere, according to the site's management.  The two pieces form a stainless steel beacon weighing almost six tons and will be the final piece put in place to give the building an iconic height of 1,776 feet, according to a news release from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  Once the architectural structure is complete, it will be comprised of 18 separate sections of steel and three communication rings. The firstand heavieststeel section was installed in January, weighing more than 67 tons, the news release said.  Port Authority Assistant Director of Media Anthony Hayes said the original design included a radomeshort for radar domebut that was rejected because of anticipated servicing and maintenance difficulties. The radome would not have impacted the height, but would have provided an additional design element, which ultimately proved impractical, Hayes told CNN.  The spire will serve a television broadcast facility housed in One World Trade Center, the press release said.  While under construction, One World Trade Center became New York City's tallest building a year ago, standing 1,271 feet above street-level. The building then was 21 feet higher than the Empire State Building's observation deck.

Susan Blake writes her son Joseph all the time. "I send him e-mails," she says, "keeping him updated on what's going on."  Each e-mail goes unanswered. All she can do is hope that he sees them.  It's how she copes with one of the most unsettling and baffling missing persons cases in recent years: the mystery of the McStay family.  Next week marks the third anniversary of the disappearance of Joseph McStay, 43; his wife, Summer, 46; and their two young children, Gianni, 7, and Joseph Mateo, who would be 6 this month.  February 4, 2010 was the last day anyone saw the family or heard from them. When police entered their Southern California house more than 10 days later, they found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room. Their two dogs were also in the home. But not a single trace of the McStays.  2010: California police search for missing family  Did they voluntarily leave? Are they in Mexico? Are they in danger? Are they dead?  Despite hundreds of tips and several high-profile television reports and interviews, no one has a clue.  "This is definitely an unusual case," says Lt. Glenn Giannantonio of the San Diego Sheriff's Department's homicide division "At this point we are no closer to finding them than on the day they disappeared. I know that sounds horrible, but we just don't know what happened to them."  The sentiment is shared by Dennis Brugos, who led the sheriff's department investigation into the McStays' disappearance before retiring last year. "Nothing makes any kind of rational sense that you can put together," Brugos says.  The McStays lived on a cul-de-sac in Fallbrook. Described on its website as the "friendly village," Fallbrook is about 18 miles from the Pacific Coast and some 50 miles north of San Diego.  Joseph McStay owned Earth Inspired Products, a company that built custom water features for high-end commercial businesses around the world, says Mike McStay, his younger brother. Summer stayed home to raise the children, but according to Mike was planning on getting back to work.  The family's locked and abandoned Isuzu Trooper was located February 8, 2010, in San Ysidro, just two blocks from the border. Surveillance video taken that night shows a family fitting the description of the McStays walking into Mexico.  "If you look at the clothing that they were wearing at the time, it coincides with when the vehicle was found; it leads you to believe that that was them crossing the border," Brugos says. "I can't say definitively it's them, but it's a high probability."  Giannantonio agrees. "We do believe the family on the tape going into Mexico is that of the McStays, " he says.  But Joseph's mother isn't convinced.  "My son's meds were in that car," she tells CNN. "My son has asthma and doesn't go anywhere without the meds on him. And to have babies go without car seats. This is the stuff that doesn't add up."  Mike McStay says he is not sure if the family is on the video. "The best is that the children appear to be size appropriate, but I could never get an ID off the adult. Even if it were them crossing, we still don't know to what intent. We don't know if it was under duress or willingly."  However, he says he believes someone has an answer. "How does somebody not see them?" he wonders. "They have to go get groceries, get the basic necessities of life; they have to have a way to generate an income. There has to be something.  "My brother is out there. I want what everyone wants, a phone call, a letter, something. I don't want to know why he left. We just have to know that they are OK."  Mike McStay is familiar with the theories speculating on what might have happened, including one presented in the new book, "No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family."  Author Rick Baker says his own investigation, including reviewing hundreds of personal e-mails, shows that Summer and Joseph were having problems and that their relationship was, in his words, about to "explode."  Baker speculates, among other things, that at least one of the family members may have met with foul play.  Mike McStay bristles when asked to comment on Baker's suggestion. "I don't know how he sleeps at night," McStay says of the author. "I suspect he's looking for money. He's a good manipulator and knows how to twist things. He's just trying to sell books."  Blake, the mother, says there were many inaccuracies in the book. "It was very hard to read all this, very heartbreaking, the accusations."  She says, "The bottom line for me is this book will bring focus to finding the family, sad to say."  Giannantonio cautions there is no evidence of any criminal activity. "Everything leads us to believe the disappearance is voluntary. It's still categorized as a missing persons case," he says.  "We have to rely on facts and evidence. We don't want to publicize unsubstantiated theories. Everyone has theories, however we can't come out and say this is what actually happened unless we have something to back that up. Other people can, but that's not the business we are in."  Brugos says he thinks anything is possible. "If you are staying together as a group, as a family of four, it's probably a little more difficult. If you want the kids to go to school, questions are asked, and with the Internet everybody is an amateur detective."  Mike and his mother get reported sightings of the McStays on a regular basis. They come from all over the country. Mike, who says he chases them all down, recently received a tip from Belize, where his brother owned property.  "Every time one comes your heart pumps and you hope to God that this is it," Blake says, "and when it's not you fall apart. It's heartbreaking and very hard."  She isn't giving up. Neither is Mike, though both are mindful that ultimately the truth could be devastating.  "Until my dying day I will try to resolve this thing. I have to know where my brother and my family are," Mike says. "I'm going to have to stick with this for the rest of my life. Until we have closure. So that we can have some peace. I know all of us need peace."  Blake says the search for her family is the biggest fight of her life. "I refuse to give up. I hope to God, but at the same time it's been three years.  "How can a family of four just disappear?"  
 On Wednesday the wrestling community and fans around the world mourned the passing of Ultimate Warrior, one of the biggest and brightest stars of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).  Born James Hellwig, before legally changing his name to Warrior in 1993, he is fondly remembered by many for his rivalries in the ring and for his trademark vivid face paint.  He died aged 54 and is survived by his wife and two daughters. The cause of his death is not yet known.  "WWE is shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the passing of one of the most iconic World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) superstars ever, The Ultimate Warrior," read a statement fron WWE, the modern incarnation of the WWF.  "Warrior began his WWE career in 1987 and quickly went on to become one of the biggest stars in WWE history. Warrior became WWE Champion at WrestleMania VI, defeating Hulk Hogan in an epic encounter."  Gallery: Best sports images of the last seven days  Ultimate Warrior's death came just days after he had been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. On Monday he appeared in the WWE's weekly Raw show.  Tributes to the former WWF world champion poured in from throughout the wrestling world, including from his former rival Hulk Hogan.  Triple H, real name Paul Michael Levesque, is one of the modern day WWE "superstars" and he also mourned the death of Ultimate.  During his appearance on Raw, Ultimate gave a poignant speech.  "No man becomes a legend on their own," he told the arena. "Every man's heart one day beats its final beat. His lungs breathe their final breath.  "And if what that man did in his life makes the blood pulse through the body of others and makes them believe deeper in something that's larger than life, then his essence, his spirit, will be immortalized by the storytellersby the loyalty, by the memory of those who honor him, and make the running the man did live forever."

A tax credit to help individuals and families buy health insurance is at the heart of a health care proposal Sen. John McCain unveiled Tuesday.  The credits will spark greater competition among insurance providers and put "individuals and families back in charge," the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said during a speech in Tampa, Florida.  "Millions of Americans would be making their own health care choices again," McCain said. "Insurance companies could no longer take your business for granted, offering narrow plans with escalating costs."  Under McCain's heath care plan, individuals would be eligible for a $2,500 credit and families a $5,000 credit to help pay for health insurance if they do not subscribe to, or do not have access to, employer-provided health care coverage. The government would send the money directly to insurers.  McCain's plan would cost $3.6 trillion over 10 years, the campaign said. McCain would pay for the program by eliminating the tax break employers get for offering insurance.  Doug Holtz-Eakin, a McCain senior policy adviser, said the tax credit would allow individuals to obtain health coverage "tailored to the circumstances of your life" rather than being forced to accept the insurance provided by an employer.  Watch McCain reject universal coverage   McCain also proposed that state governments set up a nonprofit Guaranteed Access Plan to provide coverage to individuals who are denied coverage from private insurers because of pre-existing conditions. McCain said he would work with Congress, governors and private industry to adequately fund the program.  Watch McCain say he wants a system accessible to everyone   Holtz-Eakin said McCain's willingness to work with the states to create individual programs in each state shows he understands a "better job doesn't take the form of a one-size-fits-all plan formed in Washington."  McCain argues that the increased competition will lower health care costs, which will allow more of the roughly 47 million Americans who are uninsured into the system.  The Arizona Republican would also permit generic drugs to be imported from Canada to increase competition among pharmaceutical manufacturers.  "We know competition and choice drive down costs," said Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO who is advising the McCain campaign.  Holtz-Eakin said the plan would also encourage insurers and health care providers to deliver better health and disease management as well as more preventive medicine such as anti-smoking programs, which he said would further reduce costs.  Health providers would be paid for "doing the right thing" rather than being paid for every test and procedure, he said.  In coordination with McCain's speech, his campaign released a television ad that touts the plan. In the ad, which is airing in Iowa, McCain says, "I can characterize my approach on health care by choice and competition, affordability and availability. ... The fundamental problem is not the quality of health care; it's the cost of health care. So, health care must be made affordable and available."  Watch McCain call for putting families in control   Critics of McCain's plan said the tax credits would not put a significant dent into what a family must pay to buy health insurance on their own. The average cost of providing health care for a family of four annually is more than $12,000, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.  For individuals with pre-existing conditions, the costs of obtaining insurance could even be higher, critics said.  Critics also said encouraging individuals to buy health insurance could undermine the system of employee-based health insurance, with no guarantee a new system would emerge to replace it.  Clinton picked up that argument while criticizing McCain, saying in a statement, "John McCain is proposing a radical plan that would mean millions of Americans would lose their job-based coverage."  "So while people might have a 'choice' of getting such coverage, employers would have no incentive to provide it," she said.  Fiorina, however, said McCain's plan would not undermine the employee-based health insurance system because employers would continue to offer health coverage to attract and keep quality employees.  McCain's free market approach to health care reform is very different from the proposals offered by the Democratic presidential candidates, Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Both of their proposals include more government mandates for health care coverage.  Clinton would mandate that every individual have health care and would provide government subsidies to those who could not afford to purchase insurance on on their own.  She would also allow individuals to join the private health care plans that are offered to members of Congress, and she would create a new public insurance program modeled after Medicare.  Clinton also includes tax credits to individuals to help buy health insurance and would require large businesses to provide or help pay for health insurance for their employees.  Watch McCain says he opposes mandates   Clinton's plan is estimated to cost $110 billion annually, which would be paid for by eliminating the Bush tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 and by eliminating waste and inefficiencies within the system.  Unlike Clinton, Obama would not mandate that every individual have health care insurance, but he would require health insurance for children.  As part of his plan, Obama would create a public insurance program for those not covered by private insurance and would also require large employers to help pay for their employees' health coverage.  Obama's plan is estimated to cost between $50 billion and $65 billion and, like Clinton's plan, would be paid for by eliminating the Bush tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 a year.

 Lagos, Nigeria Like his long-time hero Stevie Wonder, Nigerian music pioneer Cobhams Asuquo was born visually-impaired. And again, like the American R&B legend, the lack of sight was never enough to stop Asuquo from realizing his ambitions.  Instead, it only fueled his optimism and desire to achieve success.  "Being blind has played an integral role in forming who I am and I think to some extent is responsible for my optimism," says Asuquo, an award-winning music producer, song-writer and musician.  "When you feel there's nothing more to loseif you want to work towards anything, you probably will want to work towards gaining and I think that's what being blind has done for me."  A versatile musical talent, Asuquo has been pushing the boundaries of Nigeria's contemporary sound. His fresh mixture of different styles and beats has helped the west African country become one the continent's modern music hotspots.  "I fuse a lot of stuff to create my music" he says. "It variesit's jazz, it's classical, it's Afro, it's whatever, it depends on what best interprets the music."  'Ghana's Bob Marley' spreads message of brotherhood  Possessed of natural talent, the self-taught musician started honing his skills from an early age while growing up in a barracks.  As a young boy, he used to organize concerts in his neighborhood, drumming on his mother's barrels of water.  "All the kids from the neighboring block would come and we'd hang out and we'd make so much noise. I didn't realize at the time that I was preparing myself for what would be my life, my career path, my destiny," Asuquo remembers.  His musical journey, however, seemed to come to a halt a few years later when he entered university to pursue studies in law.  But Asuquo soon realized that he had to follow his musical passion, leaving university to embark on a path that, for a young blind musician in Nigeria, was far from easy to tread.  "(I had to) sleep on studio floors all across Lagos, worked at different studios, worked without pay, I've been out on the road, out on the streets, doing my thing," Asuquo recalls.  "I had to convince people that I could do itI had sessions that were canceled because they weren't sure I could deliver either because they thought I was too young or maybe as a blind person, 'how do we trust our music which is our future and investment?'" he adds.  But it didn't take long for Asuquo to prove himself as his musical talent soon began to shine. Over the next few years he went on to work closely with internationally-renowned artists such as pop sensation Asa and R&B star Darey and today he is a much-in demand producer operating from his own studio.  Meet Asa, African pop legend in the making  He is also a judge on Nigeria's "Project Fame," a television musical talent show where he helps young singers achieve their dreams.  "It's important for me to mentor and inspire fresh talent, to work with fresh talent," he says.  "I feel there is a lot I've learned in my journey as far as music is concerned and I'm in a position to share that knowledge."  But Asuquo is not only interested in helping out fledgling music stars. He also sees himself as an ambassador for blind young Nigerians who still face many challenges in their daily lives.  "I think it would be meaningless if I can achieve as much as I can achieve and as much as I hope to achieve and I'm not able to affect other blind people," he says.  "It is time to bring to the fore the needs of people with special needs and just how much they can contribute to growing Nigeria as a nation and the world."

Thomas Eric Duncan left Liberia for the United States, by official accounts, a healthy man. Just over two weeks later, he passed away at a Dallas, Texas, hospital with Ebola.  Duncan was admitted into isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28 with common symptoms of Ebola: fever, vomiting and diarrhea. He later tested positive for the virus that has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa.  He was started on the experimental drug brincidofovir on October 4far too long after he arrived at the hospital, his family has said. On Tuesday, the hospital reported that Duncan was on a ventilator and his kidneys were failing.  Duncan died on Wednesday at 7:51 a.m.  "His suffering is over," his partner Louise Troh said in a statement. "My family is in deep sadness and grief, but we leave him in the hands of God. Our deepest sympathies go out to his father and family in Liberia and here in America. Eric was a wonderful man who showed compassion toward all."  Who was Duncan, besides the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States? When did he start to feel sick, and why couldn't the U.S. health care system save him?  "The past week has been an enormous test of our health system, but for one family it has been far more personal," Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in a statement. "The doctors, nurses and staff at Presbyterian provided excellent and compassionate care, but Ebola is a disease that attacks the body in many ways. We'll continue every effort to contain the spread of the virus and protect people from this threat."  Who was Thomas Eric Duncan?  He was a 42-year-old Liberian citizen. Duncan's Facebook page indicates that he's from the Liberian capital of Monrovia, where he attended E. Jonathan Goodridge High School.  Why did he come to the United States?  To visit family and friends. Duncan was visiting his son and his son's mother in Dallas, according to Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother, who noted this was Duncan's first trip to America.  When did Duncan leave Liberia?  He departed the West African nation on September 19, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden says.  How did he get Ebola?  Health authorities haven't said.  Witnesses say Duncan had been helping Ebola patients in Liberia. Liberian community leader Tugbeh Chieh Tugbeh said Duncan was caring for an Ebola-infected patient at a residence in Paynesville City, just outside Monrovia.  The New York Times reported that Duncan had direct contact with a pregnant woman stricken with Ebola on September 15, days before he left for the United States. Citing the woman's parents and Duncan's neighbors in Monrovia, Liberia, the newspaper said Duncan had helped carry the ailing woman home after a hospital turned her away because there wasn't enough space in its Ebola treatment ward.  Was he screened for Ebola before getting on the plane?  Yes, according to Binyah Kesselly, board chairman of the Liberia Airport Authority.  "The first screening was at the gate, before you get to the parking lot. The second time is before you enter the terminal building and the third is before you board the flight. At every point your temperature is scanned."  His temperature at those checkpoints was a consistent 97.3 degrees Fahrenheit, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Thomas Frieden told reporters Thursday.  Yet on a health screening questionnaire, Duncan answered "no" to questions about whether he had cared for a patient with the deadly virus and whether he had touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease, Kesselly said.  Complete coverage on Ebola  When did his Ebola symptoms appear?  "Four or five days" after his trip, according to the CDC's Frieden.  This doesn't mean that Duncan actually got infected with Ebola in the United States. The incubation period for the virus is 2 to 21 days, meaning that a person could be infected with the disease for up to three weeks before showing any signs of it.  When he did seek medical help?  Duncan first walked into Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas after 10 p.m. on September 25.  Smallwood reports Duncan had a fever and was vomiting during this first visit to the Dallas hospital. The hospital, in a statement, said he had a "low grade fever and abdominal pain."  He underwent basic blood tests but wasn't screened for Ebola, said Dr. Edward Goodman from the Dallas hospital. Duncan left the medical facility after being given antibiotics and a pain reliever, his friend said.  "His condition did not warrant admission," the hospital said. "He also was not exhibiting symptoms specific to Ebola."  Were flags raised that Duncan might have Ebola?  After being asked by a nurse, Duncan did say that he'd traveled from Africa, said Dr. Mark Lester, executive vice president of Texas Health Presbyterian's parent company.  But that detailwhich might have raised an alarm that Duncan might have Ebola, since Liberia is one of the countries hardest hit by the viruswas not "fully communicated" to the medical team, according to Lester.  When was he admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital?  On September 28. By the time Duncan arrived via ambulance, "EMS had already identified potential need for isolation," the hospital said.  What treatment did he receive?  Duncan was given supportive therapymeaning fluids and other therapies that would help support his immune system while it was trying to fight off the virus. He was also started on the experimental anti-viral drug brincidofovir on October 4.  Since the drugs being used to treat Ebola are still experimental, it is up to each individual hospital to file the paperwork with the Food and Drug Administration for permission to get the drug from the manufacturer and use it.  The hospital has declined to tell CNN when they filed for permission to the FDA to use brincidofovir.  "The care team has been consulting with the CDC and Emory, on a daily basis since Mr. Duncan was admitted to the hospital, discussing the possible course of treatment, including the use of investigational drugs," hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said in a statement.  Family questions wait on experimental drug  Duncan was not given a blood transfusion with blood donated by an Ebola survivor, as Ebola patients Dr. Rick Sacra and Ashoka Mukpo were given in Nebraska.  Why did he die?  The other Ebola patients brought to the United States for treatment are still alive. Three have been released from the hospital and one is reportedly in stable condition at The Nebraska Medical Center. So what's different about Duncan?  As Lakey said, Ebola attacks the body in many ways. Experts estimate the current outbreak in West Africa has around a 71% fatality rate. Supportive therapy can help, but there are no proven cures for the disease.  Duncan did not start receiving treatment until several days after he started experiencing symptoms, which may have contributed to his rapid decline.  What will happen to his body?  An Ebola patient's body is still highly infectious. Any contact with the bodily fluids could result in transmission of the virus. "Only personnel trained in handling infected human remains, and wearing PPE (personal protective equipment), should touch, or move, any Ebola-infected remains," CDC guidelines state. "Autopsies on patients who die of Ebola should be avoided."  Duncan's body will be enclosed in two bags and the bags will be disinfected for transportation, Texas health officials say. Then the body will be cremated.  
 (The Frisky)You don't have to be Jennifer Aniston to think that the four women who Krazy-Glued a cheater's penis to his stomach were way harsh and beyond psycho.

Hamburg have put one foot in the UEFA Cup final after a header from Germany winger Piotr Trochowski proved enough to give them a 1-0 win at Bundesliga rivals Werder Bremen in the first leg of their semifinal.  Piotr Trochowski celebrates the only goal as Hamburg took a major step towards the UEFA Cup final.  Martin Jol's side scored the only goal of a pulsating match in the 38th minute when Trochowski, the smallest player on the pitch, rose superbly at the back post to head Guy Demel's right-wing cross past goalkeeper Tim Wiese.  Both side had countless half-chances to score but Hamburg wasted the best of them on the hour mark when Bayern Munich-bound striker Ivica Olic broke through in acres of space, but fired his shot straight at Wiese.  Hamburg's victory puts them on line for their first European final since 1983, when they beat Juventus 1-0 to win the European Cup.  This was the second of four matches in quick succession between the north Germany neighborswho met each other in the German Cup last week and will play the return leg of the semifinal next Thursday before a Bundesliga clash on Sunday May 10.  And the result was sweet revenge for Hamburg, who saw Wiese save three penalties in last week's shoot-out as Werder knocked their rivals out of the German Cup, also at the semifinal stage.  The eventual winners will play either Shakhtar Donetsk or Dynamo Kiev in May's Istanbul final.  
 United Nations The body of a United Nations worker, who had been missing for 24 years, has been found in eastern Lebanon, a representative of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday.  Alec Collett was on assignment for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, when he was kidnapped in Lebanon in 1985.  The British national was 63 years old at the time.  "Although he is saddened by Alec Collett's death, he hopes that the actions taken to find his remains can provide a measure of comfort to his loved ones," the statement from Ban's representative said.  Collett's abductors released two videotapes during his first year in captivity, in which Collett sent messages to his family, according to the U.N.  In April 1986, a Beirut television station received a videotape that purportedly showed Collett being hanged, but the United Nations said it was impossible to formally identify whether or not it was him.  Since then, nothing further had been heard about Collett's fate, despite repeated requests, the U.N. said.  Collett had been visiting various UNRWA operations in Lebanon as part of a three-month consultancy mission when he was kidnapped on March 25, 1985 in the midst of Lebanon's civil war while riding in a car near the Beirut airport, according to the U.N. His driver, an Austrian national, was also abducted, but later released.  Collett was the first U.N. employee to be kidnapped in Lebanon.  A group calling itself the "Revolutionary Organization of Muslim Socialists" claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. In the months that followed, several other UNRWA staff members were kidnapped, but later released.  Collett was married to an American, Elaine Collett, and their son Karim was 11 years old at the time of his kidnapping.  During his 35-year career as a journalist, Collett worked in Prague as a newspaper correspondent for several British publications after World War II, as well as an Associated Press reporter in New York and at the United Nations.

As many as 270 Libyan refugees were missing in the sea after the overcrowded boat they were in encountered bad weather, the Tunisian state-run TAP news agency reported.  The Tunisian coast guard responded to the rescue call regarding the fishing trawler, which became disabled Wednesday night near the Kerkennah Islands. The ship was reportedly taking some 800 refugees from Libya to the Italian island of Lampedusa, TAP reported.  An official told the agency that between 200 and 270 people were missing. At least two bodies had been recovered, the agency reported.  People on the boat began pushing each other in a panic to reach the lifeboats when they ran into high waves and winds, TAP said.  Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter the European Union.  More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February.  Lampedusa and Malta, both islands less than an hour's flight from the North African coast, have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration.  At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa, which numbers less than 6,000.

	 'A boat carrying 800 Libyan refugees was reportedly disabled Wednesday night near the Kerkennah Islands'
For Alex Zanardi, losing both legs in a life-threatening crash was only the beginning of a new chapter.  This year, the Italian racing driver, who has competed in Formula One and Indycar series, added two Paralympic gold medals and a win in the New York marathon's handcycle division to his career highlights.  Reflecting on what lies next, he says: "I have to tell you that the possibilities are not lacking in my life, and this is something for which I feel very lucky."  At school, Zanardi didn't compete in sports much, "because I was really fat as a kid."  After his sister was killed in a car crash his parents were eager to keep him off the roadbut they did allow Zanardi to race go-karts.  "I clearly remember that first day on the go-kart being the best in my life," he says.  Zanardi first raced in Formula One in 1992. After a contract with Lotus ended, he switched to Indycar racing, ultimately winning two championships.  In America he became a popular driver, making a signature move out of performing post-race donuts on the track, and earning the nickname Latka (a reference to a character in '80s sitcom "Taxi").  The crash  In 2001, Zanardi was leading in a Champ car race at Lausitzring in Germany, with 13 laps to go. But as he emerged from a final pit-stop, something went wrong.  "I lost control of the car in the acceleration lane, spun around and basically ended up ... a sitting duck in the middle of the racing line."  Zanardi awaited his fate as his fellow drivers sped by at more than 350mph.  Struck by the second car to pass, his carand his bodywere effectively sliced in two.  The blood loss was massive. "It was like having the sink opened," he says. "Both arteries were completely ripped apart; the amputation was immediate."  As a racecar driver, he'd had plenty of opportunity to ponder how he would react to such a fate. "I said I would probably kill myself," Zanardi says. "Then I found myself in this situation and that thought never went through my mind."  "I had a clear perception that I had cheated death. I was very happy, and full of joy at being alive."  Friends and family worried about how he would manage to get by without legs. But Zanardi says the question he asked himself on emerging from a coma was "not that much different in the wording, but technically very different."  It was: "My question was, how the hell am I going to do all the things I have to do with no legs?"  His attitude was one of "pure curiosity." "I knew I was going to find a way to overcome my problems," he adds.  More from Human to Hero: From builder to Pritzker-winning architect  Being a professional athlete served Zanardi well during his rehabilitationhe already knew that it simply takes persistence to achieve a good result.  "Having been involved in sport a long time made me learn that you cannot magically make things happen overnight. You can only do what you can each day, and take the next day to add to what you have done the previous day."  "The method which allowed me to get out of my troubles was setting a list of priorities, as I did previously in sport, preparing a race."  "My first goal was to try to get out of that bed, and then to get rid of all those tubes and wires that were keeping me alive. Then go on the toilet on my own and then, step-by-stepvery metaphorical in my caseslowly, I got to the point of thinking about rehabilitation over a pair of prosthetic legs."  The comeback  Within a year, he had crossed all of those problems off his list.  Two years later, Zanardi returned to Lausitzring to complete his 13 laps, averaging nearly 200mph in a hand-operated car.  Three years later, he was contracted to race for BMW in the European Touring Car Championships.  Four years later, he won a World Touring Car Championship race, using his hip to work a modified brake pedal attached to a prosthetic leg, an accelerating device mounted under the steering wheel, and a clutch mechanism worked by hand. He celebrated by doing donuts on the track.  Five years later, he was back in a modified BMW Formula One car, steering with one hand and accelerating with the other.  He was again subject to the same dangers, but says "life itself is that way." "The simple fact that we are alive and breathe means we have something to lose. In this philosophical way, I found it absolutely normal to jump back in the car and do things as I did before.  "I knew that if there was a way to connect my brain to the racing car, I would be the same driver as before."  If anything, he says, he is now less vulnerable than before: "If I break one of my legs, it only takes a 4mm screw to fix it."  More from Human to Hero: Opera singers are athletes  Handcycling  It was an invitation to speak at the 2007 New York marathon that first inspired Zanardi to try handcycling. "I thought, since I'm there, I may as well do the marathon," he says.  With only a month's preparation, he finished fourth in his division, discovering that, not only was handcycling a great way to keep fit, but it also allowed him to apply his knowledge of aerodynamics.  By 2009, he had a new goal in his sightsthe London 2012 Paralympic Games. As well as physical training to prepare, Zanardi spent hours working as his own race engineer, fine-tuning his cycle until it perfectly complemented his body.  "Every athlete has different needs, because every athlete has different residual abilities ... you have to modify in order to find the perfect machine for you."  Just as a racecar driver must interpret what the instruments on his dashboard reveal, Zanardi says he also had to learn to interpret his own body's inputs and outputs.  "There's nothing you can do about power in a racing car, other than telling your engineers your engine doesn't sound or feel as good as it should ... here, I'm the engine. I need to be aware of what's going on ... "  A year after winning the handcycling division of the New York Marathoncompleting the race in one hour, 13 minutes and 58 secondsZanardi won golds in both the H4 men's road and time trial races at the Paralympics.  Victory was sweet, but being a paralympian was also fulfilling because, Zanardi says, "finally, I saw people realizing what kind of message can come out of sport in general."  "You are surprised by the result they're achieving, but you can't help but think, the starting point for these guys was much further back than yours."  
 Power returned slowly to Venezuela on Tuesday night, a few hours after widespread outages blacked out nearly half the country, trapping people in elevators, stalling subways, filling streets with pedestrians and forcing hospitals to switch to emergency generators.  The streets of Caracas, Venezuela, are thronged with people during Tuesday's power outage.  "We understand that at 1600 hoursthat is to say at 4 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET)there was a blackout on a national level that was produced by an explosion, which is being investigated" in the Guri hydroelectric power station, Caracas Mayor Juan Barreto said.  "That produced a blackout in 16 states of the country, particularly those of the central north coastal area."  The city's emergency plan kicked in, and about 400 firefighters in training had reported for duty to help, he said. City firefighters had gone to 37 buildings in the capital to free people from elevators.  The head of the country's electric authority, Hipolito Izquierdo, told state-run Venezuelan Television that 60 percent of the power had been restored by 7 p.m. local time (7:30 p.m. ET) and predicted that power would be fully restored before 9:30 p.m. (10 p.m. ET).  "We are now recovering," he said.  Minister of Interior and Justice Ramon Rodriguez Chacin blamed a fault in a generator at the plant in Guri, which caused a high-voltage power transmission line to overheat. In taking the line out of service, power was disrupted to other areas, he said.  In all, about 40 percent of the country was blacked out, officials said.  Affected zones included parts of the capital city of Caracaswhere streetlights were darkand the states of Zulia, Lara, Carabobo, Yaracuy, Portuguesa, Miranda, Falcon, Merida, Aragua, Bolivar and Tachira, the station said.  Gustavo Gonzalez, the president of Caracas Metro, the city's rapid-transit system, said it was functioning normally. But a ticket seller at one station said train service had been halted and riders were being diverted to buses.  "Normally, these blackouts don't occur very often," said Javier Alvarado, president of Caracas Electricity. E-mail to a friend

Washington President Barack Obama announced Friday that Ash Carter is his pick to replace outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.  "With a record of service that has spanned more than 30 years, Ash is quietly regarded as one of our nation's foremost national security leaders," Obama said Friday from the White House's Roosevelt Room, with Carter standing by his side.  Carter himself said that it was an "honor and a privilege" to be nominated.  "If confirmed in this job, I pledge to you my most candid, strategic advice. I pledge also that you will receive equally candid military advice," Carter said.  Hagel was scheduled to attend the ceremony as of Thursday night, but decided he wouldn't attend the ceremony, a Pentagon official told CNN on Friday.  "The Secretary believes strongly that this day belongs to Ash Carter and his nomination to be the next Secretary of Defense," the official said. "As Secretary Hagel knows better than most, today is a day that is to celebrate Ash, his family, and all that he will accomplish. The Secretary is proud of Ash and of their friendship and does not want in any way to detract from or distract the proper focus of the day."  Carter is a well-decorated national security official who also is a former deputy defense secretary. The Philadelphia native has on several occasions been awarded the Department of Defense Distinguished Service Medalthe department's highest honorand has received multiple medals for his contributions to intelligence.  In addition to his service in national security, Carter also has a long list of academic accomplishments, ranging from a stint as professor and chair at Harvard's Kennedy School, to a physics instructor at Oxford.  Carter was previously unanimously confirmed by the Senate for his deputy defense secretary job. So far, reaction to the potential nomination from Congress has been generally positive, with both Republicans and Democrats vocalizing support for his nomination.  
 In her new book "10-10-10," Suzy Welch advocates a fast and reasoned approach to decision making by asking readers to think about the impact their decisions will have in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years.  Suzy Welch, right, developed a decision-making process before marrying former GE CEO Jack Welch.  The business writer, whose work appears in BusinessWeek and O: The Oprah Magazine, spoke with CNN about whether her method could have prevented the financial crisis, what Oprah would think of her mistrust of gut reactions and how to avoid becoming a clich from a Talking Heads song.  An excerpted version of that interview is below:  CNN: Could you start off by explaining what 10-10-10 means?  Welch: It's a way of infusing intentionality and deliberateness into your decision making so you are living your life instead of your life living you.  It impels you to do a values excavation, where you have a very candid conversation about what really matters to you: who you are, who you want to be.  Then you take each decisioneach messy decision, each complicated decision; it's not about "Where do we go to dinner?"and you consider the consequences of your options in the immediate future, 10 minutes, in the foreseeable futurethat's the 10 monthsand then the distant futurethat's the 10 years.  CNN: How does that compare with other decision-making methods, say, like, going with your gut reaction or flipping a coin?  Welch: Gut's got its moment. There's a story in the book about when gut saved my life. I think gut is no way to live your life. Gut is a not-transparent, relatively inconsistent method for building a life of your own making.  Now, the problem with gut is that good decision-makers are made, not born. If you ask a neuroscientist what gut is, [he or she would say] some of our gut reactions are hardwired on the savanna plain at the beginning of humankind.  So, paralysis in moments of fear. The sort of selective deafness we have: only listening to people that we like. Not breaking from the group. There are hardwired neurological responses that always the best decision options.  So I say, listen to your gut. But do a 10-10-10, and if there's a gap, figure out why.  Watch Suzy Welch talk about decision-making paralysis   CNN: So if these gut reactions have evolved over time, is this sort of decision-making process then going against what we've evolved to do?  Welch: It is a shortcut to wisdom. So, in fact, when you meet somebody who's really, really wise and you ask them how they make decisions, you often hear them describe a form of 10-10-10.  It takes a lot of courage to turn to your parents or to turn to your spouse and say, "Actually, this is not my beautiful life." I'm just quoting that Talking Heads song, but you can wake up when you're 40 or 35 and say, "Oh, my God, I lived the last 10 years for someone else."  This is a way to avoid that.  CNN: Does this work for everyone?  Welch: I've yet to see it not work. I've talked to many, many people now who use it. Here's where it falls apart: It falls apart in the execution of it. Because people will make a great 10-10-10 decision and then not have the courage to live it.  CNN: If everyone used 10-10-10, do you think we'd be in the financial crisis we're in?  Welch: The reason we're in a financial crisis is because some people did things without integrity. 10-10-10 is so based on having good values. If your values hurt other people for your own financial advancement, a good 10-10-10 decision isn't going to undo that.  Had people been playing to their better angels and used 10-10-10 in the financial crisis, yeah, we probably could have avoided some of it.  CNN: What's the hardest decision you've ever had to make?  Welch: I write about it in the book. It was my divorce ... Just technically speaking, the decision to end a marriage, there's just almost nothing harder.  CNN: Are there any decisions you regret?  Welch: Oh, I have a billion of them. That's why 10-10-10 came to be, because I was regretting too many decisions.  Since I started using 10-10-10, I think that I've gotten my decision making in a great place. I don't want to say that with any kind of hubris, because I make mistakes all the time, because I'm human. I'm all too human, I guess.  But, you know, there's no 10-10-10 decision I regret. ... I don't regret the marriage that I ended, because I have four fabulous children because of it, but perhaps I should have ended it earlier.  CNN: In the long term, do you think there are bad decisions? Because like with that one, you're saying there are good things that come of it. You learned something.  Welch: The great thing about the human condition, OK, is that life goes on. And there are good things that come out of bad. But there are bad decisions that stall you for years. And there are decisions that we make way too late. And if anything what 10-10-10 does is that it expedites good decisions. ... If anything, 10-10-10 encourages us to start living our lives sooner.  CNN: You write for O magazine, right? I've heard Oprah talk about gut reactions and trusting yourself. Do you think she would agree with you [on 10-10-10]?  Welch: You know, I don't know how she would feel about it. The book says very clearly that gut has its place. Gut is pattern recognition. I'm not going to denigrate gut. Sometimes our gut is our inner voice. And I don't say "don't listen to it." What I'm saying is, "backstop it." What I'm saying is, "uncheck it." What I'm saying is, "unpick it."  Sometimes gut is great, and sometimes gut is just easy.

Things have been messy between singer Chris Brown and his now ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran, and it looks to be about to get messier.  Oprah Winfrey's network, OWN, posted a teaser Tuesday for Tran's interview with Iyanla Vanzant. The inspirational speaker and host of "Iyanla: Fix My Life" fires off at Tran: "He betrayed you. He lied to you. He did it all publicly," before asking, "How did you find out that he had a baby by another woman?"  Brown has been the subject of rumors that he fathered a daughter with another woman while in a relationship with Tran. He has neither confirmed nor denied the stories, but the story heated up when Tran tweeted on March 4, "Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me."  The tweet was later deleted.  Brown and Tran have had an on-again, off-again relationship for years. In 2012, Brown posted a video on Twitter questioning whether it was possible to be in love with two people. At the time, the singer had broken up with Tran after once again growing close to singer Rihanna, whom he assaulted while they were dating in 2009.  "I love Karrueche very much but I don't want to see her hurt over my friendship with Rihanna," Brown said in the video. "I'd rather be single allowing us to both be happy in our lives."  Brown and Rihanna eventually reunited but then broke up again, and he and Tran, who bills herself as a model and entrepreneur, resumed seeing each other.  On Wednesday, Brown commented from his Instagram account on a racy photo Tran posted of herself in a swimsuit while on vacation. The singer advised her to "Continue to be a lady beautiful."  Vanzant's interview with Tran airs at 8 p.m. ET March 28.  
 Adam Scott hopes his third Singapore Open title triumph on Monday will act as a springboard for an assault on golf's four major tournaments next year.  The Australian completed a final-round 68 after the tournament went into a fifth day following weather disruptions, finishing on 17-under-par 267three shots clear of Denmark's second-placed Anders Hansen.  The victory, his first at Sentosa since the Asian Tour event became co-sanctioned by the European Tour last year, launched him back into the top-20 of golf's world rankings.  It was the seventh European Tour title of the 30-year-old's career, and he will now turn his attention to claiming a maiden major title in 2011.  "You just want your game to be in good shape when you get to Augusta [the Masters] or the U.S. Open, the British Open, PGA Championship," Scott told the tournament's website after following up his 2005 and 2006 successes.  "I haven't prepared myself very successfully over the past years, but I sit back at the end of every year and look back at what I've learnt and how I can do things better.  "If I need to do them differently, I'll do that in a couple of weeks when the season's over."  The Adelaide native reached the top-10 of the rankings in 2005 and the following year achieved his best finish at a majortied for third at the U.S. PGA Championship.  He spent over 180 weeks among golf's elite, but his form deteriorated in the following few years and he dropped out of the top-50 in 2009.  Scott was happy with the form he showed in the rain-affected tournament at the Sentosa Golf Clubhis second success of 2010 after winning the PGA Tour's Valero Texas Open in Mayalthough he admitted to finding the harsh weather conditions challenging.  "It was a great win but it was a tough week for us. Testing weather conditions with delays and even when we were on the course, it can get uncomfortable at times as it was not easy to play," he said.  Defending champion Ian Poulter endured a frustrating final round of 73, slipping to a tie for sixth on 11-under after starting the day only three shots behind Scott.  His Ryder Cup teammate Graeme McDowell shot 70 to finish joint third alongside Sweden's Rikard Karlberg (67) on 14-under.  Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez (66) shared eighth place with Keith Horne of South Africa (68) , with European Tour money-list leader Martin Kaymerthe 2010 U.S. PGA championdown in 10th after closing with 69.

Roger Federer suffered a stunning upset defeat to John Isner as the United States took a 2-0 lead Friday in their Davis Cup World Group first round match in Switzerland.  Home favorite Federer was in action for the first time since losing to Rafael Nadal in the semifinals of the Australian Open and could find no answer to an inspired Isner, who won 4-6 6-3 7-6 6-2.  It followed an earlier 6-2 4-6 4-6 6-1 9-7 win for Mardy Fish over Stanislav Wawrinka in the first rubber of the tie.  World No.3 Federer was expected to tie it up on the indoor clay court in Fribourg, which was selected by the Swiss hosts, but Isner, best-known for his marathon match against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon, again showed his aptitude on the slower surface.  Spain fury over drugs slur  After dropping the opening set, the American took the next three to close out victory in two hours 40 minutes, ending a 15-match winning streak for Federer in the Davis Cup.  "The way I played today is the way I need to play in all my matches," said Isner after his surprise victory.  "I owe it to Jim Courier (American Davis Cup captain)he was on at me to hit all my shots. It's the win of my life."  Fish, despite his higher ranking, was not favored against Wawrinka, but showed his fighting qualities in a four hour 26 minute match.  He played superbly in the fourth set to level the match for the loss of a single game and always looked the stronger in the 16-game decider.  "I lost a couple of long ones in Austin last year, and that feels so bad I just needed to win this one.' Fish told the official Davis Cup website.  Wawrinka and Federer will pair up for Saturday's doubles where they will take on Mike Bryan and teenager Ryan Harrison.  Meanwhile, holders Spain took a 2-0 lead over Kazakhstan after the opening day of their first round tussle in Oviedo.  With World No.2 Rafael Nadal missing the tie for the home team, it was left to Juan Carlos Ferrero and Nicolas Almagro to step up to the plate.  Veteran Ferrero needed five sets to beat Mikhail Kukushkin 6-1 4-6 7-6 4-6 6-4 while Almagro eased past Andrey Golubev 6-3 4-6 6-1 6-1.  
 Texas Rangers President Nolan Ryan is calling a Tuesday night incident in which a baseball fan fell about 30 feet from the second deck of Rangers Ballpark trying to catch a foul ball an unfortunate accident.  "It's pretty hard to guard against something of that nature," Ryan said at a Wednesday news conference.  Some guard railings in the stadium had been raised after a 1994 incident in which a woman suffered multiple injuries after falling 35 feet from the upper deck while posing for a picture, according to a report published in the Star-Telegram on April 15, 1994.  Ryan said safety policies in the stadium were reviewed after Tuesday's incident and that the second-deck railings measure more than 30 inches high, above the standardized code of 26 inches.  Ryan said the man who fell Tuesday night, Tyler Morris, was in good spirits when Ryan visited with him Wednesday at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.  Ryan said Morris, a firefighter with the Lake Cities Fire Department in Corinth, Texas, has fractures to the skull, foot and ankle, but hasn't lost his enthusiasm for the team.  "I was expecting him to look a lot worse then he did. I think being a firefighter, and being in the shape he is, worked in his favor," Ryan said.  He said Morris has some recollection of what happened.  "He thought he was going to catch the ball," said Ryan. "He said it hit the tip of his finger. The next thing he knew he was falling."  Ryan said Morris remembered hitting the electronic message board at the stadium, but nothing after that. Ryan said he doesn't believe Morris jumped to get the ball, but said he probably extended himself, or reached for it, before falling over the second-deck railing.  Ryan also said he and other members of the Rangers organization brought Morris several autographed items when they visited him at the hospital, including the ball that he was trying to catch when he fell.  "He was as thrilled to get that as anything else we brought him," Ryan said.  "He's a die-hard Rangers fan, and grew up a Rangers fan. He was real appreciative that we came to visit him," Ryan said.  Wednesday morning, the Morris family issued a statement that said Morris is expected to make a full recovery, according to CNN affiliate KTVT/KTXA,  Morris is lucky to be alive, according to an off-duty paramedic who was one of the first people to come to the man's aid.  "The fall could have easily killed the guy," Derek Dilday said. In an interview with HLN, Dilday said he rushed to the man's aid after witnessing the entire incident.  "I turned to my left to watch the foul ball, and I saw this guy reach over the railing. Then I saw his feet go up, he tried to reach back for the railing, but he missed it. He hit the video-tron (electronic message board), then fell the rest of the way like a rag doll."  "It was the most shocking thing I had even seen," he said.  Dilday said he ran about 50 feet to get to the spot where Morris had fallen.  "He was laying in the aisle on his back. There was no external bleeding, which was a good thing. I held his head and tried to keep him still until the medics arrived."  Dilday said Morris was having difficulty breathing but was trying to move. "He tried to move his neck, he tried to get up, I kept telling him, 'Stay still, stay still.'"  By the time medics arrived, Morris was able to say his name, Dilday said.  "He was able to move all his extremities and was responsive to the paramedics," Rangers spokesman John Blake said.  Morris fell on top of four other fans, causing minor injuries to them, said Ryan. "One woman had a bruised knee, one man had a bruised shoulder, someone was hit by Morris's shoe," he said. "They chose not to go to the hospital emergency room and were treated in the stadium's first aid area," Ryan said.  All stayed for the remainder of the game, he said.  The game between the Texas Rangers and Cleveland Indians was delayed for 16 minutes after the fall. The Rangers eventually won, 12-1.  CNN Sport's Adam Anshell contributed to this report.

Finally. Finally. Finally, a strong important voice in the world, the United Nations, speaks out on behalf of the rights of children and condemns the Vatican and the bishops for crimes of violence, rape and sexual abuse against children by transferring pedophile priests from parish to parish, withholding documents for prosecution and perpetuating an institutional culture of secrecy and shame.  What's truly shameful is that the Catholic Church was not itself that strong and important voice, protecting "the least of these." It's shameful that in spite of Pope Francis' refreshing compassion toward the poor and downtrodden, to date he has not addressed the issue fully. Pope Francis is caught up in the shame and like most of his brother bishops, seems unwilling to say, "Enough is enoughnot ever again in our church will one of these little children be harmed."  The media have said the church is suffering from a "code of secrecy." Kirsten Sandberg, the chairwoman of the United Nations, put it this way: "We think it is a horrible thing that is being kept silent both by the Holy See itself and in local parishes. "  As a survivor of rape and violence at the hands of a priest when I was a young girl, I understand that secrecy.  I went silent at age 7 and became a part of the secret code that no one could unlock in me, because there were always pieces missing. For the rest of my childhood I really wasn't there. I split and left a part of me behind in shame and secrecy.  It has taken me more than half a lifetime to piece myself back together. I was 52 years old and still captivated by the Catholic Church when I let the buried "secret" memories emerge. His name was Father RuckerGeorge Neville Rucker. I must have trusted him when he asked me to crawl up on his lap as he sat watching a movie in an auditorium so long ago. He raped me while my mother was in the lunchroom nearby.  The tragedy hereamong othersis that Mom died before I was strong enough to tell her about that terrible day. We missed out on conversations about intimacy and love because I would always shut down and disconnect. Rape robbed me and my family of so much that matteredlike truth and honesty between us.  After high school at age 18, I entered the convent of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary in Santa Barbara, California, and remained there as a nun for 15 years. Detaching from the destructive invasion of Father Rucker into my body and soul allowed me to hold onto God and to the sisters I loved. Very simply, that is how I was able over half a lifetime to remain in the Catholic Church until the day I awakened to the tragedy of the little girl whom I once was.  The Archdiocese of Los Angeles released 12,000 pages of files on scores of priests accused of sexually abusing children in 2013. I found out that the pastor of our parish back in 1947 suspected Father Rucker of "touching" little girls. It was the bishop who would not listen and passed Father Rucker on and on until 2002, when he was defrocked. He had become a real liability to Cardinal Roger Mahony, head of the archdiocese.  About 33 women accused him of abusing them when they were young. That's five decades of abuse.  In 2002, he was charged with 29 counts of molesting girls. He was taken off a cruise ship on its way to Russia to face the charges; authorities thought he was trying to flee. But his case was dismissed in 2003 after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the charges were too old.  It is easy to think that when we talk about the crisis of child rape and abuse that we are talking about the pastand the Catholic Church would have us believe that this most tragic era in church history is over. It is not. It lives on today. Pedophiles are still in the priesthood. Coverups of their crimes are happening now, and bishops in many cases are continuing to refuse to turn information over to the criminal justice system. Cases are stalled and cannot go forward because the church has such power to stop them. Children are still being harmed and victims cannot heal.  These criminal acts happened over and over to tens of thousands of children in the past, continue now and will continue until Pope Francis and the bishops act fiercely to insist that children and their safety come first, and that priests and protecting the image and power of the Catholic Church come a distant second.  Pope Francis must take action and mandate every bishop to immediately defrock any priest who has sexually abused children in the past or in the present and let the civil authorities investigate any priest or bishop alleged to have sexually abused a child. It's common sense. Nothing else will show the world that the Catholic Church is serious about its promise to address this issue.  Pope Francis will need to begin at home and release whatever records the Vatican possesses on priests and bishops accused of these crimes, wherever they are in the world. Anything short of this speaks of lip service and platitudes.  Francis also needs to chastise and demote bishops guilty of protecting priest abusers and working against the criminal justice systemnot honor and promote them. Cardinal Mahony was recently honored in celebrating Mass with Pope Francisand yet it is documented that he withheld information and transferred priests within and outside his diocese. At least Mahony acknowledged in a statement in 2013 that he had been "naive" about the lasting impacts of abuse and then met with 90 victims. But Pope Francis' speeches and actions to date do not reflect a spirit of compassion for, or understanding of, the impact on survivors.  Any positive changes in the Catholic Church to protect children and hold the church accountable have come about largely because of the tireless work of SNAP, Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests. These are brave and courageous men and women who tell their stories of abuse without shame. We can also thank the Catholic community of laypeople who want their children to be safe and their church to become the church it can be: a beacon of hope for its members and the world.  Now, it's the Vatican that must take action, as the U.N. report urges, to show us that its apologies are matched by actions to both stop the abuse of children and the church's coverup.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Dispenza.  
 Madrid Tens of thousands of protesters converged on central Madrid Sunday as the so-called May 15 movement pushing for political and social change in Spain again took to the streets.  Madrid's was the first major demonstration of the day and drew some 37,000 people, Spain's state-run news agency reported, citing a consulting firm it hired to estimate the size of the crowd.  Protests were planned in 55 other Spanish cities later in the day and had gotten underway in Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and other cities, Spanish media reported.  The protests focused again on Spain's 21% unemployment rate and on the government's economic austerity measures. But on Sunday, they also rallied against European Union efforts to stabilize the euro, with many protesters worried that could lead to more austerity measures across the EU.  The movement takes its name from the opening round of large protests on May 15 of this year. On Sunday, it unveiled a new tactic in Madrid, when six columns of marchers started in the north, south, east and west of the capital. They walked noisily through neighborhoods, carrying banners and shouting slogans and quickly adding more protesters in a steady march to the Neptune plaza near the parliament building.  GPS: The perils of public debt  A throng of riot police stood by to protect the national parliament, days after violent scuffles occurred between demonstrators and police outside the Catalonia regional parliament in Barcelona last week.  "This capitalistic system doesn't work. It's an unfair system and a lot of people are in a very bad situation, without money," said Eva Fernandez, a social worker who was marching with the "northern" column down Madrid's main boulevard, la Castellana, on Sunday.  Protesters on June 12 dismantled a sprawling tent camp in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol plaza, nearly a month after it sparked large nationwide demonstrations and similar encampments in other cities to demand changes in Spain's political and economic system.  "The main thing we've achieved so far is to gain legitimacy to be able to protest and demonstrate in the streets," said Josua Serrano, a communications worker also marching in the "northern" column. "This civil disobedience is being practiced in a lot of countries now through nonviolent direct action. So people are going to the street without fear."  Before May 15, a series of citizens groups across Spain used social media networks like Facebook to call for protests on May 15. The large response seemed to surprise even the organizers, as tens of thousands of people turned out in Madrid, Barcelona and other cities.  The crowds have been dominated by young people, but also included retirees and families with young children. Demonstrators had a long and varied list of demands, but an underlying current was a call for change in Spain's political and economic system, to make itaccording to the protestersmore democratic.  The movement gained force, with daily demonstrations involving thousands of people nationwide, in the run-up to May 22 municipal and regional elections. The conservative Popular Party was the big winner in that vote and now is poised, many analysts say, to win national parliamentary elections over the ruling Socialists. Those elections are expected no later than next March.  But the protesters have said repeatedly that neither of the two main parties represents their interests. Several protesters told CNN they voted for smaller parties which are farther left than the Socialists.  The protests of the May 15 movement have been largely peaceful, with police standing by. But there were scuffles, arrests and minor injuries at various flash points, including in Barcelona last week.

The separatist group behind a series of bombings on a Spanish vacation island marks the 50 year anniversary of its struggle this year, a milestone that sees it no closer to achieving its goal.  Police cordon off the route leading to the location of the latest blasts in Palma de Mallorca.  ETA, which is fighting for the independence of Spain's northern Basque region, was said to be behind three bombs that detonated on the island of Mallorca on Sunday without hurting anyone.  The latest incident appears to be part of a new wave of attacks, including another in Mallorca which killed two Civil Guard officers in July, which have left a 2006 cease-fire a distant memory.  The violent resurgence also defies Spanish government claims that the group's operational capabilities have been broken by a series of high profile arrests in Spain and France.  ETA, blamed for more than 800 deaths and listed as a terrorist group by Spain the European Union and the United States, began campaigning for Basque independence in 1959.  The group, whose full name Euskadi Ta Askatasuna means "Basque Homeland and Freedom" in the Basque language, killed what some say was its first victim in 1968.  Since then it waged a campaign of violence against the Spanish state, targeting politicians, policemen, judges and soldiers, often clocking up numerous civilian casualties with deadly car bombs.  In 1980 alone ETA was blamed for 118 deaths, and in 1995 it nearly succeeded in assassinating Jose Maria Aznar, then leader of the opposition and later Spain's prime minister.  On September 16, 1998, the organization declared a "unilateral and indefinite" cease-fire, raising hopes that its campaign was at an end. ETA called off the cease-fire in November 1999, however, and 2000 saw a sharp escalation in violence.  Another unilateral cease-fire was declared in March 2005, with ETA raising hopes for a lasting peace by declaring it "permanent." It was called off by ETA in June 2006 following numerous more ETA attacks.  At the center of the struggle is a region know as Euskal Herria in Basque. The area straddles the western end of the Pyrenees, covering 20,664 square kilometers in northern Spain and southern France. See map of territory claimed by Basque separatists  Spain officially recognizes three Basque provinces, Alava, Guipuzcoa and Vizcaya. A fourth neighboring province, Navarra, is of Basque heritage. Separatists consider these four provinces plus three in FranceBasse Navarre, Labourd and Souleas the Basque country, with a population approaching 3 million.  The area has always possessed a fiercely independent instinct. The Basque people are the oldest indigenous ethnic group in Europe and have lived uninterrupted in the same region since the beginning of recorded history.  Their language, Euskera, which is spoken regularly by about 40 percent of Basque inhabitants, bears no relation to any other Indo-European tongue and dates back to before the Romans arrived in Spain.  For many centuries the Basques of Spain enjoyed a strong degree of autonomy.  The Basque region's hilly landscape helped keep its people isolated from outside influences.  In the Spanish Civil War, two Basque provincesGuipuzcoa and Viscayafought against Gen. Francisco Franco, while the provinces of Alava and Navarra fought for Franco. Under Franco's dictatorship (1939-75), most of the Basque region had its remaining autonomy rescinded. Its culture, people and language were suppressed.  ETA and its demands for an independent Basque state arose in 1959 in the midst of this suppression.  ETA has focused its activities on the Spanish side of the border. For many years France provided a safe haven for ETA members, a situation that began to change in the mid-1980s.  The organization has financed its campaign through kidnapping, bank robbery and a so-called "revolutionary tax" on Basque businessesa payment widely regarded as plain extortion.  According to the counter-terrorism office of the U.S. State Department, ETA members received training in Libya, Lebanon and Nicaragua, while the group also enjoyed close links with the Irish Republican Army. The Good Friday peace accord influenced ETA to call its cease-fire in 1998.  
 Hong Kong The death toll from fighting between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in western Myanmar last week has risen to 84 and at least 22,500 people have been displaced by the sectarian violence, state media and the United Nations say.  The state-run New Light of Myanmar newspaper said on Monday that 129 people were also injured during the violence, which erupted on October 21 and has cast a pall over recent reforms in the Asian nation.  However, the paper added that no new clashes had been reported since Sunday and the areas affected had returned to "normalcy."  Following a visit to five townships where the fighting took place, Ashok Nigam, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Myanmar, on Sunday said his team had seen "large-scale" destruction of houses and the displaced were in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.  "I am gravely concerned by the fear and mistrust that I saw in the eyes of the displaced people in both communities," Nigam said in a statement.  "It is critically important that the government ensures that the rule of law prevails."  The fighting also prompted Islamic organizations to cancel the four-day religious holiday of Eid al-Adha, which ends on Monday. The groups gave no explanation for the move, but locals regarded it as a precautionary measure.  The worst fighting, according to the New Light of Myanmar, took place in Kyauktaw, a village in Rakhine state, where 12 people were killed. Security forces used tear gas and other riot control devices to "disperse the mob" and seized 71 firearms.  Q&A: What's behind the sectarian violence in Myanmar?  There has been tension between the Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims since May, when violence began in Rakhine state after three Muslim men were arrested on suspicion of raping and killing a Buddhist woman.  Nigam said that, according to government estimates, 4,600 houses had been set ablaze across eight townships in the latest flare-up.  The number of people who have fled their homes could be higher, with the country's government still checking the numbers of displaced people and those that have fled the violence by boat, he added.  The U.N. is already assisting around 75,000 people forced to flee their homes during violence in June earlier this year. Most are living in makeshift camps.  "The violence, fear and mistrust is contrary to the democratic transition and economic and social development that Myanmar is committed to. It should not become an impediment to progress for all people of Myanmar," Nigam said.  Dramatic satellite imagery obtained by Human Rights Watch showed what it said was extensive destruction of buildings in a predominantly Rohingya area of the coastal town of Kyauk Pyu.  The swath of arson, the group said, stretched over 35 acres and included houseboats and floating barges. It added that local police shot at Muslims trying to put out the fires.  Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said the government in Myanmar has done little to address the root causes of the violence and the discriminatory treatment that many Rohingya face.  "Extremists in both communities have been empowered by a lack of accountability where people involved in sectarian violence haven't been bought to justice so it's a very, very bad situation and one that is getting worse," he told CNN.  The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted by the Myanmar military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Myanmar doesn't recognize them as citizens.  Unrest between the Rohingya and majority Buddhists has tested President Thein Sein's administration, which is trying to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance.  The government has sent extra security into the troubled region and declared a state of emergency. The president's office warned Thursday that "manipulators" behind the violence can expect to be found and prosecuted.  Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, speaking in Parliament on Friday, called for a greater security presence and urged authorities to investigate suspected human rights offenses.

Kia Horton was thin as a little girl. "Like fit your fingers around (my) ankles skinny," she recalls.  But at 5, she says, she became a victim of sexual abuse, triggering more than a decade of poor eating habits. By the time she started eighth grade, she was borderline obese.  At 15, Horton weighed almost 200 pounds. Her father allowed her to sign up for a diet meal delivery service. She lost 30 pounds on the program, but she says, "I hated the food, and the program was not sustainable because eating their food was the only key to success."  She gained back the 30 pounds and then some. By the time she graduated college, she weighed 260 pounds.  "I immediately joined a gym and hired a personal trainer," Horton says. "This also proved to be futile because I was not ready to change my eating habits."  She lost no weight working out with the trainer. "I quit!" she remembers thinking.  Her bad eating habits continued, and in 2006, at 31, the Chicagoan topped out at her heaviest weight of 319 pounds. Horton is 5 feet 4 inches; her body mass index at the time was 54.8, which is considered morbidly obese.  "Every night for dinner I would stop and get two Happy Meals from McDonald's," she says.  She didn't have kids at the time, but Horton acted like she was ordering the meals for her children. She didn't want anyone to realize she was eating both kids' meals by herself.  Everything felt out of control, Horton says. She didn't have a great relationship with her mother, she didn't feel valued at her job, and some of her personal relationships were in disarray. For weeks at a time, she wouldn't interact with family or friends outside of her co-workers. She continued to allow food to be her comfort.  "Food was the only thing that was good," she remembers. "It didn't talk back."  She knew starting a weight loss journey would be useless if she didn't address the issues that led her to gain the weight in the first place.  "There was so much going on in every aspect of my life," says Horton, now 38. "I would have lasted on a diet for a week."  Making progress  At her heaviest weight, in 2007, Horton got engaged. She knew she wanted to look amazing in her wedding gown. But she often wondered, "How can I possibly look good in a wedding dress at 300 pounds?"  Horton had begun attending therapy sessions in her early 30s to work through the early childhood abuse and other personal issues. Now she felt she was ready to consider weight-loss surgery.  Horton had the Lap-Band procedure done in March 2006. Doctors placed an adjustable band around her stomach, restricting its capacity, which limited the amount of food she could consume. She was supposed to have the band tightened every three months to continue losing weight. But shortly after the procedure, Horton became pregnant with her first child.  She was ecstatic. But after learning of her pregnancy, doctors told her they wouldn't be able to adjust the band during her pregnancy or if she breast-fed. Horton had lost 50 pounds by the time her daughter, Asha, was born in February 2007, but she hasn't had the band adjusted since.  She married a few months later and became pregnant again.  But five months into her pregnancy, she lost the baby. Stress from the miscarriage and other personal problems caused Horton and her husband, Otto, to split shortly after saying their vows. All of a sudden, she was a single mom.  She began eating again to deal with her pain.  Two years later, Horton and Otto reconciled. He moved back home, and they had a son in 2010. By then, she was back up to 300 pounds.  'You have such a pretty face'  Out with her girlfriends for dinner in January 2012, Horton began chatting with a stranger who was extremely fit and a bit of a health buff.  "You have such a pretty face," he said. "Have you ever thought about losing weight?"  Usually, Horton would have been offended by such a question. But she realized he didn't know about her past weight-loss struggles and began to mull over the question he'd posed.  The next week, Horton put a call out to her Facebook friends, saying she wanted a friend to join Weight Watchers with her. She began the program on January 17, 2012, and she hasn't looked back.  The first week, Horton lost four pounds. "I almost jumped off the scale!" she says. "I couldn't believe it." It was just the push she needed to continue. By March 6, she was down 25 pounds.  Lifestyle changes and support  Horton follows the guidelines of the Weight Watchers plan by counting points and taking accountability for everything she puts in her body. She has oatmeal almost every morning for breakfast. For dinner, she sticks to protein and plenty of vegetables.  But at lunch, she says, she eats out every single day. Her strategy? "I literally check out every item on the food menus in my local area, and I make conscious choices and good decisions on what I am putting in my body."  She also incorporated exercise into her routine. "I have never been very patient, so I knew in order to stick with this I was going to need to see results fast."  She began to do Zumba with her husband and kids on their Wii game console. She started walking the trail around her neighborhood, then running. By July 2012, with her new active lifestyle, she was down to 225 pounds.  Today, Horton has reached her goal weight of 142 pounds and, to be honest, she doesn't know what's next. She's thinking of dealing with some of the excess skin that she has from the weight loss, but other than that, she says she's comfortable with her weight and body. She's lost a total of 177 pounds from her highest weight and says she feels like "a totally different person."  Horton credits her husband with some of her success, saying he's been supportive since Day One of her weight-loss journey. She appreciates that he's never tried to change her eating habits or derail her plan, even though the couple find it costs more to eat healthy.  "I eat about a pound or two pounds of grapes per day. It's an expensive habit," she says, laughing. "He hasn't divorced me for driving us to financial ruin because of my grape habit."  She'll also soon start work as a part-time receptionist for the Weight Watchers in her neighborhood. She says she's excited to help others and considers herself the first line of offense: The receptionist is the person a potential Weight Watcher speaks to about their trials and triumphs when they check in. Plus, it will help her stay accountable because anyone who works for Weight Watchers must stay at their goal weight.  "The best advice I can give to people is to face their whole life down," she says. Horton says she believes weight gain is a symptom of other issues. "You can't take control over just one aspect of your life; you have to take control over everything. Once you do that, then your journey can begin."  Do you have a weight-loss success story?

 Former "Gunsmoke" actor James Arness, who played Marshal Matt Dillon in the western TV series for 20 years, died Friday from natural causes, according to his website. He was 88.  Over the two decades of "Gunsmoke" episodes from 1955 to 1975, Arness worked with hundreds of actors, some of them just up-and-comers such as Harrison Ford, Burt Reynolds and Charles Bronson. He also worked with Bette Davis.  Arness left behind a letter to his fans, which was posted on his website after his death:  "I had a wonderful life and was blessed with some many loving people and great friends. The best part of my life was my family, especially my wife, Janet. Many of you met her at Dodge City so you understand what a special person she is," Arness wrote.  "I wanted to take this time to thank all of you for the many years of being a fan of 'Gunsmoke,' 'The Thing,' 'How the West Was Won' and all the other fun projects I was lucky enough to have been allowed to be a part of. I had the privilege of working with so many great actors over the years.  EW: Why Arness was greatest TV Western lawman  "I was honored to have served in the army for my country. I was at Anzio during WWII and it makes you realize how very precious life is," Arness wrote.  "Thank you again for all the many letters, cards, emails and gifts we received from you over the years. You are and always have been truly appreciated," he concluded.  Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 26, 1923, Arness later served in the Army and was sent in 1944 to Anzio, the Italian beach that the Army said was the setting for the largest and most violent armed conflict in the history of mankind.  Arness was wounded in his right leg and received the Purple Heart.  According to an Army website, during the four months of the Anzio Campaign, the Allied VI Corps experienced more than over 29,200 combat casualties (4,400 killed, 18,000 wounded, and 6,800 prisoners or missing) and 37,000 noncombat casualties. German combat losses were estimated at 27,500 (5,500 killed, 17,500 wounded, and 4,500 prisoners or missing), according to the Army.  Arness' acting debut was in a movie called "The Farmer's Daughter" opposite Loretta Young.  He worked for John Wayne's film production company Batjac and made movies with Wayne including "Islands in the Sky," "Hondo," "The Sea Chase" and "Big Jim McLain."  Arness also acted in the 1951 sci-fi classic "The Thing," and his 6-foot-7 height made the creature more believable, according to his website.  After "Gunsmoke," Arness continued acting in television in the mini-series "How the West Was Won" in 1978-79 and "McLain's Law" in 1981-82.  In addition to his wife, Arness is survived by two sons and six grandchildren. The services will be private.

Senegal's reward for qualifying for their first Olympic men's football competition is an opening match against hosts Britain, who could include former England captain David Beckham in their team.  Senegal beat Oman in a playoff in Coventry on Monday to claim the last place in the 16-team draw for the Olympic competition, which begins July 26.  In the draw completed Tuesday at Wembley, Senegal and Great Britain were drawn in Group A alongside Uruguay and the United Arab Emirates.  Brazil, who are seeking their first men's football gold, were put in Group C with Egypt, Belarus and New Zealand. Defending champions Argentina failed to qualify.  In the women's competition, Brazil and Britain were drawn together. Defending champions United States are in Group G with France, Colombia and North Korea.  The games will take place at stadiums across Britain, with the finals to be held at Wembley.  Britain will be competing in an Olympic football tournament for the first time since 1960. The national associations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland still oppose the plan because they fear it will threaten their independence.  "They're in a very tough group," world football expert James Montague told CNN World Sport. "All of these teams look at the Olympic tournament in a very different way to the way the British do.  "There's been a lot of controversy over the British team, a lot of opposition to it. There isn't enough unity for the British team to thrive. A team like the UAE have had 10 qualifying games already and they've actually built a team. The Great Britain team only have a long list of 80 playersthey haven't played any games at all."  The 36-year-old Beckham has made no secret of his ambition to play a part in the British squad as one of the three permitted overage players in what is otherwise an Under-23 tournament.  British coach Stuart Pearce said he will only select the midfielder if his form is good enoughand not as recognition of Beckham's ambassadorial role.  Pearce plans to visit the United States to watch Beckham play for LA Galaxy in the MLS.  "He's been a great ambassador but that's no guarantee he'll get in the squad," Pearce said. "I'm picking on form and merit alone."  Britain will kick off the tournament against Senegal at Old Trafford on July 26 before playing the UAE at Wembley three days later and Uruguay in Cardiff on 1 August.  Brazil are expected to include 20-year-old Santos star Neymar in their squad. They will play in Cardiff, Manchester and Newcastle.  The Brazilian women's team could include five-time world player of their year Marta as they look to win gold for the first time, having lost the final to the U.S. in 2004 and 2008.  "The big game I'm looking forward to is the holders United States against North Korea," Montague said. "North Korea have a fantastic women's side who have done very well in previous World Cups and Olympics. That's going to be the crunch game.  "Great Britain against Brazil will also be fantasticespecially if the Brazilians take Marta along as well."  DRAWS  Men's: Group A: Great Britain, Senegal, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay Group B: Mexico, South Korea, Gabon, Switzerland Group C: Brazil, Egypt, Belarus, New Zealand Group D: Spain, Japan, Honduras, Morocco (Top two teams from each group advance to quarterfinals)  Women's: Group E: Great Britain, New Zealand, Cameroon, Brazil Group F: Japan, Canada, Sweden, South Africa Group G: USA, France, Colombia, North Korea (Top two teams from each group and the two best third-placed teams advance to quarterfinals)  
 "Go back to sleep."  Groggy from a night of drinking, that's precisely what James Landrith did.  The next morning, Landrithwho was 19 at the timewoke up in a bed that he quickly realized was not his own. As his haze lifted, he recognized the woman who ordered him to sleep the night before as a friend of a friend.  He remembered she asked for a ride home after their mutual friend left the nightclub where they'd been partying. He remembered the woman was pregnant and bought him drinks as a thank you.  He remembered feeling disoriented, and her suggesting a motel room to sleep it off. He even remembered lying down with his pants on, uncomfortable taking them off in front of a stranger, only to awaken later and find the woman straddling him. What he didn't remember was saying "yes."  The morning after, that familiar voice told him that he could hurt the baby if he put up a fight. Then, he says, she forced herself on him again. A few minutes later it was over. One night in a motel twin bed turned into years of self-examination.  It took some time, and the help of a therapist, to get there: "I was finally able to call it what it was," he says.  Landrith had been raped.  That was 1990. Since then, Landritha former Marine based at Camp Lejeunehas spoken out on behalf of sexual assault victims, in particular men who were victimized by women. He didn't seek prosecution of his alleged rapist, but he wants other victims to feel free to talk about sexual assault and pursue justice without shame.  "I want people to understand that it's not about how physically strong you are," he says. "We [men] are conditioned to believe that we cannot be victimized in such a way."  According to a 2010 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men in the United States have been raped. The actual number is likely higher, experts say, as incidents of sexual violence are severely underreported in the United Statesparticularly among male victims.  Experts say any sexual assault victim requires extensive emotional and psychological healing after the incident, but male survivors have a harder time putting words to what happened.  In 2012, the FBI's Uniform Crime Report made a significant stride by redefining rape as: "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim."  The prior definition"the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will"hadn't been changed since 1927, and sexual assault awareness groups say it alienated victims that didn't fit the mold.  Veteran confronts rape, suicide: 'I am angry that others are going through this'  "Often, male survivors may be less likely to identify what happened to them as abuse or assault because of the general notion that men always want sex," says Jennifer Marsh, the vice president for Victim Services at RAINN, an anti-sexual violence organization.  "Males have the added burden of facing a society that doesn't believe rape can happen to them ... at all," says psychotherapist Elizabeth Donovan.  She says gender roles dictate that males are expected to be strong and self-reliantmen are viewed as those who seek sexual conquests instead of those who "fend them off."  The concept of female-on-male sexual assault has recently gained traction on the Web via the ever-provocative entertainer Chris Brown. Brown recently revealed shocking details to Decca Aitkenhead in the Guardian about his first sexual encounter.  "He lost his virginity when he was 8 years old, to a local girl who was 14 or 15. Seriously? 'Yeah, really. Uh-huh.' He grins and chuckles. 'It's different in the country.' "  Tom Hawking of FlavorWire is one of many writers who took umbrage with this particular anecdote, asking in an article, "Why Is No One Talking About the Fact That Chris Brown Was Raped?"  Trauma recovery counselor Stephanie Baird says men who experience sexual attention as children, as Brown did, often explain it to themselves as "I'm a stud, I got laid by ..."  "They do this in order to feel as if they had some power and say," she says.  In addition to this macho posturing, there's also the hot-for-teacher or -babysitter complex that is a popular motif in modern American culture.  U.N. study in Asia delves into why men rape  "Because of the culture of 'Mrs. Robinson' it can be much more difficult for a male to even recognize that the action is abusive or without consent," Baird says.  Consent, she says, means "being of age, mind, sound body to make an informed decision about whether one would like to become sexually intimate with the other person." Children cannot consent.  The chatter over Brown comes in tandem with recent research published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics that says nearly 1 in 10 youths between 14 and 21 years old have reported perpetrating some type of sexual violence in their lifetime.  The study also found that males and females carried out sexual violence at strikingly similar rates after the age of 1852% of males and 48% of females. The study classified sexual violence into a few categories: foresexual or presexual contact (kissing, touching, etc. against their will), coercive sex, attempted rape, and completed rape. Women were more likely to  instigate unwanted foresexual contact.  For male sexual assault victims of any age, convincing others that they've been preyed upon is difficult as well. Experts say the general disparity in physical strength comes into playcan't a man fight off a woman?  "It's a tough call; people think men can't be raped and they don't understand that in the confusion no still means no," says Curtis St. John, a representative for MaleSurvivor, a national support group for male sexual victimization.  Further muddying the water is the fact that some men can perform sexually, even including orgasm, and still be raped.  In an article in the Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine, Roy J. Levin and Willy Van Berlo found that even in men who have not consented to sex, slight stimulation of the genitals or an increase in stress can create erections "even though no specic sexual stimulation is present."  " 'Were you aroused?' " is a question posed to male victims, St. John says. "You don't hear it with female rape victims. It's an interesting question that men get asked."  Long-term effects of being sexually assaulted can include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse, avoidance of intimacy or the stark oppositehyper-sexuality, says St. John.  "Some men feel a need to prove their masculinity by becoming hyper-masculine," Donovan says.  As for coping, Marsh at RAINN says it's never too late to reach out for help. But with the stigma attached, survivors may not feel comfortable talking to their friends and family because the victims themselves haven't defined their experience as assault.  For Landrith, it starts with confronting rape for what it is and sharing experiences.  "Whenever you talk about male survivors, women have it statistically worse, but it's not a competitionand we each need our time to talk about it," he says.

Two people, one of them a licensed greyhound trainer, have been arrested in Australia after at least 55 dog carcasses were found dumped in Queensland bush, according to Australian media reports.  Two Bundaberg residents, a 71-year old man and a 64-year old woman, were each charged with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm, broadcaster ABC reported.  The woman, a licensed trainer, was also charged with obstructing police.  Michael Beatty, spokesman for RSPCA Queensland, told ABC that inquiries were continuing. The animal rights organization is assisting Queensland police in their investigation.  "A lot of people in the area who were involved in the greyhound industry were questioned, and it was as a result of information given to us that the joint Queensland Police Service and RSPCA investigation team made those arrests," he said.  At a press conference Thursday, Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller described the discovery of the carcasses, which followed a tip-off from a member of the public, as sickening.  "What I believe has happened here has been the mass murder of 55 greyhounds outside of Bundaberg," she said.  She promised a zero tolerance approach to animal abuse.  "The people who have perpetrated this crime, to me, are oxygen thieves, they are cowards and they are pathetic."  Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth said the crime scene was "nothing short of abhorrent."  "Some of the greyhounds were in different states of decay and that would sort of indicate to us that they've been dumped there over varying periods of time," he said.  "The postmortem will reveal the cause of death of these dogs. However I will comment that a number of spent .22 cartridge shells were found in the vicinity."  He said there had been a number of bushfires in the area surrounding the dumping site, which would also be factored into the investigation.  Beatty said it appeared the dogs would have been culled by people involved in greyhound racing.  "There's always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry," he said in a statement.  "The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know."  Australia's greyhound racing industry has been under intense scrutiny since a television investigation revealing the illegal use of live bait in training dogs aired in February.  The investigation, on the ABC network, showed footage of trainers fixing live possums, piglets and rabbits to lures to be chased and mauled to death by dogs, prompting a wave of bans and suspensions from the sport.  Australians wager AU$4 billion ($3.03 billion) a year on greyhound racing, according to the ABC report.  Ainsworth said the Queensland police had established a joint taskforce with the RSPCA to investigate the industry in the wake of the report.  "We've not even tipped the iceberg as yet," he said, appealing for those involved in the industry to come forward.  "You know who you are, you know what you've been involved in, and now is the time to stand up and be counted," he said.  "It will only be a matter of time before we get around to knocking on everyone's door."  Racing Queensland did not respond to a request for comment.  CNN's Chieu Luu contributed to this report.  
 Gainesville, Georgia Kelsey Trusty plans almost everything, but getting cancer was one thing she didn't anticipate.  Yet what began as an unexpected health crisis has led to an untapped source of creativity that helps her pay for treatment.  In October 2011, the 22-year-old nursing student from Gainesville, Georgia, was in the middle of her first year of nursing school, a job at a hospital and organizing her wedding when she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.  In the blink of an eye, Trusty made the transition from physician-in-training to patient. She began a month-long hospital stay to receive chemotherapy and blood transfusions.  "I was in the hospital with quite a bit of time on my hands," Trusty said. "I'm not the kind of person who can just sit and watch TV all day. I needed something to do to keep me sane."  Inspired by a post her mother saw on Pinterest, Trusty began braiding scarves out of old T-shirts. After perfecting her method, she shared her work on Facebook, thinking maybe a few people would want one.  Much to her surprise, demand was instant. After her diagnosis, she had to quit school because her treatment included extended hospital stays. But soon enough, she found she had nearly a full-time job filling scarf orders.  The scarves come in a variety of styles and sizes, and customers can choose the colors. Trusty makes the scarves by cutting strips of T-shirt material and braiding them together. Sometimes, her hands tremble from chemotherapy as she adds a hand-stitched logo featuring the leukemia awareness ribbon.  "It went from zero to 60 very quickly," she said. "I think it really appealed to people being able to customize them."  Trusty set about branding her product, naming her budding business "Tussle" in a nod to her battle with leukemia. Her best friend created a logo and she set up a Facebook page for the business. She even has her own shipping labels, "And that made me feel really fancy," she said.  Profits from the scarves have had a tremendous impact on her out-of-pocket medical expenses, she said, covering co-payments for doctor's visits and subsidizing the cost of cancer treatment. Meanwhile, she's still getting ready for her wedding in July.  "No one ever expects to be paying for a wedding and chemotherapy at the same time," she said. "It's an incredible burden lifted off my shoulders and my family's shoulders."  In addition to the positive financial impact, Trusty is also using her creativity to help other cancer patients. Last month, Trusty auctioned off one of her scarves, donating the proceeds to another cancer patient.  "It's nice to be able to use something that's helped me to help other people as well," Trusty said. "I'm a people-pleaser by nature, so it helps me stay positive when I see other people happy as well."  She has shipped scarves all over the country and as far away as England. One of the best things about the experience has been meeting new people in her community and beyond and sharing stories with them, she said.  "I make scarves mainly for people who I've never met before," she said. "And so it's been a really cool way for me to meet people in my community and get to know people who I probably never would have gotten the chance to meet before."  She is unsure of what her future holds after treatment, but the experience has given her an appreciation for the unpredictability of life and the value of every day.  "Right now, I don't know what the plan is for me, and that's scary," she said. "But my God tells me, and my experience tells me, that I don't need to worry about planning the next step."  
	 'A Georgia nursing student has been able to make a full-time living by braiding'
There's something about growing up in a small town.  Don't get me wrong, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago are all great cities with their own identity and appeal, but if you spent your formative years in a burg where traffic lights were few and far between; where watching freight trains was a welcome distraction; where after school, kids waste time at the nearest lake, river or abandoned quarry, then count yourself as lucky.  This kind of small-town adolescence is uniquely American, and it's a lifestyle that's rapidly vanishing.  Brian Kimberling perfectly captures this experience in his debut novel, "Snapper," available Tuesday. Kimberling grew up in Evansville, Indiana, and the book makes the most of its Hoosier setting.  In it, narrator Nate Lochmueller is an affable young ornithologist, earning just enough money to live on by studying the songbirds of Indiana. Not coincidentally, Kimberling also worked as a bird researcher when he was a student at Indiana University.  "Snapper" follows Nate through a series of mostly aimless adventures as he travels across the state in a glitter-festooned truck dubbed the Gypsy Moth.  Nate spends a good part of the book in the wilds of Indiana, where he beautifully describes tracking and observing birds like the Summer tanager and wood thrushes, as well as warblers, chickadees and Acadian flycatchers. There are also some hilarious anecdotes involving a dive-bombing bald eagle, a German shepherd with a knack for digging up human bones and a snapping turtle with a taste for thumbs, hence the title.  But this is more than a bird book. There are plenty of poignant moments as Nate tries to figure out his place in the world's pecking order.  There's his on-again, off-again love affair with a free-spirited beauty named Lola and a colorful cast of characters including Nate's parents, an aunt and uncle from Texas with some questionable views on race, a small group of childhood friends and a few shiftless roommates.  Kimberling writes about all of this in a voice part John Audubon, part Holden Caulfield but uniquely his own. The book's pace is leisurely, the mood is sometimes melancholy, and readers will finish the final page feeling thoroughly satisfied.  Perhaps surprising to readers, Kimberling no longer lives in Indiana. After wandering the globe, he now makes his home in England with his wife and son. CNN recently spoke to him about the novel and whether he misses the U.S. The following is an edited transcript.  CNN: What was the spark behind "Snapper"?  Brian Kimberling: Some friends and I used to build fires on Indiana train tracks at night and sit around with a bottle of something purloined from someone's parents. I told this to an English friend who knew nothing about Indiana and who began imagining and describing a romantically desolate sort of place, forsaken by commerce and industrythat's how we knew no trains would come througha place where there were no girls to talk to and no drugs worth taking, so adolescent boys played hobo together or whatever it was we thought we were doing. That is a very English way of viewing Indiana. It is also absolutely right, or it used to be. That conversation was a spark. I ran with it.  CNN: Had you always wanted to be a writer?  Kimberling: I don't know when I began writing. I won a national award in high school for a short story about a character named Maudlin Lackey who commits suicide. I have since learned some restraint. I had been writing regularly for a couple of years already at the time. It's always been important to me, though, to do other things besides writeto be something other than or in addition to a writer. So I've worked as a Web developer and an English teacher and an editor and a frozen pizza stacker and so on, in the Czech Republic and Mexico and Turkey and England.  CNN: Where did the title come from?  Kimberling: My editor and I did kick around alternative titles for a while. The problem was that other titles (such as "Audubon, Indiana") seemed to restrict the book's scope somehow and that the snapping turtle in the book has symbolic value. In the end, it was a case of, well, it can't be called anything else, can it? "Snapper" is a digressive, meandering book that invites readers to make connections and interpret things as they will. A more descriptive title (say, "Birding in Indiana") wouldn't do that justice. Also, "Snapper" is a snappy title.  CNN: You write with great admiration about Indiana's songbirds. Do you have a particular favorite from your days as an amateur ornithologist?  Kimberling: I like the wood thrush, as does the narrator, Nathan, and as did Audubon and Thoreau, both. It's probably not humanly possible to listen to the wood thrush attentively without some emotional response. Whereas the Acadian flycatcher is pretty boring. I think "birdsong" and "songbird" are both misleading words. Lots of songbirds just chirp. I was a research assistant for a major study of songbirds for two years, starting at 5 a.m. six days a week. I especially enjoyed running into non-birds. Foxes, raccoons, opossums, all finishing up the night shift at around the time I started. Their collective expression was: "Hey, you're human. Either shoot us or leave us alone. Stop coming around every day."  CNN: You seem to have a love/hate relationship with Indiana, is that correct? Has your feeling for your home state changed since you've lived abroad?  Kimberling: I love it from a great distance. There are many things in Indiana that I appreciate more for having lived abroad. Turoni's Pizza in Evansville tops the list. Bloomington and Brown County are outstanding, and the Ohio is the most beautiful river in the world, as Thomas Jefferson observed 200-odd years ago. Not sure what the beautiful-river criteria are, but it's true. I think a lot, in a possibly European-inflected way, about the cultural heritage of southern Indiana (five words that do not often appear in that sequence). It's not all pretty, but it's all important.  CNN: What's it like now, having moved to England, and would you ever return to the Hoosier State?  Kimberling: I would certainly return to the Hoosier State. I spent three months there last summer with my wife and son, in fact, and all of us enjoyed it immensely. That said, after 10 years in England, there were a few things I found a wee bit alarming. Health care costs and the size of the average pickup truck, for example. The idea that random civilians may carry guns or, for that matter, that the police do carry guns. I suppose I experience a mild form of culture shock.  CNN: What's next for you?  Kimberling: I am working on another novel also set in southern Indiana.  Read an excerpt from "Snapper" here  
 Kenroy Williams, also known as "Booms," is "Guardian of the Reptiles" in Hellshire, located near the Goat Islands in Jamaica. The region is centered in the Portland Bight Protected Area, an area of ocean and land set apart in 1999 to protect its rich biodiversity of birds, reptiles, plants, trees and marine life.  But now, the Jamaican government is preparing to sell the Goat Islands to the China Harbour Engineering Co. to build a megafreighter seaport and industrial park. China Harbour is part of a conglomerate blacklisted by the World Bank under its Fraud and Corruption Sanctioning Policy.  "They're destroying what should be preserved," says Booms, who has been working to protect exceedingly rare reptiles in the area for seven years, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana.  The specifics of the development are being withheld, but Jamaica Information Service reports  it involves dredging and land reclamation, and a coal-fired power plant built to service the facilities. Environmentalists expect the mangrove forest on the two Goat Islands to be clear cut and the surrounding coral reef dredged.  With the threat to Goat Islands looming, Robin Moore, a fellow with the International League of Conservation Photographers, flew to Jamaica to record images of wildlife and people who may soon see the destruction of their beaches, mangrove forest ecosystems and their livelihoods.  In a short film by Moore, Booms talks about what's at stake: "Portland Bight Protected Area consists of a beautiful beach and things that are here in Jamaica and found nowhere else, like the iguanas ...  "When the mangroves are destroyed, the earth won't stay together and then the water will take over. And that's the problem. And we won't have any beaches, and we can't do without beaches. If we have no beaches, we have no turtles. We won't have any crocodiles ..."  Booms especially fears for the Jamaican iguanas, Cyclura collei, thought to be extinct until 1990, when Edwin Duffus found one while hunting pigs in the Hellshire Hills. The Goat Islands are right off the Hellshire coast. At the time, surveys of the area revealed fewer than 100 iguanas remaining.  Hope Zoo and Botanical Gardens in Kingston, teamed with the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas and others, set up a program to rear baby iguanas until they're big enough to be safe from predators. After release, the iguanas are tracked and observed to see how well they fare.  The number of nesting females has grown from just six in 1991 to more than 30 in 2013. About 255 head-started iguanas have been released into Hellshire, the only place on earthother than the Goat Islandsthat they can survive. The Jamaica Iguana Recovery Project believes the islands are the sanctuary necessary to save the animal.  During the past 24 years, millions of dollars, plus the sweat of countless biologists and research volunteers, have been invested in bringing Cyclura collei back from the brink. Although many released iguanas are breeding and nesting in the wild, the animal is still critically endangered.  Jamaican iguanas can live for 40 years or more. They distinguish between strangers and researchers who come to the forest regularly and may show themselves once they feel safe.  Imagine a 4-foot long, 15-pound dinosaur-like animal walking out of the bush, sitting down nearby, and making eye contact with you.  "There is indeed something special about making eye contact with a Cyclura," herpetologist Rick Hudson, of the Fort Worth Zoo, said. "Back in the 1990s, you rarely saw an iguana; you might hear one crashing through the bush but glimpses were a special sight. Now, you go out in Hellshire and see big healthy iguanas that are habituated and come and hang out with you. It's the most incredible story I have ever been a part of."  The Jamaican Constitution states that the nation's citizens have "the right to enjoy a healthy and productive environment free from the threat of injury or damage from environmental abuse and degradation of the ecological heritage."  Some argue the project will bring jobs, but as fisherwoman Paulette Coley told Moore: "The government claims it will bring jobs and opportunity to the area, but we are not qualified, and we are not being trained for the jobs that will need to be done. They tell us what they want us to hear, but the reality is that we will be worse off."  Diana McCaulay, CEO of the Jamaica Environment Trust, says that in past projects with Chinese contractors, most of the employees have been Chinese. "What is the benefit to Jamaica? That's not clear."  McCaulay says developing Goat Islands extends the global crisis of unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. "Jamaica is a small island," she says, "but this is happening all over the world, relentless pressure for high impact development that doesn't benefit local populations, particularly those who use the resources.  "Although global climate change is a clear danger to island nations, we are still building on the coast and taking out natural protections like mangroves. Our regulatory agencies simply cannot cope, especially with players like China who have huge financial resources and care little about the environment."  The rediscovery of the Jamaican iguana and the success of the recovery program has generated a huge conservation movement that draws international funding and ecotourism to the West Indies.  This ecotourism could be developed. In 2012, tourism contributed close to $4 billion to the economy of Jamaica and 25% of jobs in the country are tourism-based.  Tourists travel to see unspoiled beaches and native flora and fauna, and ideally, to see people living in a healthy relationship with their land. But if the Jamaican government sells out to Chinese developers, reversing its environmental protection laws and going against its own constitution, it will send the message that investing in tourism in Jamaica is unwise.  There is still time to help the Jamaican people save their national treasure. Both Jamaica and China care about international opinion. Letters expressing concern and signatures on a petition may persuade Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller to stop the proposed development.  Of his work as guardian of the reptiles ,Booms says, "My family and friends? Some of them think it's awesome. ... Some of them ask me if I really touch the lizards and some think I'm crazy when they hear about the crocodiles. But the truth of the matter is that they don't understand, and I know that. 'Cause if they were here like me, they would understand. We are at one with nature."

Atlanta Open a car door on a summer day, and a sauna blast will quickly remind you just how seethingly, sticky hot it can get inside in just a short time. It's suffocating.  For 22-month-old Cooper Harris, strapped all day into a child's seat in his father's SUV, as the sun baked it, it was fatal.  Investigators in Georgia wanted to know how high the temperature climbed in that back seat, so this week they recreated that sauna heat in Justin Ross Harris' silver Hyundai Tucson.  They drove it to the spot where it sat in the sun for seven hours on June 18, the day Cooper died.  They have not released the data yet, but CNN weather experts believe temperatures could have climbed to nearly 140 degrees inside the car.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Authority has corroborated the possibility.  "Even outside temperatures in the 60s can cause a car temperature to rise well above 110 F," the agency said.  The test came in the same week that the Cobb County medical examiner's office said toxicology tests on the boy revealed nothing abnormal, meaning he apparently was not drugged or medicated.  That report and the autopsy reportwhich found the child's cause of death "consistent with hyperthermia" and that investigative information "suggests the manner of death is homicide"will not be released to the public until the investigation is complete, the office said Thursday.  Cooper's father, Justin Ross Harris, is charged with murder and child cruelty. He has pleaded not guilty.  Harris fired by employer  Harris, who worked for two years at the The Home Depot's corporate offices in the Atlanta suburb of Smyrna, has been terminated, a spokeswoman for the company said Thursday.  Harris, a web designer, had been on unpaid leave since charges were filed last month.  Catherine Woodling gave no details of the termination.  A Home Depot charity fund paid for Cooper's funeral.  Measuring temperatures at key times  During this week's car test, investigators parked in the same space that Harris did, WAGA reported, and measured the temperature at times of day that are key to the father's murder case: At 9:30 a.m., when police say Harris pulled into the parking lot at The Home Depot's corporate offices. He normally would have taken Cooper to daycare then, but left him in the car. At 12:42 p.m., when the 33-year-old father placed light bulbs he had purchased inside the car. And at 4:16 p.m., when investigators say Harris drove off.  Should the government step in to prevent hot car deaths?  On the day Cooper died, the high temperature reached 92 degrees. Investigators used outside thermometers on Tuesday to monitor outdoor temperature rises.  Dozens of children die in hot cars every year, the NHTSA said.  People are in danger of dying of heatstroke when their body temperatures climb above 104 degrees and stay there for prolonged periods, according to the Mayo Clinic.  Heat attacks the brain, heart, kidneys and muscles, the Mayo Clinic said.  Victims can experience nausea and faintness, before organ damage sets in, eventually leading to death.  The elderly and small children are particularly susceptible to heatstroke.  Who is Justin Ross Harris?  Death highlights key role of digital evidence  Uncomfortable details  Initially, police said the death of the toddler was the result of tragic absent-mindedness.  They said the dad had apparently forgotten the boy was in the back seat of his Hyundai Tucson and apparently didn't remember until he was done with his workday, drove a couple of miles and pulled into a shopping center parking lot.  But suspicions grew as police investigated, and Harris was charged.  Investigators also have unearthed uncomfortable details in Harris' online activities. He has performed Internet searches on child death in hot cars, they said.  While Cooper was left in the car, Harris was allegedly chatting via an online contact service with women. Police say that Harris, who is married, has, in the past, sent sexually explicit messages and photos on the service, including to an underage girl.  Leanna Harris, Justin's wife, has not been named a suspect in the case. Officer Michael Bowman, a Cobb County police spokesman, said Monday, "Leanna Harris has been interviewed. Detectives continue to work on the case."  Opinion: In hot car death, leave the mom alone  Police have alleged she behaved strangely in the days before and moments after the death of her 22-month-old boy.  Thursday, defense attorney Lawrence Zimmerman confirmed to CNN he had been retained by Leanna Harris.  5 questions about mother in toddler's hot-car death  Read the warrant (PDF)  CNN"s Devon Sayers and John Murgatroyd contributed to this report.  
 Mexico City The runner-up in Mexico's presidential election said Friday he still won't accept a vote count, even after the country's electoral tribunal upheld the legality of the election and officially declared Enrique Pena Nieto as the winner.  Leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has not conceded the July 1 election, citing allegations of electoral fraud by the victorious Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.  The electoral tribunal on Thursday rejected a demand by Lopez Obrador's coalition, the Progressive Movement of Mexico, to invalidate the presidential election, which he lost by 6 percentage points. On Friday, it validated the final results, officially naming Pena Nieto as president-elect.  "The elections were not clean or free or authentic. As such, I will not recognize the illegitimate power that came from vote-buying and other grave violations of the constitution and the laws," Lopez Obrador said.  The candidate called on his followers to demonstrate in Mexico City's historical square, the Zocalo, on September 9.  Lopez Obrador narrowly lost another presidential race in 2006. Back then, he refused to recognize the new government and called his supporters into the streets. He went on a national tour, where he drummed up support, calling himself the "legitimate president of Mexico."  It was unclear if he would call for similar demonstrations now.  In a unanimous decision announced Thursday, the electoral tribunal ruled that the demand to invalidate the election was "unfounded."  The tribunal found that the leftist coalition that brought the charges didn't prove any constitutional violations and didn't show that the process wasn't free and fair.  Critics of the process said the irregularities included illegal campaign spending, secretive financing and coercion of voters.  Read more: Vote-buying allegations persist after Mexican election  When the allegations surfaced immediately after the vote, election officials recounted the votes in more than half of the ballot boxes individually.  Among the bigger controversies were allegations that PRI campaigners passed out hundreds of supermarket gift cards in exchange for votes.  The electoral tribunal said that the coalition could prove only that PRI officials gave the cards to supporters, and not to the general public in exchange for votes.  Pena Nieto is expected to be sworn in on December 1.  CNNMexico's Belen Zapata and Tania Montalvo contributed to this report.

Hong Kong China has executed eight people convicted of terrorism, including three for their roles in an attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing local authorities.  Authorities in Xinjiang, an ethnically divided province in China's far west, said that three of those executed "masterminded" a terrorist attack on October 28 when a vehicle drove through security barriers and into a crowd on the square in the capital.  It crashed into a pedestrian bridge and burst into flames, killing five, including three in the vehicle, and wounded 40 others.  The other five had been found guilty of crimes including murder of government officials, setting up a terrorist organization and the illegal manufacturing of explosives, Xinhua said.  China has cracked down on violence in Xinjiang involving Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group after a series of high profile attacks in the past year.  Religious extremists  Twenty-nine people were killed and 130 injured when men armed with long knives stormed a train station in Kunming, southwest China in March.  The following month, an attack on a train station in Urumqi, the regional capital, left three dead, including the attackers, and an attack on an Urumqi market in May killed at least 39.  China has blamed religious extremists for violence in the region.  Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward China's Han majority in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang.  Uyghurs also say their religious and cultural freedom has been curtailed.  Earlier this month, a town in Xinjiang temporarily banned people from wearing Islamic-style clothing and large beards on buses.  
 Arsenal's stumbling season suffered a new low on Tuesday as the Gunners failed to reach the League Cup semifinals after being knocked out on penalties by fourth tier side Bradford City.  Having made their worst Premier League start since Arsene Wenger took charge in 1996, Arsenal needed a late equalizer to force extra-timeonly to lose a dramatic penalty shoot-out as Bradford reached the last four for the first time in their 109-year history.  Wenger has often fielded weakened sides for League Cup matches but he sent out a strong team at Bradford where the game ended 1-1 after 90 minutes, with extra-time failing to provide further goals.  As they set about creating one of the biggest upsets in the competition's long history, Bradford opened the scoring through Garry Thompson after 16 minutes.  Despite the presence of Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere and Lukas Podolski, the Gunners failed to register a shot on target until the final quarter of a match against a team from the bottom tier of the English football league.  Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen thought he had rescued his side when heading home after 88 minutes, but the Belgian later turned from hero to villain as he missed the decisive kick in the penalty shoot-out to spark wild scenes of celebrations.  "Whenever you go out, it's not a good result for Arsenal," said Wenger. "We lost on penalties to a team who defended well. I cannot fault the effort of my team, we gave absolutely everything for the 120 minutes and you have to give credit to Bradford."  The win meant that Bradford, whose stadium was hosting its largest crowd since 1960, had set a British record of nine consecutive penalty shoot-out wins.  While the financially challenged clubwho were playing in the Premier League eleven years agowill celebrate the vital income that comes from reaching the competition's semifinals, Wenger can expect ever greater scrutiny in a season that goes from bad to worse.  Many Arsenal fans were incensed when captain Robin van Persie was sold in August to traditional rivals Manchester United, with the league leaders now 15 points ahead of a team lying seventh in the Premier League after 16 rounds.  Wenger, who won three league titles between 1998-2004, angered some supporters earlier this year when stating his belief that it was more important for Arsenal to qualify for the lucrative Champions League than to win trophies.  Without a trophy since the FA Cup win in 2005, some Arsenal followers have lost patience as the gap between the club and rivals Manchester United and Manchester City growswith one group of fans recently protesting before the home defeat by Swansea City at the manner in which the club is being run.  In the evening's other League Cup quarterfinal, Aston Villa coach Paul Lambert enjoyed a return to Norwich City, the club he left in June, as the visitors came from behind to win 4-1.  Bradford and Aston Villa will be joined in the semis by Swansea City or Middlesbrough, who play on Wednesday, while the last quarterfinal will be known on 19 December when Leeds United host Chelsea, who are currently in Japan on Fifa Club World Cup duty.  In the Premier League itself, Sunderland eased the pressure on coach Martin O'Neill when beating Reading 3-0 at home to climb out of the relegation zone and up to 15th in the table.  In France, Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic bagged a hat-trick as Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 win at fifth-placed Valenciennes perfectly set up Carlo Ancelotti's side for Sunday's hosting of league leaders Lyon.  The former Barcelona and AC Milan star needed less than an hour to register a treble, and take his tally to an unsurpassed 17 Ligue 1 goals, before Ezequiel Lavezzi also struck as Valenciennes suffered their first home defeat of the season.  The win takes PSG to within two points of Lyon, who can extend their lead before the weekend's top-of-the-table clash at the Parc des Princes when hosting bottom side Nancy on Wednesday.  PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti was under pressure one week ago, with his side having surrendered top spot in the league, but three consecutive wins have given the Italian some breathing space.  After beating Portuguese title-holders Porto 2-1 to win their Champions League group, the big-spending French side have since thrashed both Evian and Valenciennes 4-0.  Elsewhere, AS Roma beat Atalanta 3-0 to reach the quarterfinals of the Coppa Italia.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday reinforced the nation's belief in freedom and its constitutional traditions with a ruling that upheld my challenge to a section of the federal election campaign law that restricted citizens' rights to express their views.  That outcome, I believe, will become part of a successful attack on the numbing political status quo in Washington and encourage activists across the nation who have fresh ideas to improve how our government operates.  I am grass-roots proof that citizens retain some influence andwith determinationcan achieve positive change. I hardly suspected such an outcome in late 2011 when I launched my legal challenge.  My target was the overall limits on an individual's fully disclosed contributions to federal candidates, national political parties and political action committees. I did not challenge the specific contribution limits in each category.  This case is not about limits on the amount of money you may contribute to an individual candidate. It is about your right to contribute that amount to as many candidates as you choose. Allowing individuals to donate to as many candidates as they wish would draw contributions away from PACs and bring money directly to candidates, giving underdog candidates a fair chance in the political arena.  Like most Americans, I had little knowledge of these campaign lawsincluding how the Washington insiders passed them, interpreted them and enforced them. I have spent my adult life as an electrical engineer in the Birmingham, Alabama, area where I grew up and eventually created a small business that has fewer than two dozen employees. I was too busy for politics until five years ago, at age 42, when I joined many other Americans who were disenchanted by what they saw in Washington and decided to take action.  Sally Kohn: With ruling, money talks even louder in politics  The core belief that has driven my political activity and my legal challenge has been my full embrace of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. During my political science course as a freshman at Georgia Tech University, I learned about the Supreme Court's landmark 1976 decision that political activity was entitled to that protection. All the sitting justices joined, at least in part, that Buckley vs. Valeo ruling, which found that free and open debateincluding unlimited campaign expendituresis "integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution."  This week's ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts restated many of those vital national values. Excessive campaign finance restrictions, he wrote, impermissibly inject the government "into the debate over who should govern." He pointedly added, "And those who govern should be the last people to help decide who should govern."  It doesn't take a political scientist to conclude that congressional incumbents have been the chief beneficiaries of these restrictions. Even with the overwhelming public unhappiness with Congress, they typically have re-election rates of roughly 95%.  A key factor is that the current system makes it much more difficult for challengers to raise money. In most cases, they simply lack the incumbents' access to tap into Washington's deep-pocketed special interests.  This status quo, which has been created chiefly by the so-called political reformers, has had the perversebut seemingly intendedeffect of protecting incumbents in both parties, except for infrequent waves of voter disgust. My objective is to assist challengers in raising funds, and to encourage smarter political ideas.  I clearly am not one of those special interests, nor am I one of the billionaires who have become political targets. Friends call me "your neighbor Shaun." With other activists, I believe that we can change our politics and draw it closer to our communities.  Having become part of public life, I have learned that political conflict and rhetoric sometimes can be hard-ball. But I have made a point of fully respecting other players, even if they criticize me.  My support of the First Amendment in this case helps extend those rights to everybody. With the Supreme Court's encouragement, I hope the nation is prepared for a robust and wide-open public debate to address our problems.  
 From the "Twilight" trilogy to the tearjerkers adapted from Nicholas Sparks novels to nearly every film where Matthew McConaughey takes off his shirt, let's face it: Most cinematic love stories are made for women.  So it may seem strange to release the new "Die Hard" installment, "A Good Day to Die Hard," on Valentine's Day. But for our money, it makes perfect sense. Where "The Notebook" is the gold standard for women, the original "Die Hard" is the ultimate romantic movie for men.  Sound crazy? Stick with me.  The 1988 original stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a sarcastic New York cop visiting his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and his two children in California. When he arrives at Holly's office Christmas party, the tension in their relationship is immediately evident. Holly is using her maiden name again and John doesn't even plan to stay with his family while he's in town.  There's no doubt that John loves his wife and wants to rekindle the romance, but he can't seem to admit it. But while John proves incapable of communicating his feelings to his wife verbally, an opportunity arises allowing him to prove his devotion to her.  Review: Willis goes through the motions in 'A Good Day to Die Hard'  Midway through the party, a team of terrorists led by the stylish Hans Gruber (a scene-stealing Alan Rickman) interrupts the event and holds most of the attendees hostage. The quick-thinking John eludes their grasp and eventually begins taking down the bad guys one by one in order to rescue his captured wife.  The story's subtext recognizes the stereotypical, but undeniable fact that many men aren't romantic or open with their emotions. Despite what many rom-coms and dramas suggest, a lot of guys don't picture themselves courting a woman by blasting a boombox outside a bedroom window, as is done in "Say Anything." (In fact, that's probably illegal in most states.) And forget "Titanic." Guys don't want to get the girl of their dreams by freezing in the ocean while keeping the one they love afloat on a piece of driftwood. (That plan doesn't actually work long-term, either.)  Men often imagine winning a girl's affection by proving their worth in a battle against someone or something that threatens their loved one's life. While many women want the men in their lives to be sensitive like Ryan Gosling's "Notebook" character Noah, guys aspire to be like the renegade John McClane in "Die Hard."  John offers a brand of masculinity and strength that men can look up to (akin to what John Wayne and Clint Eastwood once offered moviegoers). John doesn't back down and he never gives up. The cold and calculating Hans may mock John for his cowboy mentality, his freewheeling spirit and his assumed affection for masculine film actors of the past (like Wayne). But John doesn't care what Hans thinks. John just keeps killing bad guys.  While separated from his wife, John shows his love for her by killing terrorists and trying to protect her. Compare that to Gosling's Noah: When he's separated from the girl he loves, he writes love letters. How does John send messages in "Die Hard"? He writes notes on the sweatshirts of dead terrorists, and in one scene even throws a dead terrorist out a window to send a message to a passing police officer. That's how he communicates.  The climactic scenes at the end of "Die Hard" prove why it's a perfect Valentine's Day flick for guys.  There is no declaration of love between John and his wife. There is no grand romantic gesture that shows how much he cares for her. As the story concludes, John McClane  who has been shot, brutalized and cut by hundreds of pieces of glass  has proven his love for his wife by killing all the terrorists who threatened her.  And with that, he gets the girl and they make out in the back seat of a limo.  Now that's love.

The sun hadn't risen at Garissa University College. Most students slept in their beds. A few had woken up to head to early morning Christian prayers.  Then the terror began.  It started with an explosion and gunshots around 5:30 a.m. Thursday (10:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) at the Kenyan school's front gates. The attackers continued to fire as they stalked through campus, with the Red Cross saying they stopped at a girls' dormitory.  At one point, they burst into a room where Christians had gathered and took hostages, said lecturer Joel Ayora. A student in the room told Alex Kubasu, a reporter with CNN affiliate Citizen TV, that the terrorists sprayed bullets indiscriminately, striking his thigh.  "Then they proceeded to the hostels," Ayora told CNN, referring to the university dorm, "shooting anybody they came acrossexcept their fellows, the Muslims."  According to AFP, the gunmen separated the students by religion and allowed Muslims to leave. This would be consistent with the past practices of Al-Shabaab, the Somalia-based terror group that's claimed responsibility for the attack. That's what Al-Shabaab did in a December raid on a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, near the Somali border, that ended with at least 36 killed.  Whatever their religion, hundreds of students managed to escape, said Dennis Okari, a reporter with CNN affiliate NTV.  Some ran. Some crawled. All feared for their lives.  And they were the lucky ones.  It wasn't until about 15 hours after the attack began that the explosions and gunfire around Garissa finally ended. Interior Ministry Secretary Joseph Nkaissery announced that four terrorists were killed and the operation had ended "successfully."  By then, 147 people were dead and plans were "underway to evacuate students and other affected persons," the Kenya National Disaster Operation Centre tweeted.  "It is a very sad day for Kenya," Nkaissery said.  Some of those students, at one point or another, were believed to be hostages in one of the four dormitories on campus.  Yet others like Ayora managed to find safety, in his case at the staff residence. Others escaped the college's grounds. Okari, for instance, told CNN that he saw about 200 people sitting in the scorching mid-90-degree heat Thursday in a corner of a Garissa airstrip, surrounded by military officials.  One student, Japhet Mwala, recalled to AFP how "everyone started running" after hearing blasts and gunshots.  "There were those who were not able to leave the hostels where the gunmen headed and started firing," Mwala said. "I am lucky to be alive, because I jumped through the fence with other students."  Rosalind Mugambi fled into a nearby field with "bullets following us." She escaped unscathed, but a few of her friends did not.  "We saw some bloodstains,"  Mugambi told AFP, "and they were shot."  Such terrorism, sadly, isn't new to the people of eastern Kenya. And that's largely thanks to Al-Shabaab.  While it is based in Somalia, the militant group has made bloody incursions into neighboring Kenyamost notoriously a 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall that left at least 67 dead.  A primary aim of such attacks is thought to be sowing terror. There's also a religious undercurrent, given Al-Shabaab's once and possibly future goal of creating a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Needless to say, that aim isn't shared in most placesparticularly in Kenya, where more than 80% of citizens are Christian.  Such violence is more likely in towns like Garissa, given its location 90 miles west of the Somali border.  What makes Thursday's attack different is what was targetedan institute of higher learning, presumably filled with innocent students with no direct part in the Kenyan and allied governments' fight against Al-Shabaab. Such an attack is more reminiscent of what other Islamist extremist groups, the Pakistani Taliban and Boko Haram, did in respectively attacking a school in Peshawar, Pakistan, and kidnapping more than 200 girls at a school in Chibok, Nigeria.  Garissa University College began in the 1990s as Garissa Teacher Training College before evolving, by government decree, into its current form as a degree-granting institution in 2011.  As of this spring, the school had schools of education, information science, and arts and social sciences. And it was growing, with its staff of 75 set to expand to 200 by year's end, according to the college's website.  It's too early to tell what the future now holds for Garissa University College. But Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday urged people around the African nation "to stay calm as we resolve this matter."  "This is a moment," Kenyatta said, "for everyone throughout the country to be vigilant as we continue to confront and defeat our enemies."  CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.  
 Lagos, Nigeria If you are a young person living in Africa right now, it can be pretty confusing knowing what to believe: is it a hopeful place or is it trapped in a vicious cycle?  Is it the site of the world's fastest growing economies, or is it a place where more than 200 schoolgirls are kidnapped and held captive for two weeks with no hope of recovery?  On the one hand, much more than half of the employable young population is out of a job and there are many caught in wars and rumors of wars, from Sudan's two sides to the Central African Republic.  But on the other, there's growth and palpable excitement: Africa is the continent to watch; investment is pouring in for technology and a whole range of businesses both new and traditional, many countries boast impressive GDPs; democracy is solidifying, and with it free speech and citizen engagement, a flourishing sense of enterprise and a groundswell of creativity.  There is no greater symbol of this confusion than Nigeria at this exact moment.  On the one hand, we are the focus of the world, with our GDP rebased and our economy enjoying something of a rebirth; and yet on the other, we are the focus of the world, with bombs tearing through our nation's capital, and girls abducted in broad daylight by domestic terrorists.  With the World Economic Forum coming to Abuja this week, I see myself frenziedly planning alongside other Global Shapers across Lagos, Abuja and Kano to welcome the world to our country and to show its vast potential, looking forward to the sessions and the panels focused on inclusive growth and job creation.  At the same time I sit on the board of Enough is Enough Nigeria, which is passionately, angrily demanding that the world cancels the World Economic Forum on Africa to send a message to our lethargic president that he must find the 234 girls who have been missing for 18 days, and stop the violence that has taken the lives of over 1,500 in the north of Nigeria this year.  How can I be excited about going to Abuja next week for the Forum when a bomb just went off in the city's center?  Should I tweet #WEFAfrica, or #BringBackTheGirls?  Talk about schizophrenia.  I find myself confused, pulled in both directions. Yet I find both imperatives compelling, almost inevitable. I believe this is the most urgent challenge for young people like me, growing up in a time of great flux.  The world has so much faith in young Africans at the momentand with good reason; see what we've done with technology, the creative industries and civil society, for instanceurging and willing us to fulfill the promise that is in abundance amongst us, to become the "turning point generation."  But if only the world understood how frustrating it can be to have hope in the future of Nigeria when its power sector remains comatose, corrupt ministers collude with the legislature, people die in stadiums while jostling for jobs, and governments strangle small businesses with multiple taxation and out-of-touch policies.  We have the important duty to maintain hope, keep up the excitement; channel the energy and take advantage of the opportunities that exist around us.  But at the same time, we must maintain perspective, and avoid burying our heads in the sand; we must demand better governance and speak with clarity and integrity about the failings of our leaders in government and the private sector.  Our eyes must be fixed on the stars, but our feet must stand firmly on the ground.  It is a delicate balance, but we have no choice. We must play the hand our continent has dealt us. We have no choice.

On July 17, 1996, TWA Flight 800 took off from JFK Airport headed for Paris. Just 12 minutes later, it exploded over the shores of Long Island, New York. There were 230 people on board, and no one survived.  Many eyewitnesses described seeing something heading toward the plane before it exploded, and the suspicion of terrorism was almost instant. The biggest investigation in aviation history, at that time, ensued.  The government spent four years and millions of dollars in that investigation and 18 years later, many still question whether they got it right.  With that in mind, here are five surprising things you probably didn't know about the investigation, including one big thing the investigators themselves still don't know:  1. The FBI interviewed at least 755 witnesses.  TWA Flight 800 crashed eight miles off the coast of Long Island at dusk on a clear summer night. Hundreds of witnesses saw the plane explode from either on shore, on a boat, in a plane or in at least one case, a helicopter.  Of the 755 witness reports that the FBI have made public, accounts vary widely but hundreds describe what they thought was either a flare or fireworks heading up toward the plane before it exploded. A few witnesses even used the words "missile" or "rocket."  2. America was in a high state of alert when TWA 800 crashed.  A series of terrorism-related events in the years, months and weeks before the flight went down, and even one incident just days afterward, led many to suspect terrorism was to blame. December 21, 1988: Pan Am Flight 103 explodes over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 270 people on board. Eventually Libyan national Abdel Baset Ali Mohmed al Megrah is tried and found guilty of 270 counts of murder. February 26, 1993: A bomb explodes at the World Trade Center, killing six people and injuring more than 1000. Two years later, Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of that attack, is arrested in Pakistan by the FBI and the State Department and put on trial. "I am a terrorist and proud of it," he told the court. April 19, 1995: The Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City is bombed. The blast destroys large parts of the building and kills 168 people, including 19 children. Two Americans, Timothy J. McVeigh and Terry L. Nichols, are eventually convicted for the attack. May 29, 1996: Yousef goes on trial in New York City. The trial continues through the crash of TWA Flight 800, leading many to question if the two were related. June 25, 1996: The Khobar Towers are attacked. A powerful truck bomb explodes on the perimeter of a U.S. military complex in eastern Saudi Arabia. Nineteen U.S. Air Force personnel are killed, and several hundred are wounded, in the deadliest attack against the American military since a 1983 bombing of the Marine headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. July 17, 1996: TWA Flight 800 explodes over the shores of Long Island. July 27, 1996: A bomb explodes at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, killing one person and injuring over 100. More than two years later, Eric Robert Rudolph, a suspect in bombings at abortion clinics in Alabama, is charged in the Olympic Park bombing.  Covering the crash: One CNN reporter remembers  3. Moammar Gadhafi and Saddam Hussein were suspects.  Beyond terrorist groups being suspected, state-sponsored terrorism was also cause for concern inside the White House. Leon Panetta, former secretary of Defense and former CIA director, was chief of staff for President Bill Clinton at the time of the crash.  "The investigation was looking at almost every possibility, including state actors, because we'd known that Libya had been involved with regards to bringing down the airliner over Scotland (Pam Am Flight 103)", said Panetta. "We were looking at Iraq and Saddam Hussein. We were looking at, you know, the possibility of even Iran might have played a role in this," added Panetta.  4. It took close to a year, but all 230 victims were eventually recovered.  There were 230 people on board TWA Flight 800 from 13 countries. When the plane crashed into the water, much of what was left sunk 130 feet below the surface in the Atlantic Ocean.  While it took authorities more than 10 months, remains of every victim were recovered. All of their names are etched into the TWA Flight 800 International Memorial at Smith Point County Park on Long Island, New York.  The memorial was dedicated on July 14, 2004, and it includes flags from the 13 countries of the victims.  5. The NTSB said a spark in a fuel tank led to the explosion  In November 1997, more than a year after the crash, the FBI announced that a criminal act did not bring down the ill-fated plane. At that point, it was up to the National Transportation Safety Board to figure out the cause of the explosion.  A full four years after the crash of TWA Flight 800, the NTSB released its official report: It found the probable cause of the accident was a spark in the center fuel tank that eventually led to the explosion that brought down the aircraft. While they offered their best theory on where the spark came from, they never found a definitive answer.

 WASHINGTON Freshman U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson refused to back down Wednesday from remarks made on the House floor the night before, in which he said the Republican health care plan calls for sick people to "die quickly."  Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, made the "die quickly" remark on the House floor Tuesday night.  In fact, Grayson, a Democrat who represents a central Florida swing district that includes Orlando, made another floor speech in which he apologized to the dead and their families for not acting sooner on health care reform. He then defended both speeches on CNN's "The Situation Room."  "What I mean is they have got no plan," Grayson told Wolf Blitzer. "It's been 24 hours since I said that. Where is the Republican plan? We're all waiting to see something that will take care of the pre-existing conditions, to take care of the 40 million Americans who have no coverage at all.  "That's what I meant when I said that the Republican plan is don't get sick. And if you do get sick, die quickly."  Watch Grayson defend comments   Republicans pounced on Grayson's late-night speech and demanded an apology.  Watch Grayson's "die quickly" remark on House floor   "That is about the most mean-spirited partisan statement that I've ever heard made on this floor, and I, for one, don't appreciate it,"  Rep. Jimmy Duncan, R-Tennessee, told Politico.  On Wednesday, Grayson apologized, but it wasn't the apology the Republicans wanted.  Citing a Harvard University study released this month that said 44,000 Americans die each year because they have no health insurance, Grayson called on Democrats and Republicans "to do our jobs for the sake of those dying people and their families."  "I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America," he said.  That prompted National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Ken Spain to issue a stinging rebuke, saying Grayson is "doubling down on his despicable remarks, and he is dragging his party with him."  "This is an individual who has established a pathological pattern of unstable behavior," Spain said. "He is derailing the national debate on health care reform and embarrassing his constituents as a result."  But in a spirited discussion on CNN that included Democratic strategist James Carville and Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, Grayson stood his ground. He rejected the suggestion that his remarks were the political equivalent of South Carolina Republican Rep. Joe Wilson's shout of, "You lie," at the president during his nationally televised speech on health care.  "I didn't insult the president in front of 40 million people," he said. " ... When you don't have a plan, what that means is your plan is don't get sick. So what I said is true. What Joe Wilson said, on the other hand, is false."  Castellanos insisted that Republicans agreed with the Democrats on pre-existing conditions and would "stand with him 100 percent" if the president added such Republican-backed proposals as tort reform and allowing citizens to shop across state lines for insurancea strategy Democrats say will drive insurance companies into the states with the most lax regulations.  "The congressman is at least giving the chance for the Republicans to look responsible. It's not fair to say that the Republicans have no plan. They actually do," said Castellanos, whose campaigns include those of George W. Bush in 2004, Mitt Romney in 2008, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the late Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina in the 1990s.  Carville, who was Bill Clinton's lead strategist during his successful run for the presidency in 1992 and worked on Hillary Clinton's campaign last year, congratulated Grayson for having "the courage to go up and say what he said."  But Carville backed away from Grayson when the congressman said that Republicans he believes are obstructing health care reform are "foot-dragging, knuckle-dragging Neanderthals."  "I would call [them] regressive as opposed to Neanderthal," Carville said.  Grayson also rejected comparisons between his comments and those of some Republicans, including former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, that the Democratic reform plan called for "death panels" to decide who would get life-saving treatments.  "I said to myself, 'I wish Sarah Palin read the bill.' That's not what this bill says. That's a scare tactic," he said. "What I said is the God's honest truth."  Grayson said he decided to deliver his after-hours speech Tuesday after the Harvard study was released and he realized "we cannot go on any longer in this country where people cannot afford health care, where the coverage they got is good until they need it."  Calling for universal health care, he slammed "whoever it is that's causing the Republicans to fight tooth-and-nail against anything, absolutely anything, to have every vote come down to being 257 to 175 in the House, over and over and over again."  "Those are the people who are really disserving Americans," he said.  CNN's Alexander Mooney contributed to this report.

Buenos Aires, Argentina An Argentine court this week granted an injunction that blocks internet giant Google from "suggesting" searches that lead to certain sites that have been deemed anti-Semitic, and removes the sites from the search engine's index.  The injunction, filed by DAIA, an umbrella organization of Argentina's Jewish community, also prohibits Google from advertising on the stated websites.  The injunction names 76 sites that the organization considers "highly discriminatory."  Google's suggested searches are a Google algorithm that offers search terms similar to the one the user appears to be typing in.  "The common denominator on these sites is the incitement of hate and the call to violence," DAIA said in a statement. "In none of these cases are there discussions or criticisms from the academic, technological, political or philosophical perspectives."  Google representatives in the United States and Argentina did not immediately respond to calls for comment.  Argentina has the largest Jewish population in Latin America. The Jewish community there numbers more than 250,000, with the majority residing in the capital, Buenos Aires.  The ruling notes that restrictions on freedom of speech and censorship is illegal under the Argentine constitution, but also notes that the constitution protects people from discrimination. As such, the judge cited previous cases in Argentina that establish that in some restricted cases, it is permissible to prevent the diffusion of certain publications if they infringe on someone's personal rights.  Judge Carlos Molina Portela concluded that "the terms mentioned (in the lawsuit) as well as the results obtained through 'suggested searches' could be described as discriminatory acts and/or at least, incitement and/or encouragement for discrimination."  According to DAIA, the suggested search complaint focused on 13 terms that led to websites that are anti-Semitic, some of which deny that the Holocaust took place. The group did not disclose the 13 terms in question, nor the names of the websites that were blocked.  In a statement, the group said that by suggesting these websites, Google is "inducing and directing traffic to sites with offensive and illegal content."  In Argentina, there have been previous cases in which individuals have sued to have certain websites removed from Google's index, citing invasion of privacy, said Robert Faris, research director for the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.  The court actions in Argentina appear to view Google more as a publisher of information than as an intermediary, he said.  "It seems to reflect a misunderstanding of how the internet works and how search engines work," he said.  Cynthia Wong, director of the Global Internet Freedom Project at the Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology, said the Argentine court's move was part of a "problematic trend" on the part of many governments.  "At the end of the day, enlisting companies to become greater gatekeepers on content online really does shrink the range of speech that we can access. ... It's dangerous to try to shut down speech, because you don't get that kind of robust public debate about what should or should not be acceptable in a democratic society," she said.  While restrictions on the internet are usually associated with countries such as China or Iran, it is not uncommon for other nations to try to impose some limits on it.  Thailand, for example, asked Google to remove YouTube videos that showed the Thai king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, with feet near his head. In Thai culture, it's considered extremely offensive for anyone's feet to be near someone's head.  A national law bans such representations, and Google agreed not to show such videos within Thailand, although they are still available elsewhere in the world.  Germany bans neo-Nazi content, and Google has agreed to remove such sites from its Google.de search engine in that country. Turkey, meanwhile, blocks YouTube because the company refused to take down all potentially offensive videos about Ataturk, the Turkish political hero.  "It's a slippery slope. I don't think that the people of Argentina are harmed by the inability to see anti-Semitic content, but I think that the best answer is counter-speech,"said Ryan Calo, a researcher at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.  He noted that Google, faced with anti-Semitic search results in the United States, responded by posting an ad with a link to a statement that includes a link to information from the Anti-Defamation League.  "If you recently used Google to search for the word 'Jew,' you may have seen results that were very disturbing. We assure you that the views expressed by the sites in your results are not in any way endorsed by Google," Google's policy statement says.  It goes on to note that citizens and organizations have urged the company to remove links or adjust search results.  "Although Google reserves the right to address such requests individually, Google views the comprehensiveness of our search results as an extremely important priority," the statement says. "Accordingly, we do not remove a page from our search results simply because its content is unpopular or because we receive complaints concerning it."  CNN's Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.  
 A forceful Mitt Romney went toe-to-toe with President Barack Obama on the dominant issues for voters, challenging the Democrat's policies on the economy, taxes and health care in the first of three debates ahead of the November election.  In exchanges full of policy proposals, facts and figures, the Republican challenger was more aggressive in the 90-minute encounter in criticizing Obama's record and depicting the president's vision as one of big government.  The president firmly defended his achievements and challenged his rival's prescriptions as unworkable.  Neither candidate scored dramatic blows that will make future highlight reels, and neither veered from campaign themes and policies to date.  But Romney came off as the more energized candidate overall by repeatedly attacking Obama on red-meat issues for Republicans such as health care reform and higher taxes, while the president began with lengthy explanations and only later focused more on what his opponent was saying.  Moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS, at times, tried without success to keep the candidates within time limits for responses, especially Obama, who ended up speaking four minutes longer than Romney.  "A week ago, people were saying this was over. We've got a horse race," said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, who called the debate Romney's best so far after the 22 the former Massachusetts governor took part in during the GOP primary campaign.  Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, expressed surprise at Romney's strong performance, saying he "rose to the moment" and seemed to benefit from the multiple primary debates.  "It looked like Romney wanted to be there and President Obama didn't want to be there," noted Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville. "The president didn't bring his 'A' game."  A CNN/ORC International poll of 430 people who watched the debate showed 67% thought Romney won, compared to 25% for Obama.  Romney's strongest moments came in repeating his frequent criticism of Obama's record, saying the nation's high unemployment and sluggish economic recovery showed the president's policies haven't worked.  "There's no question in my mind if the president is re-elected, you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze," Romney said, adding that another term for Obama also will mean the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, "will be fully installed."  At another point, he noted how $90 billion spent on programs and policies to develop alternative energy sources could have been devoted to hiring teachers or other needs that would bring down unemployment.  Obama argued that his policies were working to bring America back from the financial and economic crisis he inherited, and that Romney refused to divulge specifics about his proposed tax plans and replacements for the health care reform act and Wall Street reform act that the Republican has pledged to repeal.  "At some point, the American people have to ask themselves if the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans secret is because they're too good," Obama said.  What questions went unanswered? Share your thoughts with CNN iReport  On taxes, Obama said Romney's plan of tax cuts for the rich had failed before and would fail again now.  Describing the Romney tax plan as a $5 trillion cut, Obama echoed a line from former President Bill Clinton by saying the math doesn't add up without increasing tax revenue, which Romney rejects  "I think math, common sense and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth," Obama said.  Romney, however, said Obama still pushed the same policies as when he took office four years earlier, and those steps had failed to bring down high unemployment and get the economy surging again.  He rejected Obama's characterization of his tax plan, saying it won't add to the deficit, and criticized the president's call for allowing tax rates on income over $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals to return to the higher rates of the 1990s.  "The National Federation for Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don't want to cost jobs," Romney said.  Obama responded that the revenue issue is "a major difference" he has with Romney, noting the former Massachusetts governor rejected the idea of cutting $10 in spending for every $1 in new revenue during the Republican primary campaign.  Complete coverage: CNN's election center  In his strongest line of the night, Obama said Romney lacked the important leadership quality of being able to say "no" when necessary.  "I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party," Obama said in reference to his challenger's swing to the right during the primaries to appeal to the GOP's conservative base.  Romney repeatedly went after Obama on the health care reform bill, at one point asking why the president focused so strongly on a measure that passed with no Republican support instead of devoting more attention to the high unemployment and creaking economy.  With polls narrowing less than five weeks before Election Day, Obama and Romney launched a new phase in a bitter race dominated so far by negative advertising as both camps try to frame the election to their advantage.  Whether it matters is itself a topic of debate. According to an analysis by Gallup, televised debates have affected the outcome of only two elections in the past half centuryNixon-Kennedy in 1960 and Bush-Gore in 2000.  Debates by the numbers  Both candidates had their wives in the audience at the University of Denver in Colorado for the debate taking place on the 20th wedding anniversary of the president and first lady Michelle Obama.  Obama opened the debate by promising his wife they wouldn't be celebrating their anniversary next year in front of 40 million people, and Romney joked that Obama found the most romantic place possible for the anniversary.  Analysts say Obama needed a presidential performance rather than fireworks or haymakers in order to maintain and build on a narrow edge in polls that indicate a very close election on November 6.  Romney, who has been unable to catch the president in most of the polls to date, sought to generate enthusiasm for a change in the White House as the nation wrestles with seemingly chronic economic problems such as mounting federal deficits and debt.  5 things to watch in tonight's debate  Lehrer, moderating his 12th presidential debate, planned to break up the debate into 15-minute segments focusing on different aspects of the economy and other domestic issues. However, the exchanges by the candidates scrambled the format, with the opening discussion on taxes lasting more than 20 minutes.  Debate time: The candidates' version of the two-minute drill  The two candidates shook hands and shared a laugh after being introduced by Lehrer as the audience applauded before being asked to remain silent for the remainder of the debate. At one point, a loud bang off-stage seemed to surprise Romney in mid-sentence, and Obama looked behind him to try to see what happened.  The other presidential debates will occur on October 16 in New York and October 22 in Florida. Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Romney's running mate, will debate on October 11 in Kentucky.

Washington A pandemic is one of the few things with the power to stop the global economy in its tracks. Dr. Larry Brilliant is confident that doesn't have to happen.  After all, he was on the ground in Bangladesh to see the very last case of "killer" smallpox in the world. After 2-year-old Rahima Banu recovered following treatment, the World Health Organization declared the wicked disease was over in 1980.  "I'm the luckiest guy in the world," said Brilliant. "There's nothing better than working in a program like that and to know that something that horrible no longer exists."  Speaking Thursday at the annual TEDMED conference in Washington, Brilliant made the case that several key actions will stop pandemics: early detection, early response and better cooperation among governments.  Some 2,000 health professionals and thought leaders from all sectors of society are attending TEDMED at the Kennedy Center this week for a series of talks, which are also being televised in more than 80 countries.  "With all of these viruses, we have to isolate them locally and put them in jail. It's the only way to deal with a pandemic," said Brilliant, now president of the Skoll Global Threats Fund. "Early warning systems are essential to protect us from the things that are humanity's worst nightmare."  "A pandemic would have not just deaths and medical consequences, but alsosocial disruption. There would be global recession and depression. Millions would lose their jobs. There would be no Internet and no flights," explains Brilliant. "Would you get on an airplane with 250 people coughing and sneezing, when you knew some of them might carry a disease that could kill you? It would be apocalyptic."  SARS 10 years on: How dogged detective work defeated an epidemic  Early detection is working. "In 1996, it took almost half a year167 daysto discover a potential pandemic. By 2009, it took only 23 days," says Brilliant. "The question is, how can we make that better? If we can drive that number down to a few days, to just one incubation period, it may be 100 years before that virus has the same mutationmaybe never."  Early response and treatment are making a difference too.  "Viruses are much more fragile than you think," he said. "H7N9, now circulating in China, doesn't go person to personit has to go from birds or pigs to people. That makes it more complicated to spread. So things have to go just right for a virus to become a pandemic. That's why it's important to contain it in one country."  Just as the ease of international travel and the growth of global food supply chains help spread virulent new viruses, emerging technologies offer solutions to keep them at bay.  "We can find cases earlier with digital detectionWeb self-reporting, SMS, Twitter, social networking, blogging, Internet searches, online news and health reporting," said Brilliant, who was previously executive director of Google.org.  In that capacity, Brilliant helped develop a search system to try and beat the timeline of the official flu outbreak reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It worked.  "CDC reporting requires a patient to see a doctor, the doctor to gather samples and the samples to be analyzed," explains Brilliant. "It's a lot faster using crowd-sourcing technologya cellphone or a computer that simply asks a person, 'Are you healthy or sick?' "  Currently, there are dozens of nonprofit sites that track disease outbreaks in real time, including healthmap.org and instedd.org. "Now, we really can see the flu coming and quickly know how to protect ourselves," said Brilliant.  For decades, the WHO accepted information on potential outbreaks only through official channelsvia, for example, a health minister. In 2007, the rules changed. Data now flows in through government and independent reporting.  Brilliant notes that some countries are going even farther. Through the recent launch of CORDS, a new entity bringing together regional disease surveillance networks, 28 different countries officially cooperate, sharing information to curb epidemics before they become pandemics.  H1N1 death toll may be 15 times higher than previously reported  "We have to enlist everyone's support," Brilliant said. "We are all in this together. Polio and guinea worm soon will be eradicatedand I hope to see a photo finish there.  "Eighty countries came together to end smallpoxthe disease that reigned for more than two centuries, killing pharaohs and kings, is completely gone. Today, we are finding diseases faster than anyone ever imagined. Innovations in early detection, early response and global cooperation can put an end to pandemics. We are closer every day."  
 The Utah Supreme Court has reversed Warren Steed Jeffs' two convictions on charges of rape as an accomplice and ordered a new trial, saying that instructions given to jurors were erroneous.  Jeffs, the "prophet" of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or FLDS, was sentenced to two consecutive terms of five years to life after he was convicted in September 2007. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marrying her 19-year-old cousin.  "We regret the effect our opinion today may have on the victim of the underlying crime, to whom we do not wish to cause additional pain," the court said. "However, we must ensure that the laws are applied evenly and appropriately, in this case as in every case."  In Jeffs' trial, Elissa Wall testified that she repeatedly told him at the time that she did not want to be married and was uncomfortable with sexual advances from her husband, Allen Steed. She said Jeffs advised her to pray and submit to her husband, learn to love him and bear his children, or risk losing her "eternal salvation."  Wall was 21 at the time of Jeffs' conviction in 2007. Her attorneys made her name public at the end of the trial, with her consent. She is married to someone else and has left the FLDS.  The first count of rape as an accomplice against Jeffs was alleged to have occurred shortly after Wall and Steed were married, when the two first had sex, the Utah Supreme Court opinion said. The second was alleged to have occurred after Jeffs refused to "release" Wall from her marriage and told her to "give herself to [Steed] ... mind, body and soul."  Prosecutors relied on three separate portions of the law defining the circumstances under which sex is non-consensual, the opinion said. Under those portions, the victim must express a lack of consent through words or conduct, the victim must be younger than 18 years, and "the actor" must be in a position of special trust in relation to the victim.  "Jeffs argues that the instruction erroneously focused the jury on Jeffs' actions and position of special trust, rather than on Steed's, for the purpose of determining whether Wall consented," the opinion said.  The justices agreed, saying the jurors should have been asked to consider whether Steed was in a position of special trust and whether Steed lured or induced Wall into having sex.  "The state interprets the term 'actor' to mean the 'defendant,' " the opinion said. "We conclude that the state's interpretation is erroneous."  "We're thrilled," said Jeffs' defense attorney, Wally Bugden. "We're overjoyed. We're ecstatic that the Supreme Court agreed with us. ... The state just had the wrong legal theory."  Jeffs is "an unpopular religious figure in our state," Bugden said, and the media have "had a field day portraying him as an evil, horrible, pernicious individual." The court, he said, was able to put that aside and base its decision on the evidence and legal theories, not on emotion, and determine that the erroneous instructions led jurors to "an erroneous result."  The defense has always maintained that marrying someone, encouraging them to make their marriage work and "be fruitful and multiply ... that is not the same thing as saying to a husband, 'I'm encouraging you to rape your wife,' " Bugden said.  He said he had not had a chance to speak to Jeffs but planned to do so Tuesday afternoon.  Assistant Utah Attorney General Laura Dupaix told CNN affiliate KSTU that the opinion is "going to make it difficult, I think, for us to do future prosecutions in cases where some of these men in positions of poweralmost complete power, like Warren Jeffs isto prosecute them for forcing young girls into these marriages. I think that's really the part of this opinion that is most disappointing for us."  The justices sent the case back to the lower court for a new trial.  The state has 14 days to request a rehearing with the Utah Supreme Court, said Nancy Volmer, spokeswoman for Utah state courts. The justices would then grant or deny that petition. If a request is not made, the case will be sent back to the trial court within 30 days, and the lower District Court then has 30 days to schedule a hearing.  Jeffs is being held at the Utah State Prison in Draper, about 30 miles south of Salt Lake City. The issue of whether he should be released pending a new trial would be addressed at the District Court hearing, Volmer said.  However, Bugden said, Jeffs will be transferred back to Washington County in southern Utah, where he was convictedand closer to the FLDS community. "We will be asking for bail," he said.  But Jeffs has a federal indictment against him for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, said Melodie Rydalch, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys' Office in Utah. The indictment states Jeffs traveled across state lines in 2006 to avoid prosecution.  "There are federal detainers in place with the Utah State Prison and Washington County," Rydalch said. "Although his attorney is saying he will ask for a bail hearing in the Utah state court, our federal detainers are in place."  Rydalch added if Jeffs is not held on state charges, authorities will bring him into federal custody.  Bugden said he expects Washington County prosecutors to decide quickly whether they want to proceed with the case.  Jeffs had been awaiting trial in Arizona on four charges of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor. But last month, a judge dismissed those charges. Matt Smith, the Mohave County, Arizona, prosecutor, had asked the court to throw out the charges, citing "much more serious charges" against Jeffs in Texas and the desire of his alleged victims that he "face these more serious charges as soon as possible."  Jeffs was indicted in Texas in 2008 on a felony charge of sexual assault of a child. An indictment accuses Jeffs of assaulting a child "younger than 17 years of age and not legally married to the defendant" in January 2005. If convicted on the Texas charges, Jeffs could face a maximum penalty of five to 99 years or life in prison and a fine of $10,000.  The FLDS drew national attention when Jeffs was arrested during a routine traffic stop in August 2006. At the time, he was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.  The sect is a 10,000-member offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church. Its members openly practice polygamy at the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, and in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line: Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Critics of the sect say young girls are forced into "spiritual" marriages with older men and are sexually abused. Sect members have denied that any sexual abuse takes place.  Jeffs had led the sect since his father's death in 2002.

An expanding digital marketplace, financial stability and strong economic growth; Estonia is setting the pace for other European nations, according to the Baltic nation's leader.  Speaking with CNN's Isa Soares, Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves said that the country developed a reputation for its digital economy "from a level playing field" with other nations after it gained independence in 1993.  "We did, in the 1990s, look around us and see a lot of things that we needed to do in the world," he said. "We were behind in many areas. When it came to IT... we were starting more or less at the same base as everyone else. We started with a tabula rasa, a clean slate."  Read more: General Electric exec to Europe: Open your borders, create jobs  Having emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union and decades under communist rule, Estonia's economy now generates 1% of its GDP [Gross Domestic Product] from IT solutions, according to Ilves.  He added: "Our e-governance solution, banking, private sector... are more secure and quicker."  With the lowest government debt in Europe, Estonia's economy is also a beacon for financial prudence at a time when many European nations are struggling to cope with high government debt and low growth.  Read more: Spain's booming Rioja economy  Asked why Estonia is the poster child for economic stability, Ilves joked: "Well, for one, we followed the rules."  He added: "It is quite clear that if the eurozone is to be viable, that the kinds of behavior that we have seen, either fiscal irresponsibility, or in some cases even lying about deficits, well that is completely unacceptable."

Read more: How saffron could save Greek farmers  Allan Sikk, an expert in Eastern Europe at the University College of London, said that Estonia's meteoric rise and assimilation into the West is partly due to the country emerging from the Soviet Union with a stronger economy than most of its counterparts.  "It was also close to some very rich countries like Finland and Sweden that provided export markets and investments."  Today, the Baltic nation is joining its affluent Nordic partners in financing the struggling countries of southern Europe.  A state of affairs that according to Ilves, is politically "tough" to justify when a "relatively poor country" like Estonia is bailing out richer nations that "have not been following the rules."

While Estonia's prospects look rosy, the 17-nation eurozone remains under the yoke of a prolonged debt crisis with a contraction of 0.4 % forecast for 2013.  But Ilves is hopeful that Europe's single currency area has emerged from the "worst phase."  "It will be a slow recovery, we won't be back to the go-go years of booming economies yet," he added, "but if you look at our country and other countries that started the reforms early, they're doing better [and] growth is faster... so that's the proof."  
 Jonathan Trappe, the American who aimed to cross the Atlantic Ocean suspended from 370 helium-filled balloons, has aborted his mission just 12 hours and about 470 miles into the journey, his Facebook page says.  The 39-year-old IT project manager from Raleigh, North Carolina, was forced to make an early landing in a remote part of Newfoundland, Canada, because of a technical issue.  "Hmm, this doesn't look like France," Trappe posted to his Facebook page late Thursday, along with the coordinates of his landing.  Via his messaging system, Trappe spoke to Barcroft Media, a British company he partnered with. He said he feared he might die as he attempted to crash-land his balloon contraption.  "Honestly did not know if I would survive that landing!" Trappe said of touching down in pitch darkness near Blow Me Down Provincial Park in the wilderness of Newfoundland.  He then messaged, "Situation stable. Have 60l water 38L. Gatorade 60,000 cal food. Have shelter and exposure gear."  Trappe said he would stay the night at his landing site before grabbing what gear he couldincluding footage he took of the shorter-than-planned tripand making his way home.  Canadian teams have begun searching the forest where Trappe crash-landed. If the patrol is unsuccessful, Trappe, who has confirmed he is safe and well on Facebook, is prepared to spend another night in the mountainous region, which is populated by black bears and moose, said Sgt. Richard White of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  If the teams can't find him, or if he can't get a commercial team to extract him, he plans to make his way out of the mountainous forest on foot and head to a local community.  Fans followed the adventurer's movements on a website that showed his longitude and latitude along the journey via a satellite tracker he took with him.  Trappe took off from Caribou, Maine, early Thursday with 370 balloons.  "Nobody has ever made a flight like this, using only small helium balloonsin manned flightacross the ocean," Trappe wrote on his website, clusterballoon.com, after the style of ballooning used in his attempt to across the Atlantic.  In 2010, he was the first person to cross the English Channel using a balloon cluster.  Five people have died trying to cross the Atlantic with balloons. Trappe spent two years preparing for the transatlantic flight, and his trip to Europe was supposed to take about a week.  "While disappointing that he had to cut his quest across the Atlantic short, I know Jonathan thanks everyone for their support and encouragement," said Trappe's friend, Kevin Knapp, who monitored the trip from a command center on the ground.

Ferguson, Missouri Loistine Hoskin cared for her old car as a sentimental possession, missing a tire while parked beside her home, until one day the city ticketed her for having a "derelict vehicle in driveway."  A tow truck took it away in 2009.  So began an odyssey with Ferguson police, municipal court and city hall that left her with $1,200 in fines that to this day she still doesn't fully understand. She paid the sum because endless court hearings about the car wore her down.  "I don't have a lawyer. I'm not a lawyer. It's me going up against the city of Ferguson when the attorneys won't help," Hoskin said this week.  She never saw again her 1996 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight with 168,000 miles. Its location is a mystery. She accepts the loss because at least she's not  in jail, where city authorities threatened to put her at one point, she said.  While Hoskin's surrender of both car and $1,200 to the city may seem a matter of personal choice, the U.S. Justice Department revealed this week a "pattern and practice" of racial discrimination within Ferguson that may lend credibility to Hoskin's account of a government run amok.  Just about every branch of Ferguson governmentpolice, municipal court, city hallparticipated in "unlawful" targeting of African-American residents such as Hoskin for tickets and fines, the Justice Department concluded this week.  The millions of dollars in fines and fees paid by black residents served an ultimate goal of satisfying "revenue rather than public safety needs," the Justice Department found.  To the outside world, the federal findings were staggering, but to Hoskin and other longtime residents, the conclusion was nothing new. They've felt it all along, they say.  It's only now that federal authorities have documented the institutionalized racism, as part of a civil rights investigation after a white police officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown, 19, last summer. The officer, Darren Wilson, was cleared of federal civil rights violations this week and was earlier cleared of criminal wrongdoing.  The Justice Department is expected to pursue a court-supervised consent decree that requires the city of Ferguson to make changes to its police and courts.  "It's definitely a vicious cycle," said Hoskin, 64, a retired airline reservation agent. "Unfortunately for most people who are in this cycle, they continue to be in a downward spiral because they can't get jobs, they can't do anything, they can't pay the fines."  Hoskin's household has experienced its share of ugly encounters with Ferguson police, the family said.  Hoskin's daughter was ticketed by police in what she described as racial profiling, she said.  In 2007, Kimberly Hoskin got a $124 ticket for driving her sister's car, which wasn't insured in Missouri, and then had to pay an additional $100 fine when she missed a court appearance because of an emergency appendectomy.  The court, she said, rejected her medical excuse and issued a warrant for her arrest.  She paid a total of $224 in fines because she was in the middle of a job search and didn't want an outstanding warrant to prevent her from getting a good job.  "Why is it that all the people in court are black?" Kimberly Hoskin said of defendants in municipal court. "I've had so many police officers make a U-turn, follow me, run my plates, find out everything is OK, then turn around and go back in the direction they were going.  "There's nothing we can do. In Ferguson, the police do what they want to do. Ferguson does what it wants," said Kimberly Hoskin, 35, who now works the overnight shift on a General Motors manufacturing line.  City officials and police declined to respond to CNN's requests this week for comment about the Hoskin family's assertions.  Last September, the City Council repealed administrative fees imposed by police when overseeing the release of a towed vehicle, the mayor said.  The city also no longer has a specific offense for failing to appear in court, which eliminates certain additional fees and court costs, the mayor said.  The Justice Department's report details how Ferguson operated a vertically integrated systemfrom street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration to city councilto raise revenue for the city budget through increased ticketing and fining.  Ferguson's budget increases were so sizable that city officials exhorted police and court staff to levy more and more fines and tickets against violators, who turned out to be largely African-American, the Justice Department said.  The demands for revenue were so intense that the police department had "little concern with how officers do this," even disciplining officers who failed to issue an average of 28 tickets a month, the Justice Department report said.  Officers competed "to see who could issue the largest number of citations during a single stop," the Justice Department said.  One apparent winner was an officer who issued 14 tickets at a single encounter, according to the federal investigation report.  Many police stops of civilians "have little relation to public safety and a questionable basis in law," the report said.  Ferguson police chief mum on federal report  Indeed, Ferguson enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that Ferguson, population 21,000, was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in St. Louis County by having more than $1 million in revenue in 2010, the report said.  When Ferguson court revenues exceeded $2 million in 2012, the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email: "Awesome! Thanks!" according to the federal report.  Even municipal judges were pressured to boost revenue.  "The city has made clear to the police chief and the municipal judge that revenue generation must also be a priority in court operations," the federal investigation found.  The city finance director said in a 2011 report that the municipal judge had been successful since 2003 in increasing court collections, and that internal 2011 city report noted a judge's statement that "none of these changes could have taken place without the cooperation of the court clerk, the chief of police, and the prosecutor's office," the Justice Department investigation found.  Cash filled the city treasury.  By 2013, revenue from enforcing municipal codes reached $2.46 million, the federal report said.  By 2015, the city anticipated that fines and fees would account for 23% of the budget, or $3.09 million of $13.26 million in general fund expenses, the Justice Department found.  Just five years earlier, court fines and fees made up only 12% of the budget, or $1.38 million of $11.07 million in general fund revenues, the Justice Department found.  The fines were among the highest of surrounding municipalities. For example, area parking fines ranged from $5 to $100, but Ferguson's parking fine was $102.  A fine for "weeds/tall grass" was $5 in one nearby city, but Ferguson's fine ranged from $77 to $102, the Justice Department found.  The federal government made a forceful conclusion:  "City, police and court officials for years have worked in concert to maximize revenue at every stage of the enforcement process, beginning with how fines and fine enforcement processes are established," the federal report said.  After the Justice Department's announcement this week, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told reporters that he, Police Chief Tom Jackson and City Attorney Stephanie Karr met with federal officials about their findings and initiated several initiatives, including reforms to the municipal court.  Knowles said municipal judges have created a docket for alleged offenders having trouble paying fines.  Also, a defendant may ask a judge or prosecutor about different payment plans or alternative sentencing, the mayor said. Defendants have been required to pay an entire fine at once, regardless of ability to pay, the federal report said.  The city also passed an ordinance last September to cap municipal court revenues at 15% of the city's overall budget, the mayor said. That figure is half Missouri's legal limit, he added.  All the reforms are intended to "move this city, its residents and our entire community forward," the mayor said.  Back at her home, Loistine Hoskin recalled the height of absurdity in her fight against the city, which occurred shortly after her husband, Calvin, died in 2008 of complications from paralysis he suffered in a car accident three years earlier. She had been his caregiver.  She appeared in court to appeal the citation, but an officer arrested her and put her in the back of the squad car.  Her offense?  Failing to appear in court, she said.  She spent four hours in jail. She insists she made every court date.  For now, she lives in fear of the police, even at home.  "We just got to a point where we said we're just not going to have anyone overbecause they were fearful when they left they would get some ticket, and they didn't even live here," Hoskin said.  CNN's Ed Lavandera and Tristan Smith contributed from Ferguson. Michael Martinez reported and wrote this story from Los Angeles.  
 There is no doubt that in our interconnected world, the G20 has a critical role to play in driving inclusive growth, creating jobs and increasing global living standards.  As a long-time advocate for reducing inequalityor to put it another way, upping the fairness factor in local and global economies alikeI am heartened to hear world leaders and policy-makers increasingly agree that growing inequality is undesirable.  But while we all agree that the world is facing an unprecedented number of large-scale, complex economic challenges, there remains heated discussion about the policy fixes needed.  The diagnoses of the world's ills are increasingly in alignmenteven News Corp chief executive Rupert Murdoch recently expressed concern about rising inequalitybut the suggested cures are fiercely contested.  Wealth gap increasingly 'obscene'  As economist Thomas Piketty so eloquently argued this year, wealth and the return on capital are growing faster than the overall economy and income from labor.  Making matters worse, labor income is becoming increasingly skewed, with an ever increasing share going to a small band of top earners.  This means we are approaching levels of inequality in wealth and income that are increasingly difficult to justify, increasingly obscene, and are an increasing drag on productivity and growth.  Inequality of this magnitude undermines the basic notions of trust, fairness, and social cohesion that underpin our economies and societies.  That's why civil society wants G20 nations to embed equity in their country growth plans by measuring improvements in the incomes of the bottom 20% of households.  The G20's commitment to pursuing economic growth of two percentage points above current targets over the next five years is welcome. But the success of the Brisbane talks must also be viewed through the lens of fairness. Leaders must be held to account for ensuring the benefits of growth are spread more widely.  G20 needs to change  Just as the G20 has evolved in recent years from a gathering of finance ministers to include national leaders, the involvement of non-government organizations in G20 meetings and decision-making is a reflection of the realities of contemporary governing and policy making.  Put simply: the continuing relevance and legitimacy of the G20 as an effective global economic policy-making body is reliant on it being more people-focused.  That means the realization among global policy agenda-setters that inequality and exclusion stifles economic growth must drive better responses to addressing the economic impact of climate change, for example, and the establishment of robust post-2015 sustainable development goals.  The way forward  The Australian presidency has no less a task than securing the G20's future. The jury is still out on whether its outreach to non-government actors and, importantly, to developing nations is enough to deliver this.  Consider the key agenda item of driving jobs growth. Governments must work with the corporate sector and the community as equal partners to provide real and quality jobs in the formal sector of the economy, with social and legal protections so that all workers, especially those from vulnerable groups, have the opportunity for improved participation.  The G20 is also poised to make genuine progress on glaring faults in global governance, via its tax reform and transparency agenda. The potential benefits of coordinated action to increase transparency range from strengthening efforts to combat corruption and money laundering, to finally countering tax evasion and avoidance.  It's time to end tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions, and the practices that allow earnings to be "washed" or hidden, as well as the lax residency standards and treaty shopping that allow profit shifting.  Aggressive tax planning alone is estimated to cost developing nations billions of dollars a year. These are the same countries which rely heavily on foreign aid and lack the resources to deal with poverty or fund essential health care and education services.  As governments of wealthy and developing nations alike decry their ability to "afford" to meet the growing demands placed on them by their citizens, they surely have no excuse to ignore the policy levers they have at their disposal to plug leaky and opaque tax systems.  Is it too much to ask that adequate health services, better education opportunities and even clean water no longer remain hostage to capricious and shady global tax arrangements?  I'd say it's only fair for the G20 to act.

Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have expressed their concern for the future of Rafael Nadal after their great tennis rival pulled out of this month's U.S. Open due to his ongoing knee problems.  The Spaniard withdrew from the season's final grand slam event on Wednesday, when Federer began his preparations at the Cincinnati Masters with a 6-3 6-2 win over Russia's Alex Bogomolov Jr.  "I wrote him and he told me it wasn't looking good at all. I kind of knew," world No. 1 Federer told reporters after setting up a third-round clash with Australian rising star Bernard Tomic.  "But obviously when it's official it's disappointing for tennis, there's no doubt about it. I would love to have him in the draw. In particular 12 days before the Open you figure he might still have time to fix what he has to fix to get ready.  "That's what is sort of scary. There is obviously the whole debate going on if he is going come back for this year. I hope he will. He's definitely got some more weeks off now because of it. I hope in hindsight this is a very smart decision by him. But it's obviously a big blow and disappointing news for the tennis world."  Former No. 1 Nadal won a record seventh French Open title in June after his customary busy clay season, but lost in the second round at Wimbledon and was unable to defend his Olympic singles title at London 2012.  "Tennis is going to lose a little bit because of Rafa not being there and playing, because he's somebody that has made a history of this sport," said U.S. Open champion Djokovic, who began his Cincinnati campaign with a hard-fought 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 win over Andreas Seppi of Italy, having retained his Toronto Masters title on Sunday.  "We all know how good he is and how popular he is. Obviously it's that serious that it takes him out from the tour for the last couple of months. I'm sure that if he was able to perform in the U.S .Open he would come."  Nadal and Djokovic had contested four successive grand slam finals, a run that was broken at Wimbledon when Federer beat Andy Murray to join Pete Sampras on seven titles at the grass major and reclaim the top ranking from the Serb.  Djokovic, last year's Cincinnati runner-up, is seeking to improve his form in his next match against Russian veteran Nikolay Davydenko.  "Really just trying to put another ball more in the court than my opponent was enough to win," he said. "I'm obviously not very satisfied with the performance. I will have to play much better than I did in order to go far."  Murray, who succeeded Nadal as the men's Olympic champion after a revenge win over Federer at Wimbledon this month, also paid tribute to a player he has faced in five grand slam semifinals and two quarterfinals.  "I like Rafa a lot as a friend. I'm disappointed for him," said the world No. 4, who beat American Sam Querrey 6-2 6-4 in his Cincinnati title defense opener, having pulled out in Toronto after his first match due to a knee worry of his own.  "It's obviously tough for him. He's had trouble with his knees in the past. So, you know, I hope he can rest, doesn't come back too early, and gets them fixed so he can get back to playing his best tennis."  The 25-year-old will be hoping for a good run in Cincinnati before continuing his quest for a first grand slam title at Flushing Meadows.  "In the immediate aftermath of big wins or good tournaments, normally you'll feel quite confident and comfortable going for your shots in the important moments and even at the beginning of matches," he said after setting up a third-round clash with France's Jeremy Chardy, who beat Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan 6-4 6-3.  "I'm hoping it helps me not only this week but going into the U.S. Open and big matches in the future. I think it will give me that extra bit of confidence and probably feel a bit calmer going into them."  Fifth seed Tomas Berdych will play 2011 Rookie of the Year Milos Raonic following a straight-forward 6-3 6-0 win over Chinese Taipei's Yen-Hsun Lu.  Canada's Raonic advanced courtesy of a battling 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 6-4 defeat of world No. 42 Marcos Baghdatis.  In the women's tournament, Venus Williams joined sister Serena in the last 16 after coming from behind to beat South Africa's Chanelle Scheepers 2-6 6-3 6-2.  Williams will next face French Open finalist Sara Errani of Italy, who she thrashed in straight sets at the Olympics.  Fourth seed Petra Kvitova, who had a first-round bye after winning her first title this year in Montreal on Monday, defeated Germany's Mona Barthel to earn a clash with China's Peng Shuai.  Montreal runner-up Li Na joined the Czech in round three, where the Chinese ninth sed will play Swedish qualifier Johanna Larsson, while Polish top seed Agnieszka Radwanska and former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki also progressed.  
 Havana, Cuba In all likelihood, the 91 Cuban health workers heading to West Africa on Tuesday will face the most perilous assignment of their careers.  They are joining 165 of their colleagues already working in the region to halt the spread of Ebola.  Although Cuban government officials say the majority of the health workers being sent to West Africa are veterans of previous tough postings, the risks that Ebola presents are unique.  "This is the biggest challenge I have ever faced in my life, it's a very dangerous disease," said Dr. Osmany Rodriguez, a Cuban who completed previous assignments in Zimbabwe and Venezuela. Rodriguez said he will soon be sent to treat people suffering from Ebola in either Liberia or Guinea.  "My family, they are a bit worried but they know I will be taking care of everything. They will trust in my daily habits and routines in order to avoid the disease," Rodriguez said.  Rodriguez spoke to CNN as he trained at the Pedro Kouri Institute for Tropical Diseases in Havana, where health workers are drilled by instructors provided by the World Health Organization on how to put on and take off seven different layers of clothing that provide protection from the epidemic.  "The important thing is to save lives," said Dr. Jorge Perez Avila, the institute's director. "Why are Cubans going to Africa? To save lives."  Cuban medical diplomacy is as old as the revolution that first brought the Castros to power, but its motivation is not purely altruistic. Sending health workers abroad boosts the image of a country whose human rights record is criticized. And in some cases, as with a program that sent thousands of Cuban doctors to Venezuela, the island gets paid back in trade, such as oil.  Cuba's Ebola efforts have already raised discussion about how it compares to what the United States is providing.  "While the United States and several other wealthy countries have been happy to pledge funds, only Cuba and a few nongovernmental organizations are offering what is most needed: medical professionals in the field," the New York Times opined in an editorial.  "It is a shame that Washington, the chief donor in the fight against Ebola, is diplomatically estranged from Havana, the boldest contributor. In this case the schism has life-or-death consequences, because American and Cuban officials are not equipped to coordinate global efforts at a high level," the editorial continues.  Cuba's health care system was degraded by the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early '90s. In recent years, the government has sent health workers to Venezuela and Brazil, in exchange for badly needed hard currency and oil. Those programs make up one of the largest sources of income for the island.  Still, the island continues to post health care workers to other developing nations and even before the Ebola crisis began, had over 4,000 doctors, nurses and technicians stationed in Africa.  "Our principle has been to share what we have and not to give what we don't," Perez said.  The Cuban health workers will work in West Africa for at least six months. If they themselves become infected, they have agreed not to be repatriated to Cuba for treatment, to avoid spreading the illness further.  On Monday, at an emergency summit in Havana of representatives from 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries, Cuban President Raul Castro said the danger presented by Ebola transcends borders and politics.  "We should try to avoid the politicization of this grave problem, which distracts us from the fundamental objective: helping to stop the epidemic in Africa and stop it from spreading to other regions," he said.  In a rare conciliatory gesture to the U.S. government, which Cuban officials typically deride as an imperialist power intent on wrecking the island's economy, Castro said the fight against Ebola should unite the two governments.  "Cuba is willing to work elbow-to-elbow with all countries," Castro said. "Including the U.S."  Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro also penned an editorial in the state-run newspaper this week, offering to "gladly cooperate with American personnel on this task" of fighting Ebola.  In a similar gesture in 2005, Cuba offered to send a team of doctors to aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The U.S. government ignored the request.  Possibly signaling that it recognized the boost Cuba gains from medical diplomacy, the U.S. government in 2006 announced a program to entice Cuban doctors to defect. The Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program allows Cuban health professional working in a third country at the behest of the Cuban government to defect to the United States.  While so far not accepting the Cuban offer to cooperate in the fight against Ebola, US officials have also praised the Communist government's efforts to stop the epidemic.  "Already we are seeing nations large and small stepping up in impressive ways to make a contribution on the frontlines. Cuba, a country of just 11 million people, has sent 165 health professionals and it plans to send nearly 300 more," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday.  The United States has pledged some 4,000 military personnel to assist with the fight against the disease in Africa, although the troops are not expected to treat people suffering from Ebola.  While help continues to pour in from around the world to West African countries reeling from the epidemic, the most basic need is doctors and nurses who can treat Ebola patients without falling ill themselves, health officials said.  "There is a lack of human resources, so it has been a major contribution," said Dr. Jose Luis Di Fabio, the WHO's representative in Havana, who is coordinating the training of the Cuban health workers.  "You have to identify patients, diagnose patients and treat patients. If you don't have the human resources to do that, you don't have anything," he said. "Human resources in Africa is the major thing that's lacking."  Nurse Carlos Garcia Hernandez is one of the Cuban health workers training to fight Ebola. He volunteered, he said, because if Ebola isn't stopped in West Africa, it will continue to spread to other countries.  "If it could show up it in developed countries like the U.S. and Spain, it can show up in undeveloped countries, too. Our families are at risk as well," he said.

Any old city can string up a few lights downtown and call it a holiday celebration.  From Mexico to Malta, northern lights to sunny skies, these places are doing Christmas better than the rest this year.  Bath, England  There are few cities in the world where you can celebrate the birth of Jesus and the birth of Jane Austen with the same amount of fanfare, but Bath happens to be one of them.  The Theatre Royal, which Austen mentions in "Northanger Abbey" and "Persuasion," is home to a musical celebration accompanied by mince pies and mulled wine in honor of the literary doyenne.  There's also a varied program of holiday drama, musicals, opera and concerts, including Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin.  A seasonal favorite, the 18-day Bath Christmas Market has over 170 wooden chalets selling distinctively British handmade crafts in a quaint Georgian setting.  Straddled between the imposing Bath Abbey and the venerable Roman Baths, the market offers a festive way to discover the character of Bath, which is the only entire city in the UK to have been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Bath on Ice is a great excuse to bundle up and lace up your skates, while the Thermae Bath Spa is the perfect reason to strip down and savor the steam emanating from the thermal mineral-rich waters of an open-air rooftop pool with spectacular views over the city.  New York  Rockefeller Center lies at the core of the New York Christmas.  Its famed ice rink has been around for 78 years; the decorated tree is an 81-year-old tradition.  Across the street, Radio City hosts the annual Christmas Spectacular, starring the Rockettes.  On the southwest corner of Central Park, Columbus Circle hosts more than 100 vendors selling clothes, gifts, snacks and drinks at the Holiday Market.  Central Park has two ponds for skating and horse-drawn carriage rides.  Fashion's biggest names join in the festivities, setting up impressive Christmas window displays.  The most glamorous cases, at the Fifth Avenue flagships and department stores like Saks and Bergdorf, are impressive enough to melt the heart of Anna Wintour.  Malta  Visiting presepju, or nativity scenes, is an integral part of Christmas in Malta.  Every year, residents proudly open their shutters, and sometimes even their garage doors, to display their holy crib confections to the public.  On a grander scale, the Bethlehem f'Ghajnsielem is a life-size nativity experience spread over 20,0000 square meters of formerly abandoned fields.  Inhabited and animated by over 150 actors comprised of entire families, the village takes visitors back in time to Judea of 2,000 years ago, complete with oil lamps, turn mills, grazing animals, crafts areas teaching traditional skills and folklore, a tavern, and of course a grotto housing baby Jesus.  Downtown Valletta is also home to a lively Christmas spirit, with carolers singing outside the Baroque St. John's Co-Cathedral during advent, and a dizzying display of Christmas lights on Republic Street.  The Manoel Theater is well known for its annual Christmas pantomimethis year Pinocchio themed.  A visit to the privately owned Museum of Toys featuring dolls, soldiers, train sets, and clockwork tin trinkets dating as far back as the 1790's, is a heartwarming homage to childhood.  Barcelona, Spain  If you can manage to extend your Christmas holiday until Three King's Day (January 5), there's no better place to catch up with Melchior, Gaspar and Balthazar than Barcelona.  On the evening of January 4, they arrive at the city's port on the Santa Eulaliatheir very own shipin bearded and velvet-robed splendor.  Canons are fired, fireworks are set off, and as the mayor hands them the keys to the city, the magic of the Magi officially commences.  They parade through the streets in a magnificent cavalcade of floats that includes camels, elephants, giraffes and dazzling costumes.  Rovaniemi, Lapland, Finland  While legends dating as far back as the 1820s cite the North Pole as the official home of Santa Claus and his jolly missus, the Finns would have us believe otherwise.  For them, Rovaniemi, Lapland, located just north of the Arctic Circle, is Christmas HQ.  Here, children make gingerbread cookies with Mrs. Claus, enroll in Elf School or take a calligraphy class and compose their Christmas wish lists with a traditional quill.  Other area attractions include the Ranua Zoo, home to baby polar bears, wolverines and moose; Sirmakko reindeer farm, where visitors can take a sled-led reindeer safari; and the Arktikum, a science center where the mystery of the northern lights is revealed.  Those in search of a truly frosty experience can stay in the Arctic Snow Hotel, made entirely of snow and ice, but equipped with saunas and hot tubs in which to thaw.  Nuremberg, Germany  The Nuremberg Christmas market (Nurnberger Christkindlesmarkt) is a German institution, pulling in more than 2 million visitors each year.  Highlights include a giant carved wooden Ferris wheel, old-fashioned carousel and steam train.  Unlike all those "fake" Christmas markets that have been popping up in the region, Nuremberg's Christmas Market Council is serious about making sure only traditional handmade toys and holiday goods are sold.  No mass-produced plastic garlands here.  The market's 200 select vendors also put up fantastic displays as they compete for the Most Beautiful Stall Design award.  The top three walk away with a gold, silver or bronze "Plum People" awards.  Adults can enjoy Nuremberg spicy gingerbread and mugs of mulled wine.  For kids, there's the Toy Museum, while the German Railway Museum is a hit with everyone.  Quebec City, Canada  If you're the type who likes to celebrate Christmas around a tree made from recycled sheet metal, with lights powered by the pedaling of nearby cyclists, Quebec is your destination.  A haven for environmentally friendly, outdoor enthusiasts, the city bustles with activity, offering holiday programs for all tastes.  Modern-day Victorians can enjoy a candlelit evening of stories from Charles Dickens, recounting the Christmas traditions of yore.  Sausage and roast chestnut lovers can browse the wares at the German Christmas market.  The more religiously inclined can wander an exposition of nativity scenes from around the world.  The nearby Sentier des Caps de Charlevoix offers family-friendly hiking, snowshoeing and skiing, while speed devils can zoom around in a snowmobile from Nord Expe.  Reykjavik, Iceland  When it comes to Christmas celebrations, Iceland has a few peculiarities.  Among these, 13 "Yuletide Lads" (scruffy Santas) are said to bring gifts to nice children for the 13 nights leading to Christmas.  Rows of small, beautiful huts make up the Yule Town Christmas market on Ingolfstorg.  Here, visitors can pick up colorful Christmas gifts, decorations and treats.  The shopping differs day to day as some craftsmen and designers set up stalls for only one day.  Beaming down onto a city covered in snow and Christmas lights, northern lights displays add to Reykjavik's festival feel.  San Miguel de Allende, Mexico  Piatas, posadas and ponche sum up the festivities in this colorful Mexican city, where Christmas is both a solemn and celebratory affair.  Leading up to December 24, you're likely to stumble upon Mary and Joseph strolling the streets, as locals make pilgrimages from home to home, singing to "ask for posada" or "beg for shelter" as they reenact the journey to Bethlehem.  Pinatas and ponche (a mulled fruit drink) cap a long evening of peregrinations around this cobblestoned city, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its wealth of grand churches, well-preserved architecture and grand zocalos.  Santa Claus, Indiana  Christmas is a year-round occasion in this town of fewer than 3,000 residents.  Santa Claus, Indiana, receives thousands of letters a year from children trying to reach St. Nick himself.  A group of volunteers called Santa's Elves was set up in the mid-1930s to reply to each letter.  The Land of Lights display is a 1.2-mile drive around the Lake Rudolph Campground & RV Resort.  Among various Christmas-themed events, Santa hosts a buffet dinner at the Christmas Lodge every Friday leading up to Christmas.  Strasbourg, France  Strasbourg's series of themed Christmas villages morph the city into a visual and gastronomic wonderland.  Visitors can head to the Village of Alsace Farmhouse to taste prune, apricot and other holiday-inspired variations of farm-fresh foie gras.  The nearby Village of Bredle is supplied with its namesake traditional Christmas biscuits and copious amounts of mulled Alsatian wine.  From the Strasbourg Philharmonic to gospel to Django Reinhardt-inspired gypsy jazz, Strasbourg's Christmas program is packed with concerts and cultural events from Croatia, the guest country of Strasbourg's Christmas celebrations this year.  Valkenburg, The Netherlands  This small town is the Dutch center for Christmas festivities.  Valkenburg's Velvet Cave is transformed into a Christmas Market and the residence of Santa, where visitors can see his room of presents and reindeer sleigh.  The cavern houses sculptures and an 18th-century chapel, as well as preserved mural drawings that date to Roman times.  Marlstone products and traditional Polish handicrafts are a few of the unique items exclusive to Valkenburg's Christmas markets.  Best way to reach the Christmas town? A Christmas Express train that runs regularly between Simpelveld and Valkenburg.  
 The deaths of a father and his two daughters, whose bodies were discovered at Fort Hood, Texas, are being investigated as a possible murder-suicide, Army officials said Wednesday.  The bodies of the 43-year-old man and the two girls, ages 9 and 4, were found in on-post housing Tuesday morning, the Army said in a statement. The three were dependents of a female soldier who recently returned from an overseas deployment, it said.  "Although a final determination has not been made and the investigation is continuing, early indications are the deaths are possibly the result of a tragic murder-suicide involving the husband and the two children," the statement said.  Autopsies are being conducted by the Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner, the Army said.  The identities of the dead have not been released pending notification of next of kin.  CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.

In the wake of a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis linked to bacteria-tainted cantaloupe, authorities assured the public that cantaloupe grown in places other than Colorado's Jensen Farms is safe.  But if in doubt about a fruit's origin, they said, it's best to throw it out.  The outbreakblamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogeneswas first reported September 12. As of Wednesday, it had grown to 72 cases in 18 states and had killed 13 people, officials with the Centers for Disease Control said. The number of cases is expected to rise, as it can take one to three weeks for a person who ingests the bacteria to show symptoms.  All of the tainted cantaloupes were grown at Jensen Farms in Granada, Colorado, although they were shipped to 17 statesIllinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.  "It's important to know that if you know the cantaloupe that you have is not Jensen Farms, then it's OK to eat," CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters during a conference call Wednesday. "But if you're in doubt, then throw it out."  The recalled cantaloupes may bear a green-and-white sticker that says, "Product of USA-Frontera Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe," or a gray, yellow and green sticker that says, "Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fords."  But not all cantaloupes may have a sticker, Frieden said. Consumers are urged to ask the supermarket or supplier if they know where the cantaloupes came from. If the cantaloupe's origins remain unconfirmed, it should be disposed of, he said.  However, the likelihood of tainted cantaloupes in the nation's food supply is decreasing, thanks to the fruit's short shelf lifeabout two weeks, officials said. The recalled cantaloupes were shipped from July 29 through September 10, "so we really are nearing the end of the shelf life of the product in addition to its recalled product," Sherri McGarry, a senior adviser with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), told reporters.  The recall itself should be removing the cantaloupes from shelves, she said, but the shelf life means the tainted cantaloupes will not be edible much longer. "But consumers do have their own practices so we need to be cognizant some folks may hold that a little bit longer than we might expect," she said.  If consumers do have a cantaloupe from Jensen Farms, authorities recommend they don't try to wash off the bacteria. "We want you to throw that product away," McGarry said.  The fruits should be disposed of in a closed plastic bag and placed in a sealed trash can, to prevent people or animals from eating them, the CDC said.  Refrigeration will not kill the Listeria bacteria, which can grow even at low temperatures, officials said. And the longer a contaminated food is stored in the refrigerator, the more opportunity the bacteria has to grow.  "It is very important that consumers clean their refrigerators and other food preparation surfaces" in order to minimize risk, the FDA says on its website. After washing refrigerators, cutting boards and countertops, the agency recommends sanitizing them with a solution of one tablespoon chlorine bleach per gallon of hot water and drying them with a paper towel or cloth that has not been previously used.  Jensen Farms has now ended its cantaloupe harvest for the season, so no new contaminated fruit will be entering the market, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said Wednesday.  Although Jensen Farms does produce other products, there is no concern for any other product from the company, McGarry said.  Listeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It rarely is a serious concern for healthy children and adults, the CDC said, but can be dangerous for older adults or those with weakened immune systems. It can be treated with antibiotics.  The source of the outbreakthe deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998remained under investigation. Officials could not give a figure Wednesday for the number of cantaloupes recalled.  
 French Prime Minister Francois Fillon unveiled further details Monday of a 26 billion-euro ($33 billion) business stimulus package which his government hopes can stall falling growth and prevent the country joining other major European economies in recession.  Up to 1,000 projects will benefit from the package, which was first proposed by President Nicolas Sarkozy in December and approved by French lawmakers last week.  Around 20 billion euros of the total amount will be spent over the next 12 months. Businesses will receive 11.4 billion euros while the same amount will be invested in public projects with social housing identified as a priority. The final 4 billion euros will be spent on improving France's transport, energy and postal service infrastructure.  The package is expected to stimulate economic growth of around 1.3 percent, Fillon said. France has so far avoided the worst of the recession that has gripped many of its western European neighbors, including Germany and the UK.  But unemployment rose by a further 45,000 in December after surging by 64,000 in November, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said Monday, adding that she would be "very surprised" if France experienced positive growth in 2009.  Speaking to CNN this weekend at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Lagarde, defended the case for public spending in the face of fears that stimulus packages amounted to storing up unmanageable debts for future generations.  "When the house is on fire we don't look at what can be built, Lagarde said. "We need to kick start (the economy) and we need to restore confidence."

An alleged terrorist leader suspected of plotting the bombing of a Philippine superferry more than four years ago, killing at least 116 people, has arrived in Manila after his arrest in Bahrain, a Philippine justice official said Saturday.  Authorities suspect Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. was behind the 2004 superferry bombing.  Authorities in Bahrain arrested Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. last month, said Ricardo Blancaflor, undersecretary at the Department of Justice. Lavilla was deported Saturday to Manila, where police arrested him and briefly paraded him in front of local media crews before locking him inside police headquarters, Blancaflor said.  Lavilla is one of the top ideologues in the Rajah Solaiman Movement, a group of former Christians who converted to Islam and claim affiliation with the al Qaeda-linked regional terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf, Blancaflor said.  Blancaflor said authorities suspect Lavilla helped plot the bombing of a superferry near Manila on February 27, 2004, in which at least 116 people died. They believe Lavilla also helped plan the bombing of a bus behind the Intercontinental Hotel in Manila on February 14, 2005, an attack that killed at least four people and came to be known as the Valentine's Day Bombing.  The bus bombing was part of a trio of attacks that happened that day. The two other blasts, both fatal, happened in the southern cities of General Santos and Davao.  Blancaflor said he suspects Lavilla was also involved in the planning of several bomb attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Manila, all of which were thwarted by Philippine police.  In describing Lavilla's arrest in Bahrain, Blancaflor said only that police there arrested him as they were enforcing U.N. Security Council resolution 1276, which imposed air travel and financial sanctions on the Taliban.  Jemaah Islamiyah aims to create a Muslim "superstate" across much of Southeast Asia. Authorities blame the group for the Bali, Indonesia nightclub bombings of 2002, which killed more than 200 mostly Western tourists.  The group is also suspected of subsequent attacks on the Australian Embassy and J.W. Marriott hotel, both in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.  The Abu Sayyaf group is one of several Islamic militant groups fighting the government in and around the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.  CNN's Rory Suchet contributed to this report.  
  Former world number one Ana Ivanovic has climbed to a year high of 26th in the rankings after breaking her WTA Tour title drought.  The Serb ended a run of two years without a winner's trophy on Sunday, defeating Patty Schnyder in straight sets in the final of the Generali Ladies Linz tournament in Austria.  Ivanovicwho was a last-minute replacement in the draw for the injured Serena Williamstook just 47 minutes to dispose of her Swiss opponent 6-1 6-2.  It was her second success at the hard-court event, with her win there in 2008 her last on the women's singles circuit.  "It's just amazing how some things turn out. This is my first title since I won here in 2008, so it's very special. I feel very good here and am really happy to have come back this week," the 2008 French Open champion told the official WTA website after claiming her ninth career title.  Since rising to the top of the world rankings in 2008, the 22-year-old has suffered a dip in form due to illness and injury that has seen her fall to as low as 65 in the world earlier this year.  But seeded seventh in Austria, Ivanovic did not drop a set all week and Schnyder was unable to provide much of a challenge to the rejuvenated champion in the final.  "I had confidence from my last few matches and that helped me stay aggressive today. I took a lot of risks and stepped in a lot," she said.  "I believed in my shots and made them count, and I'm very pleased with that."

LOS ANGELES, California He is the international superstar responsible for breathing life into the iconic comic book hero Wolverine. Her movies have earned more than $2 billion worldwide, including the entire "X-Men" franchise.  Hugh Jackman emerges as Wolverine in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," which opened Friday.  Actor Hugh Jackman and film producer Lauren Shuler Donner recently sat down for a candid conversation about their new film, "X-Men Origins: Wolverine."  Specifically, the pair talked about the scene in which Jackman's character is transformed from a simple mutant with bony claws that periodically protrude from the back of his hands to an invincible mutant filled with an indestructible metal called adamantium.  This scene represents the ultimate birth of a comic legend as the character is transformed from Logan to Wolverine.  Watch the scene in which Wolverine is unleashed   Hugh Jackman: I knew this was the birth of the character; this is where we see him in full flight. It's called in the comic book "berserker rage." It's not really in the English language, but it may be now! But, this idea that this complete animal [has been] unleashed, which is obviously the entire storythis battle between the animal and human is something we all relate to.  Lauren Shuler Donner: There were many things he had to do in the tank, you know. One of them was he had to be lowered, and then the needles had to come towards him.  Now, most of those were CGI, so he had to look in certain places where the needles were. But, he couldn't hear [director] Gavin [Hood]. So they ... tried all kinds of sounds, speakers, everything. ...  They finally devised this toe method where, if Gavin pulled on Hugh's big toe, it meant the things are coming, the second toe is this, the last toe is rise up, very sophisticated. (laughter)  Jackman: I had in my head that I've got to be in much better shapenot better shape, different shape, kind of ridiculous shape because I wanted it to be uncomfortable. I wanted it to feel like I felt when I saw Robert De Niro in "Cape Fear," thatwhoa, this guy is dangerous, he's powerful, he's dangerous, and he can snap at any point.  Donner: There's an iconic drawing of Wolverine coming out of the tank in the comics with the things popping out of him and his hair all over him in a rage, and we wanted to be that image. That's the image we wanted for the fans.  Jackman: I was a little frightened when I watched it, like, "Is that me?" [My wife] Deb was like, "Hugh, this is ridiculous. I don't even know who that is."  
 Meat grinders grinding people. Bathroom mirrors that bleed. And body partseverywhere.  Sending you screaming will be the mission of the Goretorium when it opens this week in Las Vegas.  Marketed as the only year-round horror attraction in Vegasthe first of its kindthe hotel-themed haunt is the work of Eli Roth, the actor-writer-director who has built a career on low-budget, blood-drenched horror films such as "Hostel" and its sequel.  Roth will be making a special appearance on opening night, performing an illusion that's actually pretty dangerous, CEO Robert Frey said. Roth's surprise will be only the first of the evening.  Get your kicks on Route 66  The pitch is archetypal: the Goretorium is actually "the Delmont," a '60s-era hotel whose owners make sure the guests enterand never leave.  There's a haunted elevator, a go-go lounge and a chapel, which will be open for real-world weddings.  A stew of horror tropes mixed with an eye for decade-crossing design, the Delmont has been planned down to its last detail, Frey said, including the costumes, sound design and even the slot machines featured in the lobby's casino.  The scares themselves are just as carefully planned. At any one time, there will be 35 to 40 actors at work, many of whom have previous experience in "haunt environments" such as haunted houses.  The floor plan is interactive and free-form, so attendees can choose their own path, whether that means a trip to the laundry room full of squeaky-clean human skin or a peek at the bathrooms, where the mirrors drip blood.  But even though the Goretorium has been built with a flurry of high-tech tricks, the scariest moments aren't necessarily the most advanced, Frey said. Sometimes it's the low-tech stuff that guests should watch out for.  One thing the Goretorium isn't afraid of is going stale. There are plans to add new scares often, Frey said. Tickets are $35 if purchased online.  There will be new things to run away from as early as Thanksgiving and Christmas; it should take repeat customers six or seven trips to see everything, and that's the point.  "We'll get you when you least expect it," Frey said.  TIME: Finally, booze comes to Disney

A 22-year-old man from Pakistan hopes to soon swim the English Channel with an American friendbut first he's got to navigate the currents of bureaucracy.  College teammates David Gatz (left) and Usman Javaid want to swim the English Channel for charity.  Usman Javaid, an Ohio college student who has won national swimming titles in his native Pakistan, wants to swim the channel with his best friend, David Gatz, a fellow member of the swim team at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio.  They want to honor their international friendship by working together to accomplish a great feat: a relay across the English Channel. They also hope to raise money for charity.  "With teamwork and cooperation you can tackle even the toughest of challenges," Javaid told CNN in a phone interview Wednesday from Islamabad, Pakistan.  Yet the British government has denied Javaid's request for the visa that would let him enter the country.  British authorities say they can't grant a visa because they have questions about Javaid's student status, the young man said.  "They weren't satisfied I was going to Britain for the stated purpose," he said.  Javaid said his passport contains a valid student visa for the United States and he sent documentation from the Channel Swimming Association with his visa application to prove he is scheduled to do the swim.  The United Kingdom Border Agency told CNN in a written statement that "all visa applications are considered on their individual merits, taking into account all the information provided."  "Where an applicant fails to demonstrate they meet the relevant rules, their application will be refused," the statement said.  The agency noted that anyone who is refused can reapply with additional information.  Mark Cooper, the director of marketing and communication at Ohio Wesleyan University, said British authorities have not contacted the university to ask about Javaid's student status.  "We did send ... documentation to [British authorities] to follow up" after Javaid's application was denied, he said.  Javaid has since applied to the British high commissioner in Islamabad for an emergency visa.  Meanwhile, Gatz and the university's head swim coach, Dick Hawes, are waiting in Dover, England, hoping things will work out so the men can try to accomplish their goal.  The Channel Swimming Association has granted them permission to try their crossing between July 29 and August 6, Javaid said. The association determines such "swim windows" after considering the expected tides and the schedules of pilot boats, which accompany the swimmers.  The association sent a letter Thursday to the British high commissioner in Pakistan to confirm Javaid's mission, said Joan Metcalfe, the association's chairwoman.  As the clock ticks, Gatz remains in Dover, where he passes the time by training in the channel.  "There is some frustration," he said Thursday, "but we're also optimistic."  Gatz is the captain of Ohio Wesleyan University's varsity swim team. He swam twice for the university at the NCAA national championship meet and holds numerous records.  Javaid is a gold medalist on the Pakistani national swim team and represented his country at the South Asian Federation Games.  Their coach said he's proud of the pair, no matter the outcome of their attempt.  "I think it's great. It shows so much maturity on their partfirst, to take on such a large endeavor, but it also speaks so much about their friendship," Hawes said.  Their relationship reflects the unity of the entire swim team at the school, he said.  "This is an international family," the coach said of his swimmers. "It's a phenomenal environment. This has just been such a great experience."  As they work to accomplish their goal, Gatz and Javaid also are accepting donations for Doctors Without Borders, an international medical humanitarian organization also known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres.  Gatz, who is double-majoring in biochemistry and pre-med, said the idea came as they followed news reports of Pakistan's campaign against the Taliban this year, which displaced thousands of civilians in the country's northwest.  "We wanted to donate to an organization that was helping people there," he explained.  Javaid added Thursday, "That was a big reason we chose Doctors Without Borders, because there are a lot of people suffering in that area and they are assisting them."  Some of the donations will cover costs associated with their anticipated channel swim, he added.  But even if they don't get to do their relay, Javaid said, their effort is still worthwhile.  "Even if my visa doesn't go through, we'll continue with Channeling Peace," he vowed, referring to the organization they set up for their effort.  "Even if I have to swim in a lake in Pakistan while David swims in the English Channel, it's still a powerful symbol," Javaid said.  "Symbols gather power not from the act itself but from the people who are supporting them," he said. "A lot of people around the world are supporting us and our message. As long as they support it in their hearts and minds, we have been successful."  
 New York More than 1,000 people in New Jersey and New York, many of them adolescent Orthodox Jews, have been sickened with mumps since August, health authorities said Monday.  Orange County, New York, has confirmed 494 cases since early November, county spokesman Richard Mayfield told CNN. Almost all of those infected with the virus are of the Orthodox or Hasidic Jewish population, and their average age is 14, he said.  Neighboring Rockland County has confirmed 317 cases since August, with all of the sick from the Orthodox Jewish community, said Kathleen Henry, county Deputy Commissioner of Health. Their average is 14 to 18, she said.  Just south of the two counties, in New York City, Brooklyn had 79 confirmed cases of mumps as of October 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in November. Any confirmation of other infections in the city are expected to be announced Tuesday.  The mumps outbreak began at a summer camp for Orthodox Jewish boys in Sullivan County, New York, according to the CDC. Health officials have linked the outbreak to an 11-year-old boy at the camp. He had recently returned from the United Kingdom, where a mumps outbreak had spread to 4,000 people.  The mumps outbreak also spread to Ocean County, New Jersey, where 159 confirmed cases have been diagnosed since September, county spokeswoman Leslie Terjesen told CNN. An additional 70 others are suspected of having mumps, she said.  Only seven of the infected are not Orthodox Jewish, but they all had exposure to the community, Terjesen said. The average age of the sick is 21, she said.  Lakewood, New Jersey, Rabbi Yehunda Pirutinsky was surprised when his 14-year-old son was diagnosed with mumps a week ago. Lakewood is in Ocean County.  "He was completely vaccinated," Pirutinsky said. "So it was a surprise to us he came down with mumps."  Anyone fully vaccinated from mumps receives two doses of the vaccine, according to the CDC. Of the New Jersey cases, 77 percent were vaccinated, Terjesen said.  But the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, according to the CDC. At two doses, the vaccine is 76 to 95 percent effective, the CDC says on its Web site.  In November, the CDC called the spike in mumps cases, "the largest U.S. mumps outbreak since 2006, when the United States experienced a resurgence of mumps with 6,584 reported cases." Then, only 179 people were sickened in New York and New Jersey.  Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus, according to the CDC. Initial symptoms appear 12 to 25 days after infection and include fever, headache, muscle aches and loss of appetite. Mumps can cause the jaw and cheeks to swell, with further complications including the inflammation of the brain, testicles or ovaries, and deafness, according to the CDC.  Pirutinsky's son has fully recovered from his bout with mumps, which Pirutinsky assumes he contracted while at his Jewish high school. A doctor advised the teenager to not attend school for a week and limit time with his siblings, Pirutinsky said.  The outbreak has disproportionately affected Orthodox Jewish communities, but Pirutinsky said he wasn't overly worried.  "I wouldn't say the community is alarmed, but it's something we're aware of," he said.  CNN's Edmund DeMarche, Miriam Falco and Nicole Bliman contributed to this report.

(Wired)Rafael Araujo's illustrations are bewilderingly complex - so complex that you might assume the artist uses a computer to render the exacting angles and three-dimensional illusions. And true, if you were to recreate his intricate mathematical illustrations using software, it probably wouldn't take you long at all. But the craziest part of all is that Araujo doesn't use modern technology to create his intricately drawn Calculations series - unless, of course, you count a ruler and protractor.  Read more: Mind-blowing portraits made of test tubes and pushpins  The Venezuelan artist crafts his illustrations using same skills you and I learned in our 10th grade geometry class. Only instead of stashing those homework assignments deep into the locker of his brain, Araujo uses these concepts to create his da Vinci-esque drawings. In Araujo's work, butterflies take flight amidst a web of lines and helixes, a shell is born from a conical spiral, and the mathematical complexity of nature begins to make sense.  He says perspective and angles have always come naturally to him. "When I was young I began drawing perspective almost out of the blue," he recalls. "I loved three-dimensional drawings and liked to find out ways to locate dots in the space." Before computer-assisted drawing, there were artists like M.C. Escher, who Araujo counts among his biggest influences. "When I first saw M.C. Escher, I was speechless," he says. "His artwork was so akin to my geometrical taste."  Read more: Origami - perfect blend of math and art  Working on an old drafting table, Araujo began drawing his own perspective illustrations, eyeballing the trigonometry to plot dot sequences that would allow him to create curved shapes like double helixes and cones. If you look closely at Araujo's drawings, you'll notice each of the main shapes sits within a line-drawn square or rectangle - he began adding this to his works after realizing these scaffolding boxes created a more reliable way to correctly position the dots. "There is naturally a learning curve," he says. "And as problems are solved, you become more adept and, again, daring."  As Araujo became more confident in his skills, he began adding ink-drawn butterflies, insects and shells to the canvas and painting them with acrylic in order to add visual complexity to his work. Each illustration takes him upwards of 100 hours, and that's if he doesn't mess up. "Painting is very similar to cooking," he says. "You've got to be always careful!"  Read more: These shimmering LED installations transport you to an alternate universe  Even with the added embellishments, his work is restrained and exacting. But that scientific honesty is also what makes his illustrations so visually compelling. Scientists and mathematicians often say there's a comfort in their work because they know there's always a right and wrong answer. It's the same with Araujo's art.  There's little gray area to be debated when it comes to angles and lines, and somehow that reliability and predictability translates into something beautiful. "I love Pollock, and enjoy very much casting paint onto a canvas without rules," he says. "But you've got to make it to appear, if not "beautiful," well done, and that is difficult."

 A leading football agent fined by FIFA for using social media has taken to Facebook to question the fairness of soccer's global governing body.  In December Brazilian agent Paulo Teixeira was handed a two-month suspension and a $8,600 fine by FIFA for breaching its code of professional conduct as well as its disciplinary code for a number of Facebook postings.  Teixeira has used his Training Compensation page on the website to expose what he says is the unequal relationship between Europe's leading clubs and smaller clubs in South America and Africa in the way teams from developing countries are compensated for discovering and training young talented players.  Unbowed by FIFA's sanction, Teixeira returned to Facebook on Monday to ask why the disciplinary committee that had handled his caseinvolving 215 pages in total of evidence and the decision itself, 80% in Frenchhad comprised four officials, only one of whom speaks French.  "And in came the judgesfour. A Swiss, an Irish, a Venezuelan and a Chinese. It took a full month to write the 31-pages long decision, again in French. At the end of the day, I had been suspended for two months and fined," Teixeira posted on Facebook.  "How could football executives of this caliberbosses of their respective associationshave reached such a decision without having full knowledge of the contents of the case?  "Or was is presented to them in the universaI language ... Esperanto?"  In a statement to CNN, FIFA insisted: "The members of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee were aware, took note and understood all the elements of the case, which were available and presented to them in a language they understand, in order to be in a position to take the decision."  Teixeira, who once represented former Brazil international Roberto Carlos, has been using Facebook to discuss governance issues surrounding sport, but primarily football, after being inspired by the way social media was used by revolutionaries during the Arab Spring.  "European clubs are ready to pay millions on transfer fees, but when it comes to settling training compensation to African or South Americans clubs, it becomes a problem," said Teixeira.  "Clubs know that they will have to pay once the cases reach FIFA, but until then they buy time."  His disciplinary action came after two European powerhouses, Italy's AC Milan and Anderlecht of Belgium, complained that Teixeira had defamed them in Facebook postings when he claimed the clubs failed to pay the true cost of training a player to the development team, based on FIFA's formula.  However, advocacy group changeFIFA, which seeks greater transparency within the ruling body, suggested the Teixeira case raised important questions.  "Given the serious allegations of Teixeira, it's odd that FIFA would target the person making the allegations of impropriety and not address the alleged impropriety itself," a changeFIFA spokesman told CNN.  "Any sincere search for truth by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee should involve investigating the allegations themselves and not silencing the person making them."  Teixeira is football's equivalent of a bounty hunter, taking a hefty commission from the teams he represents in cases he takes before FIFA to claim training compensation from larger clubs.  He has extensively detailed his disputes with a number of those European clubs on Facebook, and when Teixeira was suspended in December, FIFA released a statement saying "this was the first time a member of the football family has been suspended/fined for using social media."

There are tiring commutes. And then there's James Robertson's commute.  The 56-year-old Detroit man walks 21 miles every weekday as part of his journey to and from the factory where he works.  "I never thought anything I did would garner this much attention," Robertson said.  Robertson takes the bus some of the way, but for the past decade, ever since his car broke down, he has trudged the better part of a marathon each workday. Rain, snow or shine.  After reading about Robertson's commute in a Detroit Free Press article from over the weekend, college student Evan Leedy was moved. Like Robertson, the 19-year-old lives and works in two counties, so he spends a great deal of time commuting himself. But Leedy has a car.  Leedy decided to set up an online fundraiser to buy Robertson a new car.  "My first car cost $3,000," Leedy said, "So I set the goal at $5,000. Within an hour, we'd raised $2,000."  Leedy's fundraiser on GoFundMe has blown past its original goal, reaching more than $257,000 by Tuesday evening.  Robertson, in a video message posted on the Free Press website, gave thanks.  "Everybody calls me the inspiration, but to those who have been great enough to donate and everything ... it was really so welcome that I don't know what to tell you," he said. "You guys are the heroes."  Comments on the page from people donating money suggested that the story of Robertson's dedication to getting to work had tapped into a deep well of public feeling.  "Thank you for inspiring me and hopefully tons of other people to persevere in the face of adversity," said a contributor by the name of Kevin LeMelle. "You are a true American hero."  "We could use more men like James Robertson in this world," wrote a donor named Betty Blanchard.  Blake Pollack identifies with the strangers' words of support. He first spotted Robertson during his own work commute a year and a half ago.  "Climbing over snow banks, when it was pouring down rain in the summer," Pollack said, "Whatever the weather, he was there."  Pollack approached Robertson, who told the financial executive his story.  Pollack promised to give him a ride the next time he saw him.  "Two to three months later, I saw him on a corner," Pollack remembered, "And I asked if he needed a ride to work."  Pollack estimates he's given Robertson between 40 and 50 rides since then, and the two men from vastly different worlds have formed an unlikely friendship.  The pleasure, Pollack said, has been all his.  "I'm the lucky one," Pollack said. "Driving him around isn't a chore, it's a reward."  Pollack said Robertson is inspirational and funny, adding that his work ethic puts anyone to shame.  "I set our attendance standard by this man," Todd Wilson, plant manager at the engineering factory, told the newspaper. "I say, if this man can get here, walking all those miles through snow and rain, well I'll tell you, I have people in Pontiac 10 minutes away and they say they can't get herebull!"  Robertson apparently has a perfect attendance record. He earns $10.55 an hour, not enough to save up to buy, insure and operate a car in the city, according to the newspaper.  With the online donations now topping $200,000, Robertson, Pollack and Leedy met together for the first time Monday night. The overwhelming support has extended beyond moneyand several car dealerships have offered to give him a vehicle outright.  "Now that [the effort] is so big, there's so much more to think about," Leedy said.  There are, unfortunately, people who want to take advantage of Robertson's newfound celebrity and his generosity, Pollack said. He put together a team that includes an attorney from a large law firm in Michigan, a CPA and a certified financial planner that he says will ensure the donation money is handled appropriately and in a way that best serves Robertson.  "This money that is being given to himhe earned every penny of it," Leedy said, just by his work ethic and his attitude.  He's been making the arduous 21-mile journey from Detroit to Rochester Hills since his 1988 Honda Accord gave up on him.  The donations mean that Robertson's mode of transportation will likely soon be changing, and without the long commute, he'll probably be getting a lot more sleep. But he loves where he works, so he has no plans to change much else.  "I can't imagine not working," Robertson said. "It's what I've always done."  Robertson, in his message, said he never expected as much support as he has received. He encouraged people to look out for one another.  "If this story will touch at least one person and inspire them to do something out of the goodness of their heart, I will be the happiest person alive," he said.

 A Major League Baseball player was stabbed to death Monday in the Netherlands, police said.  Greg Halman, 24, was found dead just after 5 a.m. Monday in Rotterdam, a police spokeswoman said. Investigators arrested his 22-year-old brother, she said.  Halman played center field for the Seattle Mariners. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig issued a statement expressing his condolences to the team.  "The loss of a talented 24-year-old young man like Greg, amid such tragic circumstances, is painful for all of us throughout the game," Selig said.  Betra Dorrestijn, a spokeswoman for the Royal Baseball and Softball Union of the Netherlands, said Halman's family confirmed his death to the federation.  "We are shocked to hear that Gregory Halman has passed away," she said. "It is tragic that he should die at such a young age."  Halman was a federation member when he played baseball as a teenager for an amateur team in his hometown of Haarlem, just outside Amsterdam, before going to the United States to play, Dorrestijn said.  Halman made his Major League debut on September 23, 2010, and went on to play 44 games with the Seattle Mariners, Major League Baseball said. He finished the 2011 season with 20 hits, including two home runs, in 87 plate appearances, according to figures from Major League Baseball.  "I only knew Greg for a brief time, but I feel lucky that I had the chance to get to know him," Mariners Manager Eric Wedge said in a statement. "He was a fine young man with a bright future. Greg had a tremendous energy about him, both on and off the field, that I loved. This is just tragic. That's all I can think, that this is so tragic and sad."

Several terror attacks. Deadly counterterrorism raids. And a wave of suspected jihadist arrests from France to Greece to Belgium.  European Union officials are scrambling to stop the spread of terrorism and threats, with foreign ministers meeting Monday in Brussels, Belgium, to tackle the issue.  "We start with obviously a discussion on how to counter terrorism, not only in Europe but also in other parts of the world," said Federica Mogherini, EU high representative for foreign affairs.  She said she had just met with Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby "as the threat is not only the one we faced in Paris, but also spreading in many other parts of the world starting from Muslim countries.  "And we need to strengthen our way of cooperating together, first of all with Arab countries, and then internally."  With new developments sprouting up across Europe, here are the latest:   The hunt is still on for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in raids last week, Belgium's justice minister said. The suspected leader and key link between senior ISIS operatives in Syria and the Belgian terrorist cell, Belgian-Moroccan ISIS fighter Abelhamid Abaaoud, is still at large, a senior Belgian counterterrorism official said. Abaaoud's last known location was believed to be Greece, the official said.   An Algerian national who may have links to Abaaoud was arrested over the weekend in Greece and is being extradited to Belgium.   The man detained by Belgian police after last week's raid has been identified. His attorney says he isn't a terrorist; he was just delivering shoes to a friend when he was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. But investigators believe the man played a key role in the terrorist cell's plot, the Belgian counterterrorism official said.   Investigators are looking for a man whose DNA was found on a gun magazine used by Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four hostages at a kosher supermarket in Paris.   Sales of counterfeit goods by Charlie Hebdo attacker Cherif Kouachi helped fund the purchase of weapons, a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in France told CNN.  Five Belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization in connection with last week's raid in Verviers, federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said. The terror cell planned to target police officers, he said.  Belgian counterterrorism agencies think the suspected ringleader of the cell is likely Abaaoud, the senior Belgian counterterrorism official said.  According to Guy Van Vlierden, a reporter at the Belgian newspaper HLN who tracks Belgian foreign fighters in Syria for the blog "emmejihad," Abaaoud is a 27-year-old from the Molenbeek district of Brussels who traveled to Syria in January 2014 and joined ISIS soon afterward.  The two gunmen killed in the Verviers raid, Belgians of North African descent from the same Brussels district, were in phone contact with an ISIS ringleader in Greece, who Belgian authorities believe was likely Abaaoud.  But Belgian authorities have not ruled out the possibility that an Algerian suspect arrested in Greece over the weekend was the key link between the terror cell and ISIS.  That 33-year-old suspect was wanted in Belgium on charges of terrorist activity, Greek police said Monday. Belgium is requesting an extradition.  And Greece isn't done yet; police there say they have made multiple arrests and are looking for more suspects.  Other countries are also helping Belgium nab suspected jihadists.  French authorities captured two suspects as they were trying to cross from France into Italy, Van Der Sypt said.  Four days after police raided a suspected terror cell in Verviers, Belgium, killing two people who authorities said were part of a terrorist cell on the brink of a major attack, we now know the name of the surviving suspect.  Marouane El Bali was taken into custody and faces charges of participation in a terrorist organization and possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack, among other charges, said his attorney, Didier De Quvy.  But De Quvy said his client was not involved in any terrorism.  "He went to Verviers to see his fiance and was dropping off a pair of sneakers,"  De Quvy said. "He did not know that these guys were connected to international terrorism. He arrived, he sat down and, the moment he sat down, the policemen starting shooting. He managed to escape by jumping out the window. The other two, however, took their guns and responded and got killed."  Authorities say it wasn't just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Investigators believe El Bali played a key role in the terrorist cell's plot and was a key intermediary between two dead gunmen and a wider network in Brussels, the senior Belgian counterterrorism official said. El Bali is also believed to have fought with ISIS in Syria at some point.  There are still concerns that part of the terror cell remains  at large in Belgium, and could take revenge for the death of their comrades, the senior counterterrorism official said.  Belgian security services suspect around 10 people were involved in the cell, but they don't know the number for sure and that worries them.  Belgian counterterrorism officials believe the cell had ambitious attack plans beyond attacking police, given bomb-making chemicals found in their safe house in Verviers and police uniforms. They also suspect terrorists were plotting multiple attacks. The belief is that the cell has now been disrupted and will take some time to get back on its feet.  The wider cell was being monitored for less than two months. Over the last several weeks, Belgian security services started monitoring the Verviers group 24/7.  Why did police move in last week? One reason, the official said, is that the cell obtained weapons and Belgian police could not continue round-the-clock surveillance indefinitely.  Investigators say DNA found in a car used to transport Jewish market attack gunman Coulibaly has been traced to a man who is already in custody in connection with the attacks, according to a source familiar with the ongoing investigation.  Investigators are still looking for a person whose DNA was found on a magazine for Coulibaly's gun.  Coulibaly is the gunman who killed four hostages on January 9 at a kosher grocery store in Paris before police killed him. Before the siege, he had proclaimed his allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.  The assault happened during three days of terror in France that began with the attack on offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper in Paris. In all, 12 people died in the Charlie Hebdo attack on January 7.  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shootings.  On Monday, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Laurent Sourisseau will succeed editor Stephane Charbonnier, who died in the attack.  Although French officials said they thought Cherif Kouachi had given up terror-related activities and moved to end surveillance on him after he began selling counterfeit goods, it turns out the proceeds from those sales were being used to buy weapons, a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in France told CNN.  That's just one of several missteps by intelligence agencies in France being revealed by the investigation into the attacks, the source said.  Other failings include a lack of communication and delays in circulating information, according to the source.  In one case, a French surveillance agency received an alert about one of the Kouachi brothers' phones in February 2014, but it took four months for information to be passed on to the country's main domestic spy agency, the source said. By then, neither brother was under surveillance, the source said.  The surveillance on Cherif Kouachi ended in November 2013; the surveillance on Said Kouachi, the older brother, ended in June, sources have told CNN.  Also, authorities now say they think both Said and Cherif Kouachi traveled to Yemen in 2011 via Oman, even though Cherif's passport had been confiscated in 2010. However, investigators have been unable to find either brother's name in travel databases, according to the source.  CNN's Phil Black, Ivan Watson and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.  
 A familiar refrain for many football fans is that it's "the hope that kills you."  Over the last two decades for one of the world's most famous sports teams Liverpool, there's been a lot of hope extinguished as a 121-year-old football institution has failed to recapture its former dominance of English football.  Between 1973 and 1990, the English championship was placed in the trophy cabinet at the club's Anfield stadium on 11 occasions.  That domestic success was accompanied by continental glory as the European Cup was taken to Merseyside four times between 1977 and 1984.  But then came the famine.  After sealing a then record 18th English title in 1990, Liverpool has only sporadically shown signs of mounting a genuine Premier League challengeuntil this season as the club makes an unlikely bid to win the league.  Like Liverpool fans, one of their outstanding performers this season Daniel Sturridge is dreaming big.  "I think it's important that we just go out there, work as hard as we can as a team in every game and perceive what the future holds," Sturridge told CNN ahead of a key league match against Manchester United.  "We hope to have some success, we hope to be successful. There are 10 games to go so we'll see where that takes us."  During that title famine, Liverpudlians had to watch on as great rival United established itself as the preeminent force in English football.  In April last year, United beat Aston Villa 3-0 to clinch a 20th league title, meaning it stands alone as the most successful team in English soccer history.  The two teams meet on Sunday in a match which is about more than sporting pride. It's a simmering century-old rivalry, shaped by resentment between the two citiesseparated by roughly 30 milesthat has its roots in industrial history.  But for the first time in two decades, the balance has shifted in the battle for power between these two storied clubs.  United is floundering in seventh place in the table following a disastrous campaign which has so far seen manager David Moyes struggle to emulate his illustrious predecessor Alex Ferguson.  While United are struggling to even qualify for Europe's premier tournamentthe Champions LeagueLiverpool is riding high.  An exciting, vibrant team built by Northern Irish coach Brendan Rodgers sits second in the Premier League table, seven points behind leaders Chelsea but with a game in hand.  The driving force behind Liverpool's rise have been goalscorers Luis Suarez and Sturridge, who have put the team in with a serious chance of ending a 24-year wait for a 19th league title.  Uruguay's Suarez and England international Sturridge, dubbed the "SAS" by the British media, have scored 24 and 18 Premier League goals respectively, rocketing Liverpool towards the top of the table.  "SAS dynamic and dominant, but everyone contributing and effective," tweeted Liverpool's American owner John W Henry, who also owns the Boston Red Sox, after the recent 4-0 drubbing of Merseyside rivals Everton.  So with 10 games to go of the 2013-14 season, Liverpool fans are daring to hope.  The turnaround in the team's fortunes has been startling.  It finished the 2012-13 campaign in seventh position, 28 points behind table-toppers United, 12 points adrift of fourth-place Arsenal and qualification for the lucrative Champions League.  Last season Liverpool finished with 61 points, but it has 59 points so far in the 2013-14 campaign with 30 points still to play for.  Rodgers' team has already won more matches than it did in the whole of last season18 compared to 16and it's the most in-form team in the Premier League with five wins from its last six games.  The team's recent positive results have been a source of encouragement for former Liverpool stalwart Jamie Carragher, who made over 500 appearances for The Reds before calling time on his career at the end of the 2012-13 season.  The former defender is even starting to believe that Rodgers' emerging squad is capable of taking the title ahead of mega-rich powerhouses Chelsea and Manchester City.  "The way Brendan has put the team together and the way they're playing at the moment, they're the most in-form team and the best time to be in-form is towards the end of the season," Carragher told CNN.  "They've put themselves in with a great chance. You'd still have to fancy Chelsea and Manchester City slightly ahead of them, but both those teams have to play at Anfield. I think it will depend on how they do in those games."  Steve McManaman, who is a former Liverpool teammate of Carragher, has also been impressed by Rodgers' flourishing team.  "Can they win the league? Of course they can, but I still think they're two, three, four players short of having a squad to rival Manchester City and Chelsea," said McManaman, who enjoyed two Champions League triumphs with Real Madrid after joining the Spanish club from Liverpool.  "I would always plump for those teams before Liverpool. A great year for Liverpool would be to just get into the Champions League," added McManaman.  "The step from finishing seventh last year and so many points behind to winning the league is huge. If they do it, I think it would be a monumental feat, but I think Champions League football would be incredible this year."  Like Carragher, Sturridge predicts two potentially season-defining matches against Chelsea and Manchester City.  "I think they're both favorites and they're both a threat," said the 24-year-old of Liverpool's title rivals. "We're going play them both at Anfield. It's going to be a great occasion for myself and for the fans and my teammates of course.  "But it's important that we go out there and play the Liverpool way and enjoy it."  If Sturridge and Suarez can fire in those two games, Liverpool could well end 24 years of hurt and give its fans renewed hope that the club can return to its former glories.

For two years, Google has pushed its Google+ as more than a social network or cool video-chatting tool. This week, it is working to hammer home that point with a spate of new features.  Google+ isn't an answer to Facebook or Twitter, Google says. It's the connective tissue that more and more is tying Google's most popular products togetherand it will not be ignored.  Since it debuted in June 2011, Google+ has seeped into all other parts of the Google ecosystem, tying into other Google offerings like search, Gmail and YouTube. Sometimes the product feels like an invasive species, especially when using it is required to benefit from the coolest features in other Google products.  "I'm not sure that it's forced. I think there are some people who may have a misunderstanding of what we're trying to accomplish," said Vic Gundotra, the Google senior vice president who leads Google+.  Creating one unified Google identity for each user is the primary purpose of Google+. When the project was started, the company was trying to solve the problem of disconnected online identities.  "One of the core insights we had when we started Google+ was that Google itself was deeply fragmented," said Gundotra. "Google treated identity as something that was fragmented and different, when (people) were on YouTube they had one identity, when they were on Android they had a different identity, when they were on Gmail they were someone else, when they used search they weren't even logged in."  But the reality is that many people still have multiple online identities and Gmail addresses. There might be one for work, another for personal, and a dedicated e-mail address for signing up for services and e-mail lists to collect all the resulting spam in one convenient bucket. Instead of giving those up and using one Google identity, many people choose to juggle their accounts.  To get people to use Google+ the way Google imagines it, the company is working to make the benefits of using one primary Google identity too good to ignore.  During Wednesday's Google I/O developer's conference keynote address, Google+ played a big part in many of the more exciting product announcements, even though it wasn't always called out. The redesigned version of Google Maps will recommend restaurants based on what your Google+ friends have reviewed and visited. The new Google Music All Access service will also use your social graph to hone in on music you might enjoy.  "That unification of Google, of bringing Google together, makes for amazing things," said Gundotra.  One feature demonstrated on stage was a voice search for a person's recent vacation photos. If you are logged into Google Search under the same e-mail you use for Google+, and if you also use Google+ to upload and share your personal photos, you can get these types of customized search results.  Those tie-ins could play a more important role in getting people to embrace, not just grudgingly accept, Google+ than the service's stand-alone features. However, a lot is being done to improve the stand-alone Google+ experience.  On Wednesday, Google unveiled a sleek new redesign, some very impressive photo tools, and a feature that automatically combs posts on the social network and adds appropriate hashtags. In an impressive Googley twist, it can even identify what's in a photograph to add hashtags like "concert" or "cat."  When there is breaking news, like the Boston bombing, people will refer to it with different terms and finding out more information requires you to leave Google+. That's in stark contrast to Twitter, current king of breaking news, where hashtags and discovery tools make it easy to stay on top of important events in real time.  "You've got to figure out how to canonicalize that 'bombing in boston,' 'disaster boston,' 'marathon disaster,' are all the same thing. And you have to bring all of that together and then say, this is the recommended tag. And if you click on it, we understand the related entities. That's a deep understanding of the knowledge graph. In real time, as its happening," said Gundotra  In addition to trying to clean up user identities and make Google+ a more engaging experience, Google+ is also unifying existing Google products that overlap. The new Hangouts messenger service allows people to chat via text, share photos, and talk over video with one or multiple people, between phones, tablets and desktops. Instead of separate products for Video Hangouts, Google Talk and Google Messenger, there is just one tool.  This new product could take on existing chat platforms like WhatsApp and BlackBerryMessenger, though Gundotra said that wasn't its main goal.  "Obviously, we knew that there were real time communications products. We're not going to tell you we didn't know that there were these products out there. We were watching the growth of them and that was powerful data for us, that there was a need out there for a better solution," said Gundotra.  "Frankly we were looking at our own problems, and our customers were telling us, Google: Unify these things" Gundotra said.  
 So, you're leaving your job.  Maybe you're finally going to start that Kafka-themed coffee shop/art space/bowling alley you keep talking about. Or maybe this is the year your indie Latin jazz rock band will finally make it big.  Perhaps you freaked out on some hapless JetBlue airline passenger and are gonna be grounded for a bit. Or maybedrag, dudethe employment gods decided that you (along with 131,000 workers in July alone) are gonna have a liiitle extra free time to enjoy the end of summer.  Either way, when it comes time to kiss your cubicle goodbye, you can scamper away, firmly ensconced in your Own Little World like a gerbil in a clear plastic ball, or you can tie up digital loose ends and depart with dignity. We recommend the latter.  First things first: You need to tell the world--and especially your officemates--that you're leaving. It's tempting to walk out of that awkward meeting with your boss, the sight of her crumpled frustration and disappointment at losing one of her best employees (right) still fresh in your mind, and tap out the tweet or Facebook status update you've been dreaming about for years: "F*** YEAH, I'M OUTTA THAT HELLHOLE!"  A classier step: Tell the important people (the ones who'd want to hear it from the horse's mouth) in person or via personalized calls or e-mails, then compose a Facebook status asking your friends and colleagues to celebrate with you at a local watering hole. Post it on your wall and let the congrats roll in.  A mass e-mail to relatives and networking contacts is fine, toojust keep it brief, say nothing but classy things about your former employer, and be prepared to write a battery of "Thanks, yeah, I'm excited!" responses when your e-mail hits peeps' inboxes. (If your exit was less, er, voluntary, the same principles apply: "celebratory" drinks become "commiseration" cocktails, and the mass e-mail becomes more of a polite plea for networking leads.)  After you've gotten woefully drunk with friends and colleagues, it comes time to bid your co-workers adieu. Yeah, you have 4 million things to think about after you give (or are given) your two weeks' notice (like how to steal as many office supplies as possible before the final punch-out). But saying your goodbyes, handing out your contact information and digitally setting up a few easy streams of continued connection mean you won't turn into that "Hey, whatever happened to that guy?" guy.  So do not go gentle into that good night. You already know to write your boss a handwritten card (even though up to 40 percent of men want to punch their bosses in the face, according to a lovely new survey from Mint.com and AskMen.com), right? But how to handle the rest of the herd?  Definitely walk around and shake hands with everyone you can on your last day. (You may wish to avoid interrupting everyone's menial-labor stupor to let them know you're heading out, but do it anyway. The murmurs of "That bee-yotch didn't even say goodbye" are ultimately much more damaging).  In addition, in most offices it's cool to send a mass e-mail (to the entire staff, if you worked with everyone, or at least to everyone who knows who you are) as your very last missive from your soon-to-be-defunct work e-mail address. Thank them all for being wonderful and encourage them to keep in touch.  Finishing on a warm note makes it that much more likely that they'll think of you when a new position's open and you're miserably toiling away at your new jobyou know, instead of just recalling the time you came to work early to print out the 200-page application for "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?" and broke the printer.  Also in said e-mail, provide your personal e-mail address and phone number as a separate vCard, (no, not that kinda V-card, interneteurelectronic business cards.) Instructions vary by e-mail client, but usually involve making a new contact for yourself and forwarding that out from your address book. Then recipients can just open up your e-business card to permanently have all your info.  You can also exchange info via apps like Bump, which allows you to trade contacts, pictures, etc and connect via social networks by tapping your phones together. And now that PayPal has integrated Bump, you can finally get all that poker money back from Joe in finance.  Lastly, don't let your onetime colleagues forget you. We're not suggesting an epic, last-day, one-man show involving blowhorns and a mariachi band. Or an email to the entire office gleefully revealing how your FarmVille-playing boss wiled away his daysas in the viral hit from earlier this week which, sadly,turned out to be a hoax. (Although that would be a pretty epic note on which to leave).  Rather, our point is: Most people don't burn bridges, but they do let them rot. So keep the bridge strong (to continue the hoary clich) by sending occasional check-in e-mails and, if appropriate, following colleagues on Twitter in the hope they'll follow you back.  That way they pretty much can't forget you, as your smart retweets and interesting links will flick you into their consciousness a few times a day.  Just don't drunk-tweet about how your five-month dry spell is making you wonder why you went back on the pill in the first place.   2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

South Korea on Wednesday announced sanctions against Iranincluding government scrutiny of most financial transactions involving the countryas part of global efforts to quash Tehran's suspected nuclear program.  A key Iranian bank also will face "a heavy penalty," said South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Kim Young-sun, according to state media.  The Seoul branch of Iran's Bank Mellat has allegedly facilitated hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions for Iranian nuclear, missile and defense agencies, the Yonhap news agency said.  Korea also will expand a sanctions blacklist to limit the foreign-exchange transactions of more than 100 people and Iranian entities; step up inspections of suspicious cargo to and from Iran; put those blacklisted on a travel ban; and limit investments in Iran's gas and oil refinery industries.  The blacklisted entities include Bank Mellat, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, according to Yonhap.  The United States, a key South Korean ally, has lobbied other nations to step up sanctions against Iran. The European Union, Canada and Japan are among those that have done so.  Iran is continuing its uranium enrichment activities in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a report released Monday by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Iran has rebuffed international demands to halt its uranium enrichment program, saying it wants the nuclear fuel for peaceful uses. The IAEA is not convinced.  In low concentrations, enriched uranium can be used to fuel civilian power plants, but in extremely high concentrations, it can be used to produce a nuclear bomb.  "Based on an overall analysis undertaken by the agency of all the information available to it, the agency remains concerned about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed nuclear-related activities involving military-related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile," the IAEA report said.  Last month, the United States extended sanctions against Iran, saying it was targeting a number of Iranian businesses and groups accused of helping organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Taliban.  In June, the United Nations imposed some of its toughest sanctions yet of Iran. The new sanctions include cargo inspections, new controls on Iranian banks, restrictions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a new U.N. panel of experts to help monitor and enforce sanctions, and asset freezes on 40 entities and individuals.  Also in June, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions targeting the country's nuclear and missile programs, identifying more than 20 companies and several individuals allegedly involved with those programs.  
 Four people, including a 12-year-old, died when an Amtrak train hit their car in Hardeeville, South Carolina, an official said Tuesday.  The accident occurred Monday night near the South Carolina-Georgia state line, not far from the intersection of South Carolina 46 and U.S. 17.  "It appears that the vehicle tried to go around the gate arms ... to beat the train across the tracks," said Ted Felder, Hardeeville's interim city manager.  The Jasper County, South Carolina, coroner has not released the names of the dead.  The car became wedged onto the front of the southbound train, which pushed it for a mile down the track, Felder said. The Hardeeville Fire Department  received a call shortly before 9 p.m. ET Monday, but teams from various agencies reportedly were unable to detach the car until about midnight.  Felder said no one on the train was injured, and once the car was detached, a bus took passengers to the Amtrak station in Savannah, Georgia.  The train was en route from Charleston, South Carolina, to Savannah when the crash occurred.

A magnitude 5.1 earthquake hit Puerto Rico on Friday, rattling residents but causing no immediate reports of damage.  The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, which occurred at 7:43 p.m. (6:43 p.m. ET), stuck about 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of San Juan. It was some 64 miles deep, the USGS said.  There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.  A Federal Aviation Administration official said the international airport in San Juan was open and operating normally.  "It lasted about 30 seconds and felt hard. Some guests did get a little scared," said Venus Nevarez, an employee at the El San Juan Hotel and Casino. She said nothing broke and that all the guests were fine.  
 Lingering oil residue at the bottom of Gulf Coast marshes caused heart defects and hindered reproduction in a small fish seen as an environmental bellwether, researchers said Thursday.  The Gulf killifish spends its whole life in the marshes of the Gulf Coast, with few in their lifetimes venturing more than a football field's length from where they were born. Because of that, they've been the subject of several studies since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill erupted off Louisiana in April 2010.  The latest, conducted by scientists from Louisiana State University and University of California-Davis, found killifish embryos that were exposed to oiled sediments hatched at a rate 40% lower than those cultivated in samples from un-oiled sites. Those that did hatch were smaller, had lower heart rates and had cardiovascular deformities that were likely to hurt their chances of survival, said Ben Dubansky, an environmental toxicologist at Louisiana State University.  "Early life exposure affects heart function, and these abnormalities persist until adulthood and make it harder for fish to survive, evade predators and eat," Dubansky said.  The findings were published online this week in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Science and Technology. Co-author Andrew Whitehead said the killifish is the "canary in the coal mine" for the Gulf Coast, where scientists are still trying to catalog the effects of the 2012 disaster.  "They're the most abundant fish in these marshes," said Whitehead, a genome biologist at UC-Davis. "They're a really important forage speciesthat means a lot of the fish that we care about commercially eat them. They're really important as that sort of middleman member of the community ... Their biology is going to reflect the quality of their local environment."  Because the oil spread across the Gulf in patches, Whitehead said it's still too early to tell what the findings mean for killifish populations overall. The study this week isn't a direct sign that the numbers are shrinking, but it's a warning, he said.  "Any animals that share a similar habitat to our killifish are going to be at similar risk to this species, and there are lots of commercial species that we care about that share the same habitat," he said.  In earlier studies, scientists observed deformities in the gills of killifish. In this study, Whitehead said, "We brought the field into the lab" by collecting water and sediment samples from areas that had gotten hit by oil during the spill, introducing embryonic killifish and comparing the results to fish cultivated in samples from un-oiled sites.  "What we found were pretty clear and dramatic and pretty obvious development differences in the embryos exposed to the oiled sediments," he said.  Killifish are typically a few inches long and commonly used as bait. There's no sign that the oil components are accumulating in their meat, but the fish are suffering "massive biological effects" as their systems process the compounds, said LSU environmental toxicologist Fernando Galvez, another collaborator on the study.  Researchers are still trying to assess the damage the spill did to the Gulf Coast, but fishermen in some parts of Louisiana say the catch has yet to recover from the spill. Oil company BP, which owned the ruptured well and is responsible for the cleanup, announced plans for nearly $600 million in restoration projects in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana this week.  The new research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative, the BP-funded effort to study the environmental impact of the Gulf spill.  BP said in a statement Friday that while the company had not had a chance to review the data in the new study, "it is important to note that there are many sources of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or compounds in the oil that settled into the sediments) and other stressors that elicit the biological effects described in the killifish paper. These sources have existed for years in Louisiana marshes, and not all are associated with oil."  BP says the spill has cost it more than $32 billion to date, including cleanup costs, compensation and penalties. It's currently in a federal court in New Orleans, seeking to avoid a finding of gross negligence that could result in another $17-plus billion in fines under the Clean Water Act.

New York Technology and globalization are putting the jobs of millions in America's middle class at risk, says analyst Fareed Zakaria.  In a cover story for Time called "How to Restore the American Dream," Zakaria writes, "We have just gone through the worst recession since the Great Depression. The light at the end of the tunnel is dim at best. Sixteen months into the recovery, the unemployment rate is higher than it was in the depths of all but one of the postwar recessions. ...  "Americans are far more apprehensive than usual, and their worries seem to go beyond the short-term debate over stimulus vs. deficit reduction," according to Zakaria. "They fear that we are in the midst of not a cyclical downturn but a structural shift, one that poses huge new challenges to the average American job, pressures the average American wage and endangers the average American Dream."  The author and host of CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS" spoke to CNN on Friday. Here is an edited transcript:  CNN: You wrote in your Time cover story that the American middle class is being "hollowed out." What does that mean?  Fareed Zakaria: Well, if you think about it, middle class to most Americans means somebody who has a good high school education, somebody who didn't go to fancy schools or grow up in a fancy suburb, but somebody who is working on a factory floor as a foreman, or a manager, or maybe in sales or administration.  What's happened to these people is that these jobs have a certain kind of routine nature to them. What technology has done over the last 10 or 15 years, it's become possible to do many of these tasks through computer programs. Now computer programs need to be monitored and supervised, but it takes far fewer people to do that ... and the people supervising computers need to be more high-end, more skilled people.  CNN: How does that work out in practice?  Zakaria: Take the example [former GE CEO] Jack Welch gave. He said information technology been around since the 1980s and 1990s, when it was mostly streamlining back offices. Now it's transformed every department from sales to marketing to administration. You used to just use computers to streamline, for example, the payroll system. Now it's completely ubiquitous, affecting every aspect of business.  Read Zakaria's "How to Restore the American Dream"  Welch gave the example of a company he's involved in buying. It had $12 billion in revenue in 2007 with 26,000 employees. With the greater efficiency that comes with technology, the same company, when it returns to that level of revenue in a few years, will have only 14,000 employees. That's roughly half the people generating the same revenue. That's the basic dilemmacompanies have gotten so efficient, and there's enormous pressure on these simple routine tasks that used to employ lots of people.  CNN: Is globalization of companies also a factor in hollowing out the middle class?  Zakaria: Clearly, the second big part of this is globalization. Most big American companies are now global companies. The world market has tripled or quadrupled over the last 20 years, as the number of potential consumers greatly increased once the Soviet system collapsed, and China and India liberalized their economies. It's added as many as a billion and half consumers to the world market. Companies have benefited enormously from it, but these new consumers are willing to work for much less. That's a huge factor, you can't deny it.  Technology may be a bigger driver than trade, but globalization is easier to understandwhen you have an autoworker in Mexico willing to work for $7 an hour versus $28 an hour in the U.S. The best way to think of it is that technology and globalization are working together to produce these results.  CNN: You give the example of a radically cheaper car that is being produced in India? Why is that important?  Zakaria: It's called the Nano. It costs a little more than $2,000 in India and when it's sold in the U.S., it will cost about $7,000 once it has safety features such as air bags and meets U.S. crash requirements. It's a good car. This is a perfectly nice car, looks a lot like Mercedes' Smart Car, except that the Smart Car costs $22,000.  The most important thing may be the partsevery part in that car costs a fraction, as little as 1/16, of what it costs to manufacture in the United States. So where will the U.S. car companies get their parts made if they're trying to be competitive? They will be tempted to buy those parts manufactured in India.  You can't even call it outsourcing since these are global companies with global supply chains. They will invest more in their Chinese operation, or their Brazilian operation, and less in the U.S. operation. They will be doing what they need to do to survive in a competitive global market.  CNN: So what can be done?  Zakaria: We are going to have to move up the value chain. Ultimately you don't want to be making products that people can make somewhere else in the world at half or a quarter of the price.  You have to take on the more complex aspects of manufacturing. The car is becoming two things, it's a manufactured product, but it's also a very highly sophisticated computer. Think of your GPS system, audio system and so on. Each of these components has to be coordinated. Can we make the high-end aspects of the car? Can the U.S. be dominant in design, in the computer electronics part of it. It's very tough to be competitive on the pure manufacturing of the chassis.  CNN: What's the impact on people?  Zakaria: They have to hone their skills so they are really good at this stuff, at the skills of complex manufacturing and electronics. I don't mean to say everyone has to become a brain surgeon, but there's a difference between skilled labor and highly skilled labor. The Germans have maintained their manufacturing base because they've concentrated on complex manufacturing. They don't try to make Toyota cars; they make BMWs.  That means a lot of education and retraining. And the most important thing is education. You can only retrain somebody who knows how to read and write and do math. To the extent that U.S. schools are failing at this, there is a basic problem.  You can't retrain somebody who has a fourth-grade reading level, and when they don't have any basic math in the first place. We've gone from having the best test scores 25 years ago to having the worst in the industrialized world today. That's probably the single most important problem.  
 ATLANTA, Georgia Long before U2 and Bono blazed their own paths, and decades before the Christian music industry became a half-billion-dollar annual business, a hippie musician with long blond locks paved the way.  Larry Norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex and Jesussometimes in the same song.  Larry Norman was a Christian rock musician before the genre existed, combining faith with a backbeat and social consciousness.  Think of him as rock music's street preacher, often referred to as "the father of Christian rock."  "Between 1969 and 1979, Larry Norman was the Christian rock scene's answer to Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Mick Jagger," said Emmy-nominated director David Di Sabatino, who takes a critical look at Norman's career and life in his documentary "Fallen Angel: The Outlaw Larry Norman."  "He set the standard. He created the space for others to exist. ... The vision he created for where Christian rock music could go still resonates today."  The documentary is scheduled to go into limited theatrical release in early 2010.  Norman hit the U.S. music scene at a turbulent time for the nation. His first solo album, "Upon This Rock," came out in late 1969, after he left the band People! The San Francisco Bay area psychedelic group was fresh off the success of a Top 20 hit with a cover of the Zombies' "I Love You."  It was a time when college campuses were erupting in anti-Vietnam War protests and the nation was still trying to digest what had just happened that summer at Woodstock.  As many Americans looked for answers, Norman offered his faith, a bold decision for an unknown solo artist making his major-label debut.  "It was a pretty gutsy move to sing about Jesus on his first record," younger brother Charles Norman said. "To take a chance on mentioning Jesus on a secular record was a pretty important step."  " 'Upon This Rock' was written to stand outside the Christian culture," Larry Norman said in an interview with CCM magazine. "My songs weren't written for Christians. ... I was saying, 'I'm going to present the Gospel, and I'm not going to say it like you want. This album is not for you.' "  No small surprise, given that rock music at the time was the soundtrack of the counterculture and was far from the mainstream.  A national survey conducted by Louis Harris and Associates in 1966 found that rock 'n' roll was by far the most unpopular music in the country. About 45 percent of adults said they disliked it, with only about 5 percent saying it was their favorite.  Compare that with today, when nearly two-thirds of those asked in a recent Pew Resource Center poll said they listen to it.  Being a rocker in the late 1960s wasn't just flying in the face of a conservative Christian music industry but mainstream America as well.  Then there were the lyrics, especially on Norman's second solo effort, 1972's "Only Visiting This Planet." There were no happy songs about going to heaven; the tunes tackled the social issues of the day.  Norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex, venereal disease and Jesussometimes in the same songgetting his music banned from Christian bookstores that might have sold it.  "Stuff like that shocked uptight Christians," Charles Norman said in an NPR interview shortly after his brother's death in February 2008 at age 60. "One of his songs, it's called 'Why Don't You Look Into Jesus,' one of the lines is: 'You've got gonorrhea on Valentine's Day [VD] and you're still looking for the perfect lay. ... Why don't you look into Jesus? He's got the answer.'"  The album also contained what became Larry Norman's signature song, "Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music."  Nearly two decades after its release, "Only Visiting This Planet," helmed by Beatles' producer George Martin, was recognized as a seminal recording for the genre, voted by CCM magazine in 1990 as the greatest Christian album ever recorded.  A similar list released in 2001 by CCM, a Christian music and lifestyle magazine, put the album at No. 2 all time. U2's "The Joshua Tree" was sixth.  Norman was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame that same year, along with Elvis Presley.  The accolades came much sooner in the mainstream media. In 1971, Billboard Magazine called Norman "the most important writer since Paul Simon," while Time magazine pegged him as "probably the top solo artist in the field."  Norman's fans include U2, Guns N' Roses and Bob Dylan, according to his brother Charles. John Mellencamp said he's one, too.  British pop star Cliff Richard made no secret of his admiration.  "When I first became a Christian, I hunted around in vain to find Christian rock 'n' roll music I could relate to. It just all sounded horrible," Richard said on "Rockspell," a Gospel-music-themed BBC television show he hosted in 1986, and on which Norman appeared.  Then he was introduced to Norman's music, "and I just was overjoyed and thrilled, because suddenly I could relate ... and there seemed to be a Christian who could do it as well, if not better, than the rest of us."  Black Francis of the alternative rock group the Pixies said Norman has been a lifelong influence.  "I listened to his records growing up, and saw him perform many times. In fact, I used to dress up like him; long blond hair with bangs, sort of a grown-out British invasion look, with black jacket, black shirt, black pants and two-tone black and white cheerleader shoes," Francis said.  "While Larry is always referenced by his Christian beliefs, to me he was always an entertainer ... humorous, poignant and always rock 'n' roll. His respect for the arena of entertainment is what gave him his power as a performer."  More than 300 versions of Norman's songs have been recorded by other artists, including non-Gospel acts as diverse as Richard and Francis, as well as Sammy Davis Jr., Petula Clark and Tennessee Ernie Ford.  Christian music has come a long way in the 40 years since Norman pioneered Christian rock.  "Before Larry Norman, there was not any Christian music industry," said Shawn McSpadden, manager for Switchfoot and the Grammy Award-winning band Third Day.  But today is a different story, according to figures from the Gospel Music Association. It says 56 million units of Christian/Gospel music sold in 2008, totaling nearly $500 million.  "The Christian music industry has been very business-savvy, probably without even realizing it, in that a lot of the artists and bands use their local church as their home base when they begin their careers," said Bruce Burch of the University of Georgia's Music Business School. "They immediately have fans that are passionate and devout not only about them as a band or artist, but to their message."  Album sales for the genre, during 2008, outsold classical, jazz, new age and Latin, according to Nielsen SoundScan.  Norman, a hippie musician who set out to sing about his faith, blazed the trail for Christian rock.

The Syrian government is ready to send envoys to Moscow for talks with representatives of the opposition it has been fighting in a brutal civil war for over 3 years, according to state-run media.  The government of President Bashar Al-Assad wants to find a way out of the conflict in the country, state-news agency SANA said Saturday.  But moderate opposition groups say they have not been invited to the talks by Russia and will not participate, according to Oubai Shahbandar with the Syrian National Coalition, the main opposition group recognized by the United States, the United Nations and Russia.  He said Moscow invited only loyalists groups that are close to the Syrian regime.  The meeting is expected to take place after January 20 in Moscow and will be "informal," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said earlier this week, according to Russian state news agency Itar-Tass.  "Negotiators have been named; they are the foreign minister and the first deputy ... but it is up to Syria's authorities to decide on the format for the delegation to be sent for Moscow's consultative meeting," the spokesman said.  The Syrian National Coalition says any meaningful talks must be held on the basis of the Geneva communique that was agreed upon by the United States, United Nations and Russia.  Negotiations in Geneva, brokered by the United Nations, fell apart in February. At the time, U.N. mediator Lakhdar Brahimi apologized to the Syrian people, saying he was "very, very sorry" that, despite two rounds of talks, "we haven't done very much."  Since then, the extremist group ISIS has become a growing force in northern Syria and al Qaeda-linked Al Nusra Front has made gains, weakening more moderate opposition groups.

 As Sony Pictures struggles to recover from one blow after another related to the devastating cyber attack, one may overlook the fact that its parent company in Japan has been a popular target of hackers for years.  Three years ago, in April 2011, Sony's PlayStation network was shut down for nearly a month when hackers stole the personal information of an estimated 77 million people.  That same year, in June, hackers released 150,000 Sony Pictures records including usernames and passwords and claimed to have compromised the private information of more than one million people.  In October 2012, hacker group "The Three Musketeers" released a security key that allowed PS3 users to run pirated games.  Despite those incidents, a group with suspected ties to North Korea calling itself "Guardians of Peace" was able to infiltrate Sony's computer system, steal an incredible amount of data, and use it to launch the most vicious cyber-attack in history on an American corporation.  Former Sony employees are suing the company for failing to protect their privacy. Many are asking what lessonsif anySony learned from those previous hacks.  Asia Strategist Keith Henry says Sony was taken by complete surprise last month when the cyber-terrorists successfully stole massive amounts of data and used it to devastate the company.  "They can inflict damage. Immense amount of damage to corporate America," Henry says.  They posted personal information like addresses and social security numbers, private emails that contained embarrassing revelations about top executives and Hollywood stars, insider information about the studio's tactics, and they even posted five Sony movies on file-sharing websites.  Tokyo-based cyber security firm LAC is the only line of defense for about 850 clients. It has a confidential list of private companies and government agencies.  "The hackers are always getting more advanced," says LAC Chief Technology Officer Itsuro Nishimoto.  And they are sometimes too far ahead of those trying to keep up. Nishimoto says a devastating hack like the one on Sony Pictures can penetrate even the best cyber-defense. He says the Sony network may be more vulnerable because of the large amount of users with varying degrees of access.  Sony appears to be trying to avoid further provoking North Korea, the prime hacking suspect, telling CNN simply "the investigation is ongoing."  The Japanese government is also distancing itself. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tells CNN the hack is a "United States issue."  Henry says the world is coming to terms with the new reality of cyber-terrorism.  "One of the reasons nobody is willing to make a statement is because they don't know what to say," Henry says.  Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo says the attack reveals lax cyber-security among Sony's ranks. But he suspects it is a more widespread problem in Japan.  "I think this is a wake-up call for Japan that this is a problem. This is a huge vulnerability. And they're not really managing this risk very well or very aggressively," Kingston said. "It does suggest a certain level of corporate complacency."  Defector: North Korea has vast hacker network  5 lessons from the Sony hack

A 41-year-old elephant named Patience charged and killed a Springfield, Missouri, zookeeper who had come to feed her Friday.  John Phillip Bradford, 62, died in the elephant enclosure at Dickerson Park Zoo, according to Springfield Police Department spokeswoman Lisa Cox. He was the manager of elephants, and had worked at the zoo for 30 years, according to a zoo statement.  Bradford was in the enclosure with two other workers when Patience charged him. The other two workers were unharmed, Cox said.  What set off the incident is unclear.  The zoo referred questions to the city.  "This is very sad day for the Zoo family, as well as our community as a whole," zoo director Mike Crocker said in a written statement.  The elephant has been at the zoo since 1990. The zoo hasn't had any previous problems with its elephants, Cox said.  The zoo's elephant matriarch, Connie, died last week, according to the zoo website.  The zoo opened as normal Friday, but the elephant exhibit was closed.  
 Dropping to his knees before the 10 cardinals of the Inquisition, dressed in the white shirt of penitence, Galileo Galilei was forced to retract his "heretic" theory that the Earth moved around the Sun. Threatened with torture and interrogated for 18 days, the scientist, who was imprisoned in the 17th century, promised to never again teach the theory and spent the rest of his life under house arrest in his small farmhouse outside of Florence.  Galileo's fate was very different from that of other scientists at the time of the Inquisition. Some were executed for threatening the church's teachings. Italian astronomer Giordano Bruno, an Italian philosopher who argued that the universe was infinite, was burned at the stake.  Now in 2013, as Pope Francis settles into his new role as leader of the Catholic Church, the Vatican's head of science is urging a re-think of the "mischaracterization" of the relationship between the church and science.  The Vatican would like the world to see how much this relationship has changed.  With the new pope being himself a trained scientistFrancis graduated as a chemical technician before moving on to study philosophy, psychology and theologythe timing could be right for a new era of cooperation between the Vatican and science, building on the work of the STOQ ProjectScience, Theology and the Ontological Questwhich was created by Pope John Paul II in 2003.  Since his election as pontiff, Vatican-watchers have been searching for signals about the direction in which Francis will take the church. Even in his inaugural speech, he referenced the importance of environmental stewardship and an appreciation of the natural world:  "Let us be "protectors" of creation, protectors of God's plan inscribed in nature, protectors of one another and of the environment."  According to Oxford University theologian Dr. William Carroll, Pope Francis' remarks suggest he may be planning to use his papacy to refocus the world's attention on tackling global warming and other environmental issues.  Pope to Vatican: 'Act decisively' on sex abuse cases  Embracing science  Monsignor Tomasz Trafny, the Director of the Vatican's Science and Faith Foundation, which was created last year, thinks that the new pope will continue the progress already made in building ties with the scientific community. He says the Vatican today has a very positive relationship with science.  "There was a time when theologians thought they understood everything, but we learned the lesson from history", he told CNN.  Acknowledging that the Galileo era was a dark period for the church, Trafny says that the modern-day Vatican is much more careful not to tread on the toes of science.  "If you look at what is going on today you will see that theologians are very careful about what they are thinking or speaking about related to scientific issues."  Trafny will co-host a conference focusing on adult stem cell therapies with the pharmaceutical company NeoStem at the Vatican on April 11, a project which the Vatican has partly funded.  This unusual marriage of church and biotech is a targeted public affairs initiative. The Vatican aims to use the partnership to show people there is an alternative to embryonic stem cell research - which it vehemently opposes - that doesn't involve the destruction of human embryos.  "We want to tell people that they can easily feel like good Catholics without any embarrassing situations or difficulties embracing science."  Taboos remain  But even some within the Vatican's own scientific community have concerns about the the church's firm stance on other matters. As well as embryonic stem cell research, the church, for instance, still rejects contraception, which is seen to interfere with God's will.  Dr. Werner Arber, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and a Nobel Prize-winning genetic scientist, says in some areas the Vatican's approach remains problematic. He works as an adviser to the Vatican on matters of scientific development and regularly provides recommendations on areas of overlap between science and faith.  Speaking to CNN, Arber said that rather than dealing head on with conflicts between science and the Bible, scientists like him often had to avoid them:  "I don't propose certain topics which I consider taboo. Unless we are asked, we had better not mention them."  In particular, Arber is uncomfortable with the Vatican's insistence that condoms aren't the right way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, which he says is "unrealistic." The church maintains that condoms promote promiscuity. Both the World Health Organization and the United Nations regard condoms as highly effective at preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which kills over a million people globally every year.  Arber euphemistically says he's hopeful that the new Pope Francis will help the church "move things forward" when it comes to tackling HIV/AIDS.  Sticking points  Jeremy Webb, editor-in-chief of New Scientist magazine, also hopes the Catholic Church under Pope Francis will make an exception to its stance on condom use to fight the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.  He says the speed at which new developments are emerging in the biological sciences is increasingly bringing about conflicts with the Vatican. In particular Webb sees this in relation to reproductive technologiessuch as in vitro fertilization (IVF), and egg and sperm donationall of which the church says are improper methods of procreation.  "The church is taking its viewpoint from 2,000-year-old teachings and trying to apply them to a modern world, which is delivering all sorts of moral dilemmas," he said to CNN.  Webb doubts there will be any significant change in the Vatican's fundamental attitude to contraception under Francis and believes this will remain a sticking point between the biological sciences and the church.  "Catholics believe that anything that threatens the sanctity of life - including contraception - is wrong. That is a barrier and it will always be a barrier."  There have been no signals yet as to whether Pope Francis will bring about a softening of the Vatican's stance on issues such as condom-use as means to prevent suffering and early death.  Werner Arber is optimistic that the Vatican will eventually catch up with the scientific evidence: "I have hope but - as with Galileoit will take a long time."

At Timothy Busfield and Melissa Gilbert's Wednesday wedding, the bride wore red.  Strapless red, to be exact.  The former "Little House on the Prairie" actress tied the knot with "thirtysomething's" Busfield in a private ceremony, Gilbert's rep told CNN. The couple held the joyous occasion at San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara.  According to People, Gilbert, 48, and Busfield, 55, got engaged over the holidays.  Another source whispered to E! News that Busfield and Gilbert have known each other "for quite some time, as their paths have crossed off-and-on over the past 20 years."  This is the third marriage for both newlyweds. Busfield has three children from prior relationships, whereas Gilbert's a mom of two.  CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.  
 Washington President Barack Obama is vowing to act on his own due to House inaction on immigration reform that proponents say could help address a wave of undocumented kids crossing the border from Mexico. But there are limits to the power of his pen.  Yes, the President can send National Guard troops to the border as some House Republicans insisted at recent congressional hearing on immigration.  No, the administration can't put immigrant kids "on a bus like we normally do and send them back down to Guatemala," as Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers suggested.  The children have arrived in droves after fleeing violence and poverty in Central America and are seeking "permisos" or a pass to stay in America.  Thousands are being held in detention facilities as the Obama administration tries to figure out what to do.  And while Obama promises "a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress," Speaker John Boehner and other House Republicans criticize him for being "intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems."  Boehner has said he intends to sue Obama over how he's used his executive authority to bypass Congress.  Beyond the political back-and-forth, there are some things Obama can and cannot do by way of executive action on immigration.  What he can do  1. He can tweak and fine tune existing guidelines on who to prioritize and prosecute in deportation hearings.  2. Obama can dispatch more border patrol agents as well as members of the National Guard.  3. And Obama could opt to continue a program for some who were brought to the United States as kids. It is important to note that this program allows them to temporarily stay in the country and work or attend school. It is not a path to legalization.  4. The President could also continue a practice in some states of using ankle bracelets or weekly mandatory check-ins with immigration officials as an alternative to detention.  5. And he could move to increase the amount of free legal assistance to immigrants in deportation hearings.  "If the transfer of resources involves moving judges down to that area so they can process the caseload and more asylum officers to conduct interviews with these children then we're in a zero-sum game," said Kamal Essaheb, a policy attorney National Immigration Law Center. "Those resources are being taken away from other areas. We would welcome Congress appropriating more money so everyone can get their day in court and a quick day in court."  What he can't do  1. The president can't bar people from applying for political asylum. Those guidelines are set by the United Nations Refugee Convention, which the United States has signed, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration attorney and professor at Cornell University Law School.  2. And no, the President can't increase the number eligible for green cards because their spouses or parents are U.S. citizens. Such matters are set by law. Though some immigration advocates have argued spouses and children shouldn't count toward 140,000 limit on employment-based green cards, whether the President can make that kind of change unilaterally is murky territory.  3. Obama also can't just eliminate judicial review for people ordered deported  such a move would violate the Constitution.  4. Nor can he just load up all undocumented immigrants on a bus and deport them without some sort of legal hearing. That type of action also would violate the law.  "The Constitution says that all persons have due process rights in the U.S. whether they are from another country or the U.S.," Yale-Loehr said.  5. And, for those hoping for (or fearing) a blanket executive action legalizing all undocumented immigrants, no the President can't do that either. There's a law for that.  "There are constitutional limits on what the president can do. We have a tripartite government system. The Congress enacts the laws; the President implements the laws," Yale-Loehr said. "The President cannot create an immigration policy willy-nilly, whole cloth. He cannot create an immigration law. He has to get Congress' approval to change an immigration law.

The latest problems with the IRS witch hunt, the seizure of phone records from The Associated Press, the conflicting Benghazi stories and disastrous attempts to enforce Obamacare may all seem unrelated, but they are not.  Each of these events is the direct byproduct of two central philosophies of the Obama administrationthe massive expansion of the size and power of the federal government and a lack of trust in the American people.  These scandals were bound to happen. In fact, it was inevitable, and there will be more. President Obama has grown the size, the scope, the debt and the power of the federal government to such irresponsible proportions that problems like these are an inevitable result.  Lord Acton famously noted that "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."  In a pathetic attempt to defend President Obama, another noted statesman, David Axelrod, said that the president couldn't possibly know about all these scandals because "the government is so vast." Therein lies the problem. The government is so vast.  Just a few years ago, President Clinton assured us that the era of big government was over. He could not have been more wrong. Now we have not just big government, but big brother running big government.  We don't know what the president knew of these matters before they became public, and it strains credulity to suggest that his top political advisers were in the dark. But again, when you grow government this big, these kinds of scandals are inevitable, and he bears the responsibility for that.  Are these scandals the byproduct of liberalism or incompetence? I'd say the answer to that question is yes, both.  The Obama presidency, and liberalism in general, are based on not trusting the American peoplea belief that big government is better for people. The latest scandals show why liberalism and big government don't work.  The scandals cut at the core ideology of the Obama presidency. Indeed, these issues aren't just the failure of an individual, but the failure of a system in which liberals put too much trust in big government.  Look at liberalism across every issue, from healthcare to energy to spending, and one thing is crystal clear: Liberals don't believe in the dynamic and transformative power of freedom. Bigger government and more power in the hands of a few means the interests of the public will be violated.  Many are wondering aloud if these scandals will tarnish Obama's legacy or weaken his presidency or cause his popularity to drop. Some of that will probably occur, but it's not the ever-charming Obama who will suffer the most from these scandals. No, fortunately the biggest loser here will be the paternalistic big government liberalism that Obama has foisted upon us.  We need leaders who have more confidence in the American people, and more skepticism for big government. Maybe we can get Clinton to pronounce the second end of the era of big government? It's time for Big Brother to be put down.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gov. Bobby Jindal.  
 "Matchmaker" isn't a job that appears on Claudette Breve's rsum, but she's been responsible for more than 100 successful wedding proposals. Part-time actor Rudy Rasmussen spends much of his leisure time on stages across New Orleans. Catch him performing and you'll note that he's fit and trim, despite making dozens of dinner reservations every day.  In less than a minute, either of them can spew a list of ideas to fill a travel itinerary focused on romance, family, business or Southern culture, including directions, prices, operating hours, weather conditions and insider tips. Walk up to their desk at the Ritz-Carlton New Orleans, and it's like meeting Google in human form.  Defining the job  "Concierge" is a French term that evolved from the phrase "comte des cierges," or "keeper of the candles." It dates to medieval times, when both candles and keys were required at night to open the doors of a castle and cater to the needs of visiting nobles. Nowadays, the concierge is also the keeper of cufflinks, toothpaste, chargers, combs and hair gel.  "Whether on business or leisure travel, no one wants to spend too much time trying to coordinate, plan, organize, et cetera," said Jeanne Mills, president of the U.S. branch of Les Clefs d'Or (The Gold Keys), an international organization of professional concierges with more than 3,000 members worldwide. Members of Les Clefs d'Or are seasoned pros with proven track records of making the mundane memorable.  Mills has been a concierge in Las Vegas for 23 years and is currently the chief concierge at the MGM Grand.  "My favorite part of the job is the reward that comes with playing an instrumental part of so many special moments in people's lives. Guests I took care of more than a decade ago have never forgotten me," she says.  "We're approachable, and we're not snobs!" That's the message Rasmussen would like guests to know. He makes every effort to overcome misconceptions about the job, such as the belief that the main purpose of a concierge is to make reservations and hand out maps. Those essential services are only the tip of the iceberg.  The concierge "to-do" list is ever-changing, and Rasmussen thrives on the revolving roles. One day, he's getting stale bread from the kitchen so visiting kids can feed the ducks at City Park, and the next he's helping facilitate the freezing and shipping of breast milk for a traveling mother on her first post-maternity-leave business trip.  All major resorts and five-star hotels provide concierge services to their guests. Many boutique hotels also offer the services, often on a smaller scale.  Mills says advanced technology is bringing more savvy travelers to the concierge desk. She believes that access to so much information online actually makes the demand for a concierge even greater. "Guests are seeking the guidance of concierges now, more than ever, to help them filter the barrage of information and to seek personal insight."  "Never hesitate to go to your concierge, even if you think your request is impossible," said Breve, who has been making the impossible possible for more than 25 years, primarily as senior concierge at the Ritz-Carlton on Canal Street.  She says she feels honored to be an ambassador not only for the hotel but for the city of New Orleansand she has no fear of being replaced by an Internet search engine. "Does a computer have a personality and charm or hands-on experience? I'd say no. Can a computer get you courtside seats for playoffs or a front-row seat at a sold-out concert? That's the difference between a computer and a concierge."  Even so, many frequent travelers say they have never ventured to the concierge desk. What keeps them away? Here are a few myths debunked.  Myth No. 1: A hefty tip is required.  Reality: Tipping is at your discretion.  There is no set fee for using a concierge. However, as with so many jobs in the hospitality industry, gratitude is certainly appreciated. Cash tips are appropriate, especially if you are asking for more than directions or help with an easy dinner reservation.  Les Clefs d'Or maintains that while gratuity for great service is customary, it's never expected. If you do tip, placing cash in an envelope or handing a tip to a concierge during a departing handshake is appropriate. A verbal "thank you" as you're passing the desk is meaningful, as is a handwritten note or a post-trip e-mail.  Jeff Brooks, a New Jersey-based financial consultant, says most of his business travel details are worked out in-house, but he'll never forget the concierge who helped him skate off thin ice one February.  "I was in New York City without a dinner reservation on Valentine's Day," says Brooks. The hotel concierge came to the rescue, securing a table at a very nice restaurant, resulting in a memorable romantic evening. Brooks tipped the concierge $20.  That's in line with recommendations from hotel guru Glenn Haussman of Hotelinteractive.com, who says special requests merit a tip of at least $10 or $20, depending on time spent.  "If the concierge is getting you something that would be otherwise impossible, then you are looking at a tip of $50 or more," Haussman said.  Consider your own timing as well. "If you want to get their attention, it's always a good idea to tip the concierge at the start of a trip. Ten dollars to say 'I appreciate you looking out for me while I am here' will go a long way."  Myth No. 2: They are primarily meant to serve elite clientele.  Reality: The concierge desk is a perk available to all hotel guests.  Fashion stylist Cathie Arquilla often travels for business, but she's always been wary of using a concierge. "I'm actually sort of intimidated by them. I figure they're for big businessmen on an expense account who want something fast and reliable, a sure bet where money is no object."  Arquilla is the perfect example of a savvy traveler who's packing a flawed perception.  It's true that celebrities have been known to keep a concierge or two busy. One high profile guest at the Ritz-Carlton New Orleans called ahead to request that all the furniture in his room be set up so that he was always facing east, whenever sitting or lying down.  "I don't know if it was feng shui or if it was just a personal proclivity. It took a little bit of work, but we got it together," Rasmussen said.  Breve once chased down a pet psychic for a celebrity guest whose dog was feeling down.  "If it's not illegal or immoral, we'll do it," Rasmussen said.  One of Breve's most memorable non-celebrity requests came to her at 11 a.m. on a busy Saturday. A man wanted to propose in the French Quarter at 1 p.m. In two hours, she found a stunning location, made the arrangements and found a photographer. Passers-by thought they were filming a scene from a movie.  Having ready answers for day-to-day demands is also critical for concierge success. On most days, Breve says, she answers the question, "How do I take the streetcar?" more than 100 times. And Rasmussen finds himself constantly explaining the difference between Cajun and Creole cuisine.  Myth No. 3: Only overnight guests currently at the hotel can ask for help.  Reality: They serve anyone visiting the hotel for any reason, and hotel guests can start the process upon booking.  Many people assume the concierge desk is available only once you've arrived at your destination. Not true! Rasmussen says he does his best work when clients call or e-mail ahead of time. More time to work on your agenda means you're likely to get your preferred picks.  Hotel concierges also cater to people visiting their properties for special events, such as business conferences or weddings. Maybe you've checked in elsewhere but you're a bridesmaid who somehow forgot to pack your shoes, which were dyed to match your dress. That's when it's time to call on the concierge.  The bottom line  Part travel agent, part magician, the concierge is dedicated to defining details and supplying travel joy. In medieval times, they may have held the candles and the keys, but the modern-day concierge is an expert at guarding items even more precious: guest sanity and satisfaction.

Authorities warned of high temperatures and strong winds Sunday as hundreds of firefighters battle a northern Colorado blaze that has destroyed almost 200 homes.  A warning is in effect until 8 p.m. local time, fire officials said, with temperatures expected to be in the 90s and wind gusts of up to 50 mph.  The High Park Fire is west of Fort Collins, and has burned more than 55,000 acres so far. It is about 45% contained. More than 1,600 firefighters were battling the blaze.  It has destroyed at least 181 homes, according to a statement posted on InciWeb, a U.S. multiagency fire response website.  "The assessment is still under way and this number will continue to grow," the statement said.  The blaze has moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. It has claimed one life, a 62-year-old woman found dead in her burned home last week.  "It will be some time before this fire is out, but our challenge now is to make sure we do everything to contain the damage," said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who oversees the Forest Service.  Vilsack toured the Colorado blaze and said it is one of thousands burning nationwide. The National Weather Service has issued warnings of high chances of wildfire activity in nine states, including Colorado.  Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said a tree struck by lightning about a week ago sparked the mammoth blaze in his state.  Elsewhere in Colorado, firefighters are battling an 11,600-acre fire near Pagosa Springs that broke out last month. That blaze is 30% contained.  Meanwhile Sunday, a new fire broke out and quickly spread to 200 acres near Pueblo, forcing some evacuations of residents.  In New Mexico, the Whitewater Baldy complex has scorched more than 290,000 acres, the agriculture secretary said.  Hundreds of firefighters from across the United States are helping local departments battle the blaze. Inciweb reports 303 personnel on site. The blaze was 75% contained as of Sunday.  CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.  
 WASHINGTON John McCain's campaign will stop advertising on several Web sites that have vilified Barack Obama as unpatriotic and, in one case, compared the Democratic nominee-in-waiting to Adolf Hitler.  John McCain's campaign says it's getting its ads off Web sites that vilify Barack Obama.  A spokesman for McCain said Monday the campaign was not aware its ads were running on the pro-Hillary Clinton sites. He said the campaign has taken steps to block those sites from its online advertising network.  "When we find stuff like this, we take care of it," said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers.  McCain has made it known he is reaching out to former Clinton supporters, and there are nearly two hundred well-trafficked blogs and online communities run by former Clinton supporters who refuse to support Obama. But the three sites on which McCain's ads appeared are particularly hostile to the Illinois senator.  One Web site, called Stop-Obama.org, is a group blog written by disaffected Clinton supporters, some of whom are now supporting McCain. A banner ad featuring McCain standing side-by-side with Joe Lieberman was running on the site until Monday.  A recent post on the blog outlined the "simple parallels" between Obama and Hitler, and accused Obama's audiences of having the same cult mentality that characterized followers of the German dictator.  McCain's ads have also shown up on a pro-Clinton Web site named "Obama WTF" that accuses Obama of being "spineless," having "communist influences," "courting Jew haters" and being "in the pocket of America haters."  SavagePolitics.com, another anti-Obama site that has run McCain ads, has called Obama a "bold faced liar, a thief, a sexist and a racist."  The McCain campaign pulled the ads after being notified by CNN.  Rogers said the campaign often has no control over where their ads show up on the Web. That's because the campaign uses a third-party vendorin this case, Googleto distribute their banner ads across a broad array of political Web sites by searching for certain key words.  When the campaign is made aware of ads appearing on offensive or irrelevant Web sites, Rogers said, they notify the ad distributor and have the sites added to a list of blocked URLs. He noted the McCain campaign has already blocked "tens of thousands" of such sites.  It's not the first time Web ads have placed a campaign on the defensive.  Mitt Romney's campaign found itself in the politically awkward position of advertising on the Web site Gay.com in late 2007, prompting the Web site to pull the ad shortly after it was discovered.  Last September, Barack Obama's campaign removed a campaign advertisement that appeared on the Amazon.com page for the controversial book "The Israel Lobby," which asserts that a network of influential pro-Israel activists hold undue sway over U.S. foreign policy.  CNN's Abbi Tatton and Eric Weisbrod contributed to this report.

Chicana author Sandra Cisneros is perhaps best-known for her 1984 coming of age novel, "The House on Mango Street," a story about a young Latina who leaves behind her barrio for a chance at a better life. The novel, also released in Spanish, has sold more than 4 million copies and is a considered a classic of Chicano literature.  But not everyone is a fan, specifically the Tucson Unified School District in Arizona, which banned Cisneros' book in its suspension of its Mexican-American studies program. It still bewilders Cisneros and her fans: How can a character who spends most of her time at the library and shares her experiences with her mother and blind aunt offend a school district?  Cisneros is on a national book tour this month for "Have You Seen Marie?" a tale about a woman's search for a cat who goes missing in the wake of her mother's death. It's a fable for grieving grown-ups, and at less than 100 pages, she hopes the book will be medicine for hearts broken from loss.  California-based artist Ester Hernandez, known for her depiction of Latina and Chicana women through prints and pastels, represented the unique and colorful characters, all based on Cisneros' neighbors. They make up the quirky King William district of San Antonio, Texas, where the story is based.  Cisneros tell us what inspired the tale, why she is planning a move to Mexico and how she feels about her famous book being banned.  CNN: What inspired you to write "Have You Seen Marie?"  Cisneros: I was working on the 25th anniversary tour of "The House on Mango Street." I wanted to make a small book that people could have or give to someone in a place of grief. My mother had just passed, but I still felt the need to create something. My friend and artist of the book, Ester Hernandez, had just lost her mother too, and I proposed that she join me, and she very reluctantly joined the project.  CNN: What do you want your readers to take away after reading this book?  Cisneros: I hope that they understand that when they are in a time of grief, there is something to be gained during the time, even though we tend to focus on what we've lost. But when you have your heart broken wide, you are also open to things of beauty as well as things of sadness. Once people are not here physically, the spiritual remains, we still connect, we can communicate, we can give and receive love and forgiveness. There is love after someone dies.  CNN: Were you surprised to hear that "The House on Mango Street" was the list of banned books in Arizona? Have you ever considered yourself a controversial writer?  Cisneros: Gosh, no! I don't think they read the books. They just eliminated the entire whole Mexican-American studies without thinking. It should be called American studies, and all the books should be re-introduced. Then there would be less of an uproar. The fact that there is a hyphen there tells you a lot about our times. And our whole relationship with Mexico, which has always been very controversial, especially now.  CNN: There has been talk about you wanting to improve your Spanish; is that true? And por qu?  Cisneros: What's always a challenge for me is that my Spanish is not the level of my English. Nor do I read in Spanish the way I read in English. I want my Spanish to be like that of a newscaster. ... That's a different kind of Spanish. I feel comfortable in Spanish, I chat like a parrot, but I don't have the confidence in Spanish that I do in English. I'm perfectly fine in the mercado, and I can make people laugh and tell a story, but my vocabulary is limited. For example, I don't know the Spanish word for "contractor."  But I'm going to Mexico to live for a year! This is the first time I'm going to live there. I just need to be in an environment where all I hear is Spanish.  CNN: There's a lot of debate of whether or not knowing Spanish makes you a "less Latino." How do you feel about that?  Cisneros: It doesn't make you less. You are just missing out on one of your senses if you don't have the language. It's like not having any taste buds. You are missing out on the pleasure of Latino food. The more you speak more languages, the more you understand about yourself.  It's like being blind. You aren't less of a person, but you're missing out on wonderful things.  CNN: Finally, what you are reading right now?  Cisneros: I'm read essays, poetry, fiction, art books and more all at the same time! On my various bookshelves in my home are: "The Five Acts of Diego Leon: A Novel" by Alex Espinoza; "The Distance Between Us" by Reyna Grande and "What You See in the Dark" by Manuel Munoz; "I (Heart) Babylon, Tenochtitlan and Ysteli" by Richard Villegas Jr.; "Slow Lightning" by Eduardo Corral and "Looking for The Gulf Motel" by Richard Blanco. And I just finished Marie Arana's "American Chica: Two Worlds, One Childhood."  Is that a lot?  
 Believe it or not, it has been almost a year since the birth of Prince George Alexander Louis, the son of Britain's Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, the former Kate Middleton. The baby is third in line to the British throne, behind his father and his grandfather, Prince Charles.  Ahead of his first birthday on July 22, three new photos are being released by the UK's Press Association. One, showing the smallest royal dressed in blue and taking a step, was released on Saturday.  The Press Association promises two more pictures Monday.  Here are five interesting things you might not know about the royal tyke.  1. Baby George had a low-key birth, relatively speaking.  As the Duchess of Cambridge went into labor, Prince William drove her to the hospital in an unmarked minivanwith minimal security and without a royal entouragefrom Kensington Palace to the back entrance of Saint Mary's Hospital. Even more down-to-earth? The announcement of Prince George's birth first came through e-mail and Twitter. It was truly a digital moment, according to CNN's Max Foster, who reported live from the hospital that day. The duchess, with Prince William present, delivered the baby boy at 4:24 p.m. He weighed 8 pounds and 6 ounces. The couple later announced he would be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.  Prince William's first interview as a dad  What's in a royal name?  2. His early days were not spent at the royal palace.  Despite the tradition that royal newborns spend their first days inside palace walls, Prince George spent his at the duchess' family home in the village of Bucklebury. The decision was reportedly met with protest from the highest ranks in the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II. Though there was a colossal security presence outside the home, inside it remained just the family. Kate's mother, Carole Middleton, took on the all-important role of royal nanny while her father, Michael, became the royal photographer. But the intimate family setting did not last longPrince William was back to work with the Royal Air Force by August 15.  3. Prince George has a special connection with Princess Diana.  Prince George's christening was held on October 23 at the Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace. That location was no coincidence; it was where the body of Prince William's mother, Princess Diana, lay at rest in the days leading up to her funeral in 1997. The event also set the stage for the epic portrait of Queen Elizabeth and her three direct heirs, Princes Charles, William and George. It was the first time a reigning Queen and three generations of heirs were photographed together in more than 100 years.  4. He has a supernanny.  While Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are busy with royal obligations, Prince George is cared for by what some would call a supernanny. Spanish-born Maria Teresa Turrion Borallo was trained at the prestigious and selective Norland College in England, which specializes in training nannies. There she learned everything from basic child care to defensive driving and even self-defense. This nanny not only has to handle diaper changes, she also has to worry about potential kidnap attempts and invasive paparazzi.  5. In his first year, he's embarked on an international tour and made quite the fashion statement.  Prince George has had a lot of firsts this year, and many of them were in the public eye. The royal baby tagged along in April with his mom and dad on their first family trip abroad in New Zealand and Australia. The 9-month-old followed in the footsteps of his father, who was the first heir to be brought along on a royal trip at such a young age when his own parents toured Australia and New Zealand in 1983.  After his overseas adventures, the public saw Prince George once again on Father's Day. But instead of the spotlight shining on his doting dad it was once again on baby George, who took his first steps in public, carefully holding on to his mom for balance. Not only that, the overalls he was wearing immediately sold out worldwide.  Three pivotal pictures from the royal tour

(OPRAH.com)For more than 20 years, actress Christina Applegate has kept audiences laughing.  "It doesn't feel the same, and it's hard to carry your purse," Christina Applegate says. "I cry at least once a day."  During her teenage years, she lit up the small screen as Kelly Bundy on the hit sitcom "Married with Children." After 11 hilarious seasons, Christina's career branched out to the big screen and Broadway.  In 2007, Christina landed the starring role on "Samantha Who?" an acclaimed comedy series. After receiving Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for her performance, it seemed that nothing could stop Christina's triumphant return to TV.  Then, in April 2008, shocking news silenced the laughter. At 36 years old, Christina was diagnosed with breast cancer. At first, Christina says she lived quietly with the disease. "It's hard to live quietly," she says. "I went through five weeks of work without telling anyone that this was going on in my life."  Now, Christina is going public with her personal battle to raise awareness among young women who may not think they're at risk.  As the daughter of a breast cancer survivor, Christina says she's been vigilant about getting regular mammograms since she was 30 years old. In 2007, doctors recommended extra precautions.  "My doctor said that the mammograms weren't enough for me because of the denseness of my breasts," she says. "He suggested that I get an MRI."  Christina went in for her first MRI screening, which produced disturbing results. "They found some funky things going on [in one breast]," she says. Doctors told her they needed to perform a biopsy. Then, the excruciating waiting game began.  Christina continued to work and promote her sitcom, but the impending results were never far from her mind. A week later she says she got the phone call every woman dreads. "[The doctor said], 'It came back positive,'" she says. "Right now I'm sitting here shaking remembering that moment."  Doctors explained that the cancer was only in her left breast, and thankfully, they caught it at an early stage. Christina says she held back her tears and immediately went into survival mode.  The day after her diagnosis, Christina says she went in to see an oncologist and a surgeon. "I'm a Sagittarius," she says. "We need things done now. So, for me, I had to get in now, and I wanted to have my surgery now."  Within a week, Christina had her first lumpectomy. Doctors also did a biopsy of her lymph nodes to make sure the cancer hadn't spread. Since the cancer was caught early on, Christina was told she'd need six weeks of radiation instead of chemotherapy.  Then, she received more life-changing news. A test for the BRCA genealso known as the "breast cancer gene"came back positive.  Oprah.com: Should you get tested for the gene?  "That sort of changed everything for me," she says. "Radiation was something temporary, and it wasn't addressing the issue of this coming back or the chance of it coming back in my left breast. I sort of had to kind of weigh all my options at that point."  Christina was given two options... go forward with the radiation treatments and continue testing for the rest of her life or have both breasts removed.  Christina made the dramatic decision to have a bilateral mastectomy. "It came on really fast. It was one of those things that I woke up and it felt so right," she says. "It just seemed like, 'I don't want to have to deal with this again. I don't want to keep putting that stuff in my body. I just want to be done with this.' & I was just going to let them go."  Before she went in for her surgery, Christina says she staged her firstand lastnude photo shoot. "I made sure that I have close-up photographs of them from every angle so I can kind of remember them," she says.  Christina's tears finally spilled over the day she met her surgeon. "I met with my doctor, and I told him that was my decision," she says. "He brought the surgeon in, and it was like it was the floodgates just opened up and I lost it." Oprah.com: Going through a double mastectomy surgery  In July 2008, Christina went through with the surgery, which has left physical and emotional scars. "It can be very painful," she says. "It's also a part of you that's gone, so you go through a grieving process and a mourning process."  Before she went under the knife, Christina says the only mastectomy she'd ever seen was the one her mother received. "[Her surgery] was in the '70s, and they didn't do a very good job back then," she says. "So in my own mind I'm thinking, 'My God, I'm going to be butchered, and it's going to be horrible. I'm never going to love that part of me again.' & But I did a lot of research, and they can make some pretty boobies."  Currently, Christina says she has saline expanders in her body, which will make way for the new implants. Though she's proud of her proactive decision, she says she's reminded of her loss every day.  "It doesn't feel the same, and it's hard to carry your purse," she says. "I cry at least once a day about it because it's hard to overlook it when you're standing there in the mirror. When you look down, it's the first thing you see... So you're reminded constantly of this thingthis cancer thing that you had."  On the bright side, Christina says she won't have to wear a bra ever again. She also feels victorious in the fight against breast cancer. "I have taken a very progressive stance in the rest of my life," she says. "For that, I'm really grateful."  Days after her diagnosis, Christina says she reached out to family and friends, including Melissa Etheridge, a Grammy winner and breast cancer survivor. Melissa shared the lessons she learned during the fight for her own life.  "The first thing she said to me is: 'Christina, this is a blessing that's happened to you in your life. Right now, you get to start over, and right now you get to change everythingthe way that you deal with things in life, the way that you react to things. Fear can hurt you. Stress can hurt you. This is the time that you have this opportunity to change the way you eat... everything you do,'" Christina says.  Christina now looks at her health scare as a blessing. "I am a 36-year-old person with breast cancer, and not many people know that that happens to women my age or women in their 20s," she says. "This is my opportunity now to go out and fight as hard as I can for early detection."  As she's learned, early detection may not come from a mammogram. Christina says she will fight for women to have access to MRIs and genetic testing, which many insurance companies won't pay for.  Christina says her health scare has shifted her priorities completely. "[There's] this need and this desire to make every single day count," she says. "I used to say...  'Don't sweat the small stuffnot even the big stuff.' At the end of the day, none of it matters but your own joy, your own spiritual journey that you go on, God, your loved ones, your friends, your animals. These are the things you've got to cherish and love and embrace."

 A U.S. Marine sergeant jailed in Mexico since late March for crossing the border with several guns in his car said Friday that he had walked across the border on foot and stayed at a Tijuana hotel earlier on the day of his arrest.  Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, who also said he attempted suicide while being abused by his Mexican jailers, has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border, his vehicle carrying firearms he said he legally owns but are unlawful to bring into Mexico.  "I stayed in a hotel earlier in the day," Tahmooressi said Friday in an interview with CNN's "New Day."  "I parked my truck at a parking lot on the American side ... and I walk into Mexico with a backpack with extra clothes and hygiene supplies, passport, wallet. And I decide to go hang out in Mexico for some good Mexican food, inexpensive place to stay and to hang out."  Asked about Mexican media reports that he had crossed the border into Mexico several times before his March 31 arrest, Tahmooressi told CNN in a telephone interview from La Mesa penitentiary in Tijuana that he had previously traveled there four times "just to hang out."  He denied crossing the border with the intent of trafficking arms. He had an AR-15 rifle, a .45-caliber pistol and a 12-gauge pump shotgun in his truck.  "I know what they're going to say," Tahmooressi said of Mexican authorities. "They're going to say a whole bunch of lies. They're already saying a whole bunch of lies. I just know that the truth will set me free."  Source: New hearing set for U.S. Marine held in Mexican prison  An Afghanistan war veteran, Tahmooressi, 25, had recently moved to Southern California to get treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, according to his family.  Tahmooressi described a suicide attempt with a shattered light bulb after being punched, slapped, cursed at, deprived of water and food, and shackled to a bed with a four-point restraint in a Mexican prison.  "I had one hand above my head, not both, just one," he told CNN. "I was laying on a bed. ... When I got the opportunity, I decided to stab myself in the neck with a light bulb ... I was paranoid. I had been abused. I was thinking they were going to come and abuse me more and torture me and get information about my family from me. So I said, 'I'm not going to allow them to do that.' "  U.S. Marine tells of abuse in Mexican prison, but says he's still hopeful  Tahmooressi said conditions improved after media coverage of his plight. Mexican prison authorities have denied the abuse allegations.  "I would like everyone to know that I'm an innocent man and that it was just a big mistake and that I had no intention of bringing weapons into Mexico or committing any crime at all," he said. "Unfortunately, I wasn't treated right at the border and my rights were violated."  His mother, Jill Tahmooressi, last week said her son's next court hearing is weeks away.  She has said her son immediately disclosed to the border guards that he had weapons and requested that he be allowed to turn around.  A 911 tape released by U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, appears to support the Marine's version of events.  In it, the Marine is heard saying, "I crossed the border by accident, and I have three guns in my truck, and they're trying to take my guns from me."  After learning he was in Mexico, the 911 dispatcher responded: "There's nothing I can help you with then, sir. I do apologize. You're not on American soil anymore."  Tahmooressi asked whether authorities have a right to take his guns.  The dispatcher said he should have seen large warning signs on the freeway saying it's illegal to enter Mexico with guns.  "There are warning signs that do say that as you're driving down the freeway, before you enter Mexico," she said.  "Yeah, I was hoping there would be a turnaround point," he responded, "but there never was."  His mother has said Tahmooressi was searching for permanent housing and often stayed in San Diego hotels.  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN last month that he had spoken with Mexican authorities about the veteran's case.  Tahmooressi's family and friends also pressed their case in a White House petition that had more than 122,000 signaturesabove the mark needed to garner an official government response.  "I don't know what they're going to do to help me," he said. "If they do help me, it's probably just going to be behind the scenes and the public isn't going to know about it."

	 'A U.S. Marine sergeant jailed in Mexico since late March for crossing'
When a massive, muscle-bound American football player announced this weekend that he is gay, we watched yet another brick crumble in the monolith of American prejudice. To some, Michael Sam's words might have come as a shock, but most Americans know the country is in the midst of a fundamental social shift, one that conjures images of a different place.  Where? Well, if you traveled from the United States to the Netherlands a few years ago, what you sawand smelledin the streets of ultra-liberal Amsterdam probably shocked you. Young people smoking joints in an open-air caf, gay couples holding hands on the streets and people of all ages not batting an eye about any of it gave U.S. visitors a novel and exotic experience.  Back then, the United States and the Netherlands stood on opposite sides of the front line of the social wars. Not anymore. It's not because the Netherlands has changed. It is the United States, the American people, who have changed.  The transformation in U.S. public opinion, increasingly reflected in legislation, has narrowed what was an enormous gap between the two countries. Change is coming at such a fast, accelerating rate that one wonders, is America turning into the Netherlands?  I will save you the trouble of answering. No, but there is no denying there is a visible convergence on key issues.  As a frequent visitor to the Netherlands for many years, I can tell you that the disbelieving questions I used to face about America's puritanism have become much less frequent. (Others, mostly about guns in America, have not abated.)  In the summer of 1998, then-U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey triggered an unseemly diplomatic skirmish during a fact-finding visit to the Dutch capital. The four-star general, charged with leading America's war on drugs, tensed up as he saw the smoke wafting out of perfectly legal pot-selling cafes in Amsterdam. He surveyed the permissive drug environment and publicly judged Dutch drug policy an "unmitigated disaster."  Dutch government officials responded with a barrage of statistics to prove the visitor wrong, and coffee shop customers declared McCaffrey had no idea what he was talking about.  The general may have been too focused on the drug situation to notice what was happening on the same-sex marriage front in the Netherlands. Perhaps he would have found that also disastrous. The parliament had just approved an innovative concept of "registered partnerships," allowing couples, gay and straight, to be treated more or less the same as their legally married counterparts.  In the United State then, during the 1990s, the weapon of choice in the Republican arsenal was "family values." The approval of same-sex marriage was about as likely in the United States as, say, Russian President Vladimir Putin officiating a gay wedding in Sochi today.  The 1992 and 1996 Republican conventions, which I attended as part of the CNN team, were choreographed carnivals of anti-gay invective.  It wasn't just Republicans. By substantial majorities, Americans opposed gay rights and, incidentally, strongly supported drug laws outlawing marijuana use.  In a CNN poll in 1998, a majority said they believed gay people can change their sexual orientation if they chose to do so.  But at the same time, American views were beginning to budge. Just as President Barack Obama's public embrace of same-sex marriage gave a boost to popular support, Bill Clinton sensed an increase in acceptance and tried to propel change with an effort to end the ban on gays in the military.  The reaction would have been laughable had it not been so outrageous. Sam Nunn, then the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, toured a submarine, expertly examining the bunks where sailors slept in close quarters. Obviously, the tour indicated, gay men would find the temptation of nearby sailors simply irresistible. Clinton changed course, approved the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy and signed the Defense of Marriage Act, both of which caused enormous injustices, both of which stayed in place until recently.  In 2001, George W. Bush took office, invigorating Republicans. That same year, the Netherlands became the world's first country to legalize same-sex marriage. The day the bill became law, Amsterdam's mayor became a registrar and personally officiated the country's first such wedding.  A Pew Research Center poll clocked support for same-sex marriage among Americans then at just 35%.  Despite the head winds, the battle for equal rights has not stopped, not in the United States, not in other corners of the world. As the German philosopher Georg Hegel explained more than 200 years ago, history itself is the progress of the consciousness of freedom.  It can be slowed. It can be delayed. But it cannot be stopped.  Today, America looks like a different country. In fact, in many respects it looks very much like the Netherlands.  Today, a majority of Americans support same-sex marriage, which is legal in 17 states and the District of Columbia. And that majority is sure to continue growing, because the numbers are overwhelming among young people. Even the legalization of marijuana, which is picking up legal support around the country, enjoys majority support.  Does that mean America is becoming more liberal? Not really.  In the Netherlands, the driving philosophy is one of tolerance and compromise. In the United States, the shift reflects a closer alignment with the country's historic embrace of freedom from the government. The "family values" efforts to legislate morality run counter to that libertarian notion of freedom. Liberals have always been more comfortable with the differences between people. And conservatives are increasingly redefining their stance on a number of social issues, concluding that different people can live different lives. The government should not interfere.  There are many other factors, of course. Activists have worked persistently to educate the public. And the entertainment industry has played an important role.  And the changes in America are echoes of a global trend. Secular, affluent countries tend to be more accepting of different lifestyle choices. Homosexuality is gaining acceptance in the West, while it is overwhelmingly condemned in Muslim countries, and in sub-Saharan Africa.  The Western world's attitude toward drugs is changing. "Hard" drugs and addiction are seen more as a disease than a moral failing. Marijuana, once demonized, is increasingly viewed as less harmful than alcohol.  There are many areas in which progressive Western nations, such as the Netherlands, are still sharply different from the United States. Differences over gun policy will likely persist, while views over contentious topics such as the right to die are likely to converge. For America, the driving force behind the transformation is found in a changing definition of the meaning of freedom.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.  
 Sumatra, Indonesia Flying over the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, I looked out the window and got my first exciting glimpse of the Sumatran rainforest. It was vast, lush and green, but it wasn't all rainforest.  There were squares of farmland and large patches of trees in neat rows that I knew were palm oil or pulp and paper plantations.  From above, the patches of green seemed to flow in and out of the rainforest, but I knew those patches of rainforest were shrinking.  I turned around and saw that the other members of our CNN crew on the plane with me-- correspondent Philippe Cousteau, tech expert John Sanders and Hong Kong based cameraman Scott Clotworthy-- were all looking out the windows, too.  After all the preparation and the travel delays, we had finally made it. We knew this was going to be a trip unlike any other.  Our first destination was at a very remote camp in Jambi Province near 30 Hills National Park. I knew how remote it was going to be, so it wasn't a surprise when we traded our caravan of pickup trucks for three giant off-road vehicles.  We knew since we were here during the rainy season, these vehicles were the only way to get up these extremely muddy mountain trails.  Read more: Phillipe Cousteau on why you should care about Sumatra  I didn't know just how treacherous these trails would be until the driver of our off-road truck stopped and told us that we would have to cross the bridges on foot. If a bridge broke or the truck slid off, we didn't want to be inside.  It was dark, and the CNN U.S. crew didn't have our gear because our luggage was lost in transit. I was the only one with hiking boots and Philippe was the only one with a flashlight.  We eased out of the trucks into slippery, squishy mud and walked slowly toward the bridge trying to avoid deep puddles.  These bridges were a test of our balance and nerve. Each bridge was two sets of heavy logs lashed together, one set of logs for the left tires and one set for the right. We looked down and estimated it to be a 6 meter drop.  We slowly and carefully walked across one side, one at a time, tightrope style. Scott and John even did it carrying their cameras.  Amazingly, no one slipped. Even more amazingly, the trucks all made it across with no problem. I was still very glad to see the camp lights come into view.  We had finally arrived at the Frankfurt Zoological Society Orangutan camp. This group is doing some amazing work to help replenish a critically endangered Sumatran orangutan population.  Their goal is to take captive Sumatran orangutans that were pets and teach them how to live in the wild so they can be released into the rainforest.  Orangutans were extinct in this area of Sumatra before the FZS came here. Now, more than 140 live in this patch of rainforest.  Once the generator powered down for the night, I lay in my bed and listened to the sounds of the rainforest just outside. Soon it started to rain and the sounds of the rain mixed with the sounds of the rainforest were incredible.  I will never forget the sound of the Sumatran rainforest surrounding me, and the feeling of knowing the next day I would see a captive orangutan released back into the wild.

New Delhi Narendra Modi took the oath of office Monday to become the 15th prime minister of India.  The swearing-in took place in a tightly guarded ceremony at the Colonial-era presidential mansion in New Delhi.  For the first time, leaders of an entire South Asian region attended, including Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of India's traditional archrival, Pakistan.  But it's not just the guest list that makes this inauguration historic.  Never in the past three decades has a political party taken up the reins of the world's largest democracy with an absolute majority.  And never before has a provincial chief with no federal experience become head of a national government.  Unprecedented invitation  In attendance on the sprawling forecourt of the sandstone palace were the premiers of Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Mauritius; the presidents of Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives; and the speaker of Bangladesh, officials say.  "A promising gesture," read the headline of an editorial in the Indian Express on Friday about India's unprecedented invitation to the leaders of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation bloc.  Until his election to Parliament this month, Modi, a chief minister of the prosperous northwestern state of Gujarat, has been seen as hawkish by some political watchers, especially over relations with nuclear archrival Pakistan.  His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has often accused the administration of outgoing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of being soft on its western neighbor, which New Delhi blames for a number of terror attacks in India, including the deadly 2008 assault in Mumbai. Both countries have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both claim as their own in its entirety.  An editorial in the Indian Express said Modi's "terrific" move to invite regional leaders "should help generate a more realistic appreciation of India's foreign-policy trajectory in the coming years."  "What matters in the end, however, is the prospect of a more self-assured government in Delhi that is ready to engage the neighbors without standing on protocol and precedent," it added.  Economic hope  Credited for his pro-business approach as the chief of Gujarat, India's new leader has also raised expectations that his government will succeed in turning around India's slowing economy, generate more jobs and rein in soaring prices and deeply entrenched corruption, issues that are widely believed to have brought about the fall of Singh's government.  Modi's party won 282 seats of the 543-seat lower house of Parliament on its own, the first independent win by any single political party in three decades. India has since been ruled by coalitions of national and regional groupings with varied political and economic philosophies.  "The BJP's single-handed majority in the new parliament ensures at least one thing: no more excuses of fractured coalition politics compromising policies and reforms," said Jahangir Aziz, J.P. Morgan's chief Asia economist, in a column in the Indian Express.  "More growth, more employment, more infrastructure, lower inflation is just motherhood and apple pie. Identifying and articulating the binding constraints holding these back is the heart of the problem," he wrote.  Political analysts also describe the debacle of Singh's Congress Party government as a vote against crushing prices.  "Moderation in prices of essential commodities is a potential challenge for Modi's government in a market-driven economy," political commentator K.G. Suresh said. "The honeymoon period will not last longer if measures are not taken in the next 100 days to bring costs down," he added.  Modi's Cabinet, observers say, will signify his government's model and course.  "It has to be a dream team that balances demands and side effects of growth with promises of low prices to millions of poverty-stricken Indians. It has to be a smart mix of youth and experience with a cohesive approach. With pressures of coalition politics no longer there, the last thing India would expect the new prime minister's core team to be is a chariot pulled by horses running in different directions," Suresh said.

 Somewhere, Dick Nixon wants a royalty check.  When New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie channeled his inner Tricky Dick and declared, "I am not a bully," he did himself no favors.  To be fair, Christie faced a dilemma: Either admit to creating a climate of bullying, intimidation and political payback that led to the George Washington Bridge scandal, or claim that his staff and appointees disrupted traffic on the world's busiest bridge as political punishment without his knowledge. In the business we call it a choice between being a crook or a schnook.  Ladies and gentlemen, meet Gov. Schnook.  A schnook, for those who don't speak Yiddish, is a dupe. A fool. A patsy. A schnook is a victim, and Chris Christie is not convincing playing the victim. He wants us to believe that Gov. Straight-Talk, Mister No-B.S., credulously believed a pack of lies from his close aides.  He wants us to believe that, as a former federal prosecutor, he thought his one-hour "investigation" of this operation, which yielded no confessions, was all that he could have done to unearth the truth. The governor clearly hopes that his press conference, his apology and his firing of one whole person will put this issue to rest.  It won't.  There's a great old saying that battle-scarred scandal managers love: "The dogs bark but the carnival moves on." It's the crisis manager's equivalent of "Take two aspirin and call me in the morning," meant to reassure the scandal-plagued public figure that the media and the public have short attention spans, and that the next twerking episode will distract folks.  But not with the Chris Christie bridge-closing scandal: This one's gonna stick.  How do I know? Three reasons:  1.  It feeds a pre-existing narrative. This is the most important factor in determining whether a miscue becomes a scandal and whether a scandal becomes a permanent taint. Any issue that advances a narrative that people already have is given greater credence and is more memorable.  Every public figure has a master narrative. In fact they have two: one positive, one negative. In the case of Christie, his larger-than-life persona has been drawn both with bold strokes and in vivid color. The positive narrative is compellingand true: the straight-talking, forceful, blunt leader; the no-nonsense take-charge guy who blasted as "stupid and selfish" his own constituents who did not evacuate a beach community before a hurricane.  Christie's negative narrative is just as powerful, and just as true: bully. He burst on the national scene in YouTube clips of town hall meetings where he berated critics. As The New York Times reported, as governor, Christie has a remarkable pattern of bullying: stripping former Gov. Richard Codey of his security detail after Codey called Christie "combative and difficult;" cutting funding to a Rutgers University program run by a professor who sided with Democrats on a redistricting panel, and more.  If, as it appears, Christie's appointees and staff forced New Jerseyans to suffer through a four-hour traffic jam because their mayora Democrathad the temerity to back the Democratic candidate opposing Christie's re-election, it doesn't just feed the image of a bully; it cements it.  2. There are ongoing legal and political processes. The Democratic majority leader of the State Senate, Loretta Weinberg, described herself as shocked by the scandal. More importantand more ominous, for Christieshe declared, "I am waitingand hopefully with the support of Assemblyman (and Deputy Speaker John) Wisniewskithat the subpoena power will continue." Continuing subpoenas mean continuing revelations. "Sooner rather than later," Weinberg said, "we're going to hear the whole story of who knew what when."  There are almost certainly going to be lawsuits from aggrieved commuters, which will put folks under oath. And, most ominously, the U.S. attorney has said he is looking into the matter. If this becomes a federal case, the stakes rise immeasurably.  3. It happened at the media epicenter. It's not fair, but it's true: The news media is based largely on the East Coast and principally in New York. If the governor of South Dakota closed the Chief Standing Bear Bridge, which connects South Dakota to Nebraska, most of the national media would not know or care. But this is the George Washington Bridge. Journalists can cover this story, literally, on their commute. Christie's proximity to the media center has helped fuel his celebrity; now it may fuel his downfall.  The truth is there is not much Christie can do about these three dynamics. He tried apologizing, but kept returning to the plea that he is truly the victim here: that he's just a poor schnook who was lied to.  It seems to me that is small comfort to the thousands of people who endured four-hour traffic jams, or schoolchildren trapped on endless bus rides, or the family of the elderly woman who died after emergency services were slow in getting to her. He tried blaming others, as if acting in a Sopranoesque fashion is totally antithetical to his political style. Soon he will return to attacking the press and Democrats. None of it will work.  If you believe Bullygate is going away anytime soon, there's a bridge in Fort Lee I'd like to sell you.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.

It has been three days since Chris Stevens and three other Americans lost their lives in Benghazi, Libya. I lived and worked for four years in Libya, leaving hurriedly last year in an evacuation as the civil war began. I sit safely now in my new home in Qatar, and those who shared my Libyan experiencesand who knew Chrisare now spread out around the world. I know from their e-mails that, like me, they are also unspeakably sad.  Every life on this good earth is precious, and all four Americans who lost their lives at the U.S. Consulate were in Benghazi to help the Libyan efforts. They will be very, very much missed.  Because I knew and worked with Chris, I understand firsthand that the world has lost a true hero, and we seem to have precious few of those. Chris was smart, supportive, kind, approachable, very passionate about reestablishing a relationship between the United States and Libya and improving the lives of the Libyan people. He was a perfect candidate for his new role as ambassador. When someone like that is taken away, you don't just mourn the loss of a colleague or friend, you mourn the greater loss for our planet.  We were both originally from northern California, but Chris and I first met in Libya, arriving around the same time in 2007. I was there as the new director of the fledgling American School of Tripoli and Chris had just been appointed U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission. The United States and Libya had reestablished diplomatic relations in 2004, but the U.S. Liaison Office had just been upgraded to a full embassy in 2006. Because no ambassador had yet been named, as deputy chief, Chris served as acting ambassador until the arrival of Ambassador Gene Cretz in January 2009.  Working in Libya at that time was challenging. The infrastructure that the West left behind had long disappeared during the 30 years of sanctions, and we were all scrambling to develop our institutions and businesses from the ground up. Chris built a team of embassy personnel, negotiated with a quixotic Libyan government, helped the returning U.S. companies and served as chairman of the Board of Trustees of the American School.  He loved the school and in an e-mail earlier this year shared how much he was looking forward to witness its eventual reopening.  During the two years we worked together, I watched Chris serve with aplomb, patience, and an easy smile. If you sat and talked with him, it was clear that he was well-read and a deep thinker, but he was always humble.  He was also extremely comfortable whether he was speaking with VIPs or Libyan farmers. I had the good fortune to sit with him on the Fulbright Scholarship Committee that helped Libyans further their education in America, one of the many tangible ways he demonstrated his dedication to the Libyan people.  He traveled across the sparsely populated country savoring the rich archaeological sites, and broke bread with Berbers in their cave homes. Always gracious, he hosted receptions for Libyan ministers and businessmen and, just as often, was in khakis and a T-shirt, holding informal embassy gatherings on the roof of his villa, smiling and making sure that everyone was included.  What really made Chris exceptional to me, however, was his ability to distance himself. Not the aloof kind of distancing that you might expect from someone in his position, but the kind where one puts emotion and ego aside in order to truly listen, to understand, and then to find a way to build bridges. It is extremely rare to find someone who can do that, consistently rising above the fray, and that's what makes his death so especially painful.  Of course I feel anger at those horribly misguided people who are responsible for this tragedy, but I am also trying to rise above it, like Chris would. For those who find this yet another reason to vilify Muslims, I point to other examples of seemingly senseless violence like the Aurora movie theater shootings or the attack on Gabrielle Giffords, neither of which had anything to do with Islam.  We live in a world where frustration and anger override the sanctity of life. We live in a world where it's easier to get our hands on weapons than to give each other a helping hand. We live in a world where too many people use religion as a vehicle for hatred, rather than love.  I was extremely fortunate for a few years to have lived and worked under the light of Chris' grace and vision. I know he touched all who knew him. As I continue to watch the Libyans, who have only known oppression, try to dig out of the void left behind in the wake of Moammar Gadhafi's fall, I will always remember Chris and the legacy he has left them.  We are all better for having known Chris. My hope is hope that Libya will flourish for its people and that we, each in our own way, will make him proud.

 Recovery crews in southern New Mexico were working to reach a child's body at the bottom of a 30-foot-deep hole Sunday.  Authorities believe the child is Samuel Jones, who went missing Saturday, Carlsbad Police Department spokeswoman Lt. Jennifer Moyers said in a statement.  Officials think the child died when he fell into the hole in his neighbor's yard, CNN affiliate KOAT reported.  "We initially began with rescue procedures. Unfortunately, it was discovered that the conditions inside the hole were not survivable, the amount of oxygen that was there, the temperature, that type of thing," Carlsbad Police Chief Daniel Fierro told CNN affiliate KRQE.  A detective searching for the 4-year-old Sunday morning spotted the body when he shined a light into the neighbor's well, KOAT reported.  It could take a day for mining crews to reach the body safely, state police said.  "It breaks my heart, that little boy down there," heavy equipment operator Paul Kartscner told KOAT.  Crews were digging a trench from the side of the hole and shoring up the sides, KOAT said.  Investigators, who said Saturday that they feared the boy had been abducted by a stranger, said Sunday that they were treating the case as a homicide until they determine a cause of death, KRQE reported.

Moments after blasting what he called Russia's illegal "military aggression" of his nation, Ukraine's interim leader insisted Thursday that a peaceful resolution that ends with Kiev and Moscow becoming "real partners" is still possible.  "We still believe that we have a chance to resolve these conflicts in a peaceful manner," interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told the U.N. Security Council.  Yatsenyuk's remarks come as thousands of Russian troops staged military exercises not far from his nation's border.  And they are entirely new, given that Ukrainian officials have previously called for talks and slammed what they say is Russia's military invasion of their country, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied.  Still, the stageaddressing representatives of the world's most powerful nations, Russia among themmakes the assertions more salient, as does the fast approaching referendum in which residents of the Crimean Peninsula will vote whether to secede from Ukraine and join Russia.  Ukraine has been simmering since last November, when protesters angry at the sitting governmentin part for its president's move toward Russia and away from the European Unionbegan hitting the streets. In February, after deadly clashes between government forces and demonstrators, President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted (he soon took refuge in Russia).  With that, the focus moved from Ukraine's west, which tends to lean more European, to its south and east, where ties to Russia are stronger.  Rising tensions have centered on Crimea, where local officials have declared their autonomy from Ukraine and alliance with Russia, as armed men have blockaded and taken other actions against Ukrainian military and other posts.  Tensions also have spilled over into other parts of eastern Ukraine, such as Donetsk, where the regional health authority said a 22-year-old man was stabbed to death and at least 10 others were injured in clashes Thursday between pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian protesters.  While the bloodshed has been limited so far, fears are percolating that this crisis could turn into a full-scale military conflict.  "We are looking for an answer to the question of whether the Russians want war," Yatsenyuk said Thursday in Russian. "I am sure that, as the prime minister of Ukraine, (which) for decades had warm and friendly relations with Russia, I am convinced that Russians do not want war.  Russia kicks off military drill  On Thursday, Putin reiterated his longstanding stance: Ukraine's crisis was caused by internal factors, not by Russia. And if people in Crimeaincluding ethnic Russianswant to be part of Russia, that's their right and likewise Moscow's right to protect them.  Speaking after Yatsenyuk at the United Nations, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin accused the West of having "fanned the flames of unrest" in Ukraine by their officials' "blatant interference," which he said contributed to Yanukovych's "illegal" ouster. Since then, the Ukraine's pro-western government has exacerbated the crisis by clamping down on opposition and effectively "splitting this country (into) two parts," Churkin said.  As to Sunday's referendum, the ambassador said citizens there deserve the same right to self-determination as anyone: "Why should the Crimeans be the exception?"  Even as Moscow hasn't said it wants to takeover Ukraine, its military has become noticeably active in the region of lateand not just its thousands of troops stationed in Crimea.  Its most recent such action was starting military drills Thursday involving about 8,500 artillery men in the southern part of the country bordering Ukraine, according to Russia's defense ministry. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power portrayed the "new military operations" as connected to the "Russian military intervention," telling the Security Council on Thursday that they involve "artillery batteries, assault helicopters and at least 10,000 additional soldiers near the Ukrainian border."  These exerciseswhich include rocket launchers, howitzers and anti-tank cannonsaim to "improve the cooperation between artillery (units) and motorized rifle forces, tank forces, air cavalry and the marines," Russia's defense ministry said.  The Southern Military District borders Ukraine and includes the North Caucasian Military District, the Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian flotilla, the ministry said. One of its four bases is in the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol.  The troops involved in these drills seemingly are in addition to the up to 25,000 Russian troops already stationed in Ukraine.  Not far away, U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is expected to announce plans to keep the aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush in the Mediterranean Sea longer than planned to reassure NATO allies who may be feeling insecure after Russia's moves in Crimea, CNN has learned.  Asked about the decision to keep the aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, a senior administration official said not to expect much more muscle-flexing, or additional military steps, before Sunday.  Ukraine financial package stalled in Congress  Russia's military activities within Ukraine itselfincluding whether its troops are among the men, whose uniforms did not have insignias, who have seemingly marooned Ukraine's military thereare a matter of intense scrutiny and debate.  Yatsenyuk stated Thursday he has no doubt Russian troops have intervened, despite having "no grounds" to do so. He said Russia's military presence "is clearly identified," pointing out that vehicles used by some armed men have Russian license plates.  "This is absolutely and entirely unacceptable in the 21st century to resolve any kind of (conflict) with boots on the ground," the interim prime minister said.  Western officials warn Moscow  Western officials, meanwhile, warned Thursday that Russia will face significant consequences unless it changes course in Crimea, with U.S. President Barack Obama pledging to "stand with Ukraine."  In a speech to the German parliament, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday's secession referendum is unconstitutional and Russia's presence in the Black Sea peninsula violates Ukraine's territorial integrity. She warned Putin that his actions would lead to "catastrophe" for Ukraine.  "It would also change Russia economically and politically," she said.  In a phone call, French President Francois Hollande told Putin the referendum "has no legal basis," urging the Russian leader to "do everything to prevent the annexation of Crimea to Russia."  At a Senate committee hearing in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerrywho is set to meet Friday with his Russian counterpartpredicted that the upcoming vote would favor Crimea rejoining Russia.  But he warned that, absent movement by Russia toward negotiating with Ukraine on the crisis, "there will be a very serious series of steps Monday in Europe and here."  Already, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it had postponed activities related to Russia's process for membership in the organization.  In a boost to Kiev, members also "agreed that the OECD should respond positively to Ukraine's request to further strengthen existing OECD-Ukraine cooperation to take advantage of the OECD's expertise to address the public policy challenges it faces."  'Putin's opinion is much more important'  Crimea is on edge, as evidenced by flaring tensions and growing worries as evidenced by long lines at banks in the regional capital of Simferopol.  Separately, Crimean authorities have secured offshore Ukrainian oil and gas projects in the Black and Azov seas, as well as the Chernomorneftegaz company's oil and gas fields, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported Thursday, citing Crimean parliamentary speaker Vladimir Konstantinov.  "These deposits and the platform fully become the property of the Republic of Crimea," he said. "We have guarded them. These are our fields and we will fight for them."  A decision on Ukraine's Chernomorneftegaz has not been made, Russia's Interfax news agency reported, citing Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliev. He said consultations would take place on whether "this enterprise will remain the property of the Republic of Crimea or will become part of Gazprom," the Russian energy giant.  Ukraine's armed forces deployed in Crimea have been bottled up since late last month, but they're free to leave their bases to vote in the referendum, said Yury Zherebtsov, the Crimean government's official in charge of the ballot, according to Interfax. Zherebtsov said officials had visited military bases across Crimea to convince soldiers that "they have simply become hostage of the Ukrainian government" and to understand that "the only way to maintain the peace and unity of the Crimean people is by forming a union with Russia."  The new, pro-Russian government on the southeastern peninsula has said that if the voters opt to join Russia, the first step would be to declare Crimea an independent and sovereign state. Then it will apply to join the Russian Federation.  INFOGRAPHIC: Comparing Ukraine and Russia's military forces  CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Simferopol, as did journalist Nadjie Femi.

 Three weeks after four Americans were killed in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in eastern Libya, an FBI team arrived at the site as the investigation continued in other places, too, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday.  "You should not assume that all we could do or have been doing is restricted solely to Benghazi," Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters in Washington. "There are a variety of other places in country and outside the country where relevant things could be done and have been done. This is a matter that's been under active investigation almost since the time of the incident and I'm satisfied with the progress that we have made."  Holder said the focus of the Justice Department was "to solve this matter, to hold people accountable. So that's what we will do."  Pentagon spokesman George Little said Thursday that a U.S. military support mission accompanied the FBI team, which was in Benghazi "for a number of hours" before it left the city.  "We have not been sitting around waiting, you know, for information to come to us," Little said, adding that U.S. investigators were "actively chasing leads in various ways."  U.S. Special Operations forces were in Libya and nearby countries aiding in the collection of intelligence regarding the assault, a U.S. military official told CNN Thursday. The official declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information.  Read more: CNN finds, returns journal belonging to late U.S. ambassador  The September 11 consulate attack killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The incident heightened global scrutiny of the North African nation and sparked debate over whether the Obama administration has been forthcoming about the incident.  Read more: U.S. gathers information about possible targets in Libya  Officials said the military presence was an indication of ongoing security concerns in the region.  Security concerns at the site had led the FBI to delay for more than three weeks its visit to Benghazi. FBI and military officials had cited the need for proper military protection in the event of another attack.  Little described the security team accompanying  the FBI as a "small footprint of military personnel."  Read more: In revision, U.S. intelligence believes Libya attack a terror assault  The visit took place after the Libyans approved the presence of the FBI and the U.S. military in Benghazi.  The U.S. military force that provided security was approved by Libyan government, Little said.  Kevin Perkins, FBI associate deputy director, told a congressional hearing on September 19 that a "significant number of FBI agents, analysts and various support employees" had been assigned to the case.  "We are conducting interviews, gathering evidence and trying to sort out the facts, working with our partners both from a criminal standpoint, as well as in the intelligence community, to try to determine exactly what took place on the ground that evening," he told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs.  Read more: US, Libyan officials meet to assess what went wrong  The failure of investigators to visit the site in the immediate aftermath of the attack has raised questions about the integrity of the FBI investigation and concerns that sensitive documents may have been left unsecured.  Three days after the attack, CNN Senior Correspondent Arwa Damon discovered Stevens' journal during a visit to the unguarded, abandoned compound.  This week, a Washington Post reporter visiting the site found sensitive documents, including personnel records of Libyans who had been contracted to provide security, emergency evacuation protocols and details of U.S. weapons collection efforts.  But a State Department official told CNN that no classified documents had been left on the premises.  In the days after the assault, U.S. administration officials offered conflicting assessments as what may have led to the fatal security breach.  Officials initially said the violence erupted spontaneously amid a large protest about a privately made video produced in the United States that mocked the Prophet Mohammed.  But the U.S. intelligence community revised its assessment, saying it believes it was a planned terrorist assault.  The intelligence community now believes it was "a deliberate and organized terrorist assault carried out by extremists" affiliated with or sympathetic to al Qaeda.  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said the attack was "clearly" planned and conducted by terrorists, and that it "took a while" for there to be information to reach such a conclusion.  But a senior U.S. official told CNN that, within a day or so of the attack, the U.S. intelligence community had begun to gather information suggesting it was the work of extremists either affiliated with or inspired by al Qaeda groups.

Britain's Jenson Button won the Belgian Grand Prix Sunday after a spectacular first corner crash ended the hopes of championship leader Fernando Alonso and three other drivers.  Frenchman Romain Grosjean clipped the McLaren of Button's teammate Lewis Hamilton and catapulted into the air in his Lotus, flying over Ferrari's Alonso and narrowly avoiding the head of the two-time champion from Spain.  Mexican Sergio Perez of Sauber was also caught up in the crash.  Miraculously, no-one was injured in the incident, but a safety car was deployed while the debris was cleared off the circuit at Spa-Francorchamps.  Grosjean was later given a one-race ban by stewards after being held responsible for the carnage.  Button, who was on pole, avoided the incident and quickly took command for his second victory of the year and the 14th of his career.  The 2009 world champion came home nearly 14 seconds ahead of defending champion Sebastian Vettel, the Red Bull driver capitalizing on the chaos after starting a lowly 10th on the grid.  Finland's Kimi Raikkonen for Lotus completed a podium of world champions in third place.  Button, who has struggled since his opening race victory in Australia was delighted by his change in fortunes.  "What can I say, this circuit is so special to most drivers with the history and the way it flows. To get a victory from lights to flag is very special, especially as it has not been an easy year for me. We are going to enjoy this before we head to Monza (for the Italian GP) and hopefully do the same," he told the official post-race conference.  German Nico Hulkenberg was a surprise fourth for Force India ahead of Brazil's Felipe Massa in his Ferrari.  Vettel has closed up to 24 points behind Alonso in the title standings, with teammate Webber, sixth in Belgium, eight points further adrift.  Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher marked his 300th Grand Prix with a fine drive for seventh in the Mercedes ahead of their Toro Rosso pair of Jean-Eric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo.  Briton Paul Di Resta took the final point in 10th place in the second Force India.  
 Is there anything Monopoly can't do?  Over the course of its 80-year life, it's been played underwater, underground, in space (OK, just the tokens) and on giant game boards. It's used chocolate and featured real money. There have been games that barely lasted the night and marathon contests that went on for weeks.  Not bad for a game that, according to lore, maker Parker Brothers originally rejected for containing "52 fundamental errors."  March 19 marks the official 80th anniversary of the world's best-selling board game, now manufactured by Hasbro. Its circuitous history, like its game board, has been filled with several interesting turns. Here are a few:  Legend has it that Charles Darrow, an unemployed salesman, invented the game in his kitchen in 1930. But the roots of Monopoly actually date back a few more decades, to a game called the Landlord's Game created by Elizabeth Magie in 1903.  The Landlord's Game was meant to be educational, illustrating economist Henry George's beliefinspired by the Gilded Agethat property ownership by individuals is inherently unfair. Magie's game was an underground success, leading to a number of offshoots, including the one that Darrow tweaked. Parker Brothers bought her patent for $500 in 1935, closing the loop.  As for Darrow, he was inspired in 1932 by a version created by a New Jersey Quaker community that made Atlantic City the locale of the game. Darrow added colors and other design elements"a look and feel to his board that would prove immensely appealing," writes Philip E. Orbanes in "Monopoly," a 2006 history of the game.  Darrow's game was initially rejected by Parker Brothers for three errorsnot 52but when his independent sales took off, Parker Brothers bought the game from him. The date? March 19, 1935.  The numbers are staggering. Monopoly has been translated into 47 languages. It's played in 114 countries. It's sold more than 275 million copies.  Hasbro prints $30 billion in Monopoly money each year, and well more than $3 trillion has been printed since 1935. Not bad considering each standard game comes with $20,580though it's in the rules that the bank can never go broke, so make up some scrip if you need it.  Incidentally, the Monopoly Mannamed Rich Uncle Pennybagswas likely based on mustachioed financier J.P. Morgan.  Even before numerous editions of Monopoly were widely licensed, there were local board variations depending on the country. Boardwalk, for example, is Mayfair in Britain, Schlossallee in Germany, Kalverstraat in the Netherlands and Rue de la Paix in France, after major streets in London, Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris. Other streets have also drawn from local geography.  The new "Here & Now" U.S. edition, however, opened the voting to enthusiastsand Pierre (population 14,000), the capital of South Dakota, won pride of place as Boardwalk. (Lima, Peru, won the World Edition.)  Pierre was one of 60 cities in the running, Mayor Laurie Gill said, and was "in the bottom of the pack" when she was informed of the contest. Being a competitive sort, she was determined to push Pierre past perhaps more logical cities such as New York or Los Angeles.  "It's our energy and the fact we engaged our citizens," she told CNN. "I was doing radio and press releases and working with our school district, and our Chamber of Commerce utilized social media. It became a big deal here."  One consideration for visitors: Pierre is on the Missouri River, but it lacks a literal boardwalk. (There are paths.) Still, given the city's triumph, you probably wouldn't want to play Monopoly against an energized Pierre resident.  Pierre may be doing better than Atlantic City, which has struggled since the mid-2000s to return to its gambling heyday. Still, the New Jersey resort does have Monopoly to thank for some of its famenot that it was appreciated at one time.  In the early '70s, a city commissioner proposed renaming Mediterranean and Baltic avenues, since both had other names in different parts of town. The idea caused an uproar among Monopoly fans and the idea was eventually shot down.  "Baltic and Mediterranean are the streets we know," wrote one commissioner. "Without them, we could never pass Go."  Do you put money from Chance and Community Chest in the center of the board and collect it when landing on Free Parking? Not in the rules. Do you give $400 for landing on Go instead of $200? Not in the rules. Do you allow secret side deals? Uh-uh. (Admittedly, there is now a set of "House Rules" that allow for variations, but they're not official.)  The dismissive line "Do not pass Go, do not collect $200," which has worked its way into a few songs, is from Monopoly. And the game also gave us the term "Monopoly money," as in worthless currency.  There aren't many movies featuring the game, but "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" has a famous scene with William Redfield and Danny DeVito arguing over DeVito's play. Stay tuned, though: a Monopoly movie is back on after several years in Hollywood purgatory.  So forget the classic definition of "Monopoly money." Hasbro has taken quite a bunch to the bank.  The original set featured a top hat, iron, shoe, thimble, battleship and cannon. Over the years, some pieces have been retiredincluding a purse, rocking horse and lanternand others have been added. The latest? A bag of money and a cat. And they're all still made of metal, just as they've been for decades.  Want to win at Monopoly? Though there's some chance involved (pardon the pun), the low-rent light blues and the mid-market oranges are the most desirable, according to a study done for Maxine Brady's 1974 "The Monopoly Book." The oranges and reds are the most likely to be landed on. The more upscale greens will pay off eventually, but they're expensive to develop, so you'd better have another form of cash flow in the short term.  Or you could just do what millions have done since Darrow's day: Land on someone else's hotel, get mad and turn over the game board. Hey, it worked in college.

Steve Jobs, who resigned as CEO of the world's largest tech company late Wednesday, is often identified as the singular face of Applethe man who is the energy and creative spirit behind the company.  But Apple is much more than just Steve Jobs.  Jobs himself has said so in the past.  "Apple is an incredibly collaborative company," Jobs said in an onstage interview at a tech conference last year. "We're organized like a startup. We're the biggest startup on the planet."  Not everyone buys this argument, of course, and Apple stocks fell 5% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after his resignation was announced in a letter. Jobs has been elected as Apple's chairman, but some observers question how much he will be able to contribute due to health reasons.  The 56-year-old went on a medical leave of absence earlier this year, his third time as CEO.  At the AllThingsD tech event last year, Jobs boasted that Apple's corporate structure doesn't include committees, which is a common practice among big business for distributing the responsibility for strategy among key executives. A different person leads each hardware, software and business division, he said.  "Teamwork is dependent on trusting the other folks to come through with their part without watching them all the time," Jobs said at the time. "We're great at figuring out how to divide things up into these great teams that we have and all work on the same thing, touch bases frequently and bring it all together into a product."  Furthermore, Apple has a succession plan in place.  Tim Cook, the operations wizard who is replacing Jobs as CEO, already has proven himself an adept manager. Cook filled in as interim CEO during Jobs' three medical leaves. Jobs announced his most recent absence in January, and Cook has taken over his duties since then. Apple has set business performance records during every quarter this year.  In his resignation letter, Jobs wrote that he strongly recommended Cook's appointment.  "I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it," Jobs wrote. "And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role."  "Steve's extraordinary vision and leadership saved Apple and guided it to its position as the world's most innovative and valuable technology company," Art Levinson, an Apple board member, said in a statement, adding that the board "has complete confidence that Tim is the right person to be our next CEO."  The CEO of any company has an important role, but Apple is structured in a way where it's less so, according to Jobs.  Jobs' influence touches practically all facets of the company, analysts say. In the onstage interview, Jobs described his role as having to meet with the various units and contribute ideas. But what features make it into the next iPhone or iPad is often determined by the people who are dedicated to working on their respective products, he said.  "If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions, and you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy," Jobs said. "The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don't stay."  At Apple, the good people Jobs is referring to are part of the "top 100," a group that convenes regularly at off-site locations to share ideas, according to a recent Fortune article. A smaller group of executives also meets weekly to discuss the business, Jobs said.  "We all meet for three hours once a week, and we talk about everything we're doing," Jobs said. "And there's tremendous teamwork at the top of the company, which filters down to tremendous teamwork through the company."  As Jobs' managerial presence dwindles, Apple is in no immediate danger, because his thinking has been ingrained into many of the company's 46,600 employees, industry analyst Tim Bajarin said in a statement.  Apple outlines its product plans five years in advance and "has a deep bench of executives who know how Steve Jobs thinks, what his vision is for the next decade and are more than capable," Bajarin wrote.  Jobs and others have indicated that Apple is poised to continue producing popular products, and so most consumers won't notice a change, Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester Research analyst, said in a recent interview.  "I don't think the average person cares what's going on with Apple's leader," she said.  Apple is driven by "core values," Jobs said last year, not by one man. "We have the same values now, as we had then," he said. "We're a little more experienced, certainly beat-up, but the core values are the same."  
 Bayern Munich closed to within two points of Bundesliga leaders Hamburg and Bayer Leverkusen with a 2-1 victory at home to Bavarian rivals Nuremberg on Saturday.  Belgian defender Daniel Van Buyten celebrates his winning goal for Bayern Munich.  Daniel Van Buyten's 82nd-minute winner left Bayern on 13 points behind the two top teams, who are in action on Sunday, and above Hoffenheim and Mainz on goal difference.  Mainz won 3-2 away to Bochum on Saturday, while Hoffenheim scored three late goals to snatch a 4-2 victory at Borussia Moenchengladbach.  They moved above Schalke, who lost 2-1 to coach Felix Magath's former team, defending champions Wolfsburg, on Friday night.  Bayern broke into the top three for the first time this season despite again starting with France star Franck Ribery on the substitutes' bench, where he was joined by Miroslav Klose as young striker Thomas Muller was given the chance to add to his run of four goals in two games.  Nuremberg fielded a defensive line-up, but striker Mario Gomez still managed to hit the crossbar for Bayern before Ivica Olic broke the deadlock in the 55th minute.  The Croatia forward scored his second goal of the season after being fed in the penalty area by Muller, who was earlier denied one-on-one by goalkeeper Raphael Schafer.  The visitors shocked the 69,000-strong crowd in the 73rd minute when Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting equalized after good work by 18-year-old midfielder Ilkay Gundogan.  However, Belgian defender Van Buyten followed up his midweek Champions League goal in the win over Maccabi Haifa by heading Arjen Robben's right-wing cross into the far corner to help launch the city's Oktoberfest in fine style.  Hoffenheim moved into fourth place on 11 points as Senegalese striker Demba Ba scored in the first minute of injury-time to seal victory over Moenchengladbach.  Brazilian midfielder Maicosuel had equalized in the 86th minute and then Nigerian forward Chinedu Obasi put the visitors ahead three minutes later.  The hosts had led 2-0 after 17 minutes through Juan Arango and Roberto Colautti, but Sejad Salihovic's free-kick beat goalkeeper Logan Bailly from an impossibly tight angle four minutes later to reduce the deficit.  Mainz earned victory at Bochum thanks to a second-half double from 18-year-old striker Andre Schuerle.  Midfielder Mimoun Azaouagh put the home side ahead after only seven minutes and striker Diego Fernando Klimowicz doubled the lead at the end of first-half regulation timebut Andreas Ivanschitz reduced the deficit before the whistle blew for the interval.  Schuerle netted in the 52nd and 71st minutes to give Mainz a third win from six league outings.  Cologne moved off the bottom of the table with their first victory, winning 2-0 at Stuttgart with a 25th-minute header from Sebastian Freis before goalkeeper Jens Lehmann's 89th-minute error let in striker Manasseh Ishiaku.  In Saturday's other game, Hannover were held 1-1 at home by Borussia Dortmund as Didier Ya Konan scored three minutes after halftime for the hosts to cancel out Nuri Sahin's goal just before the break.  On Sunday, Hamburg travel to Eintracht Frankfurt, Leverkusen host Werder Bremen and bottom club Hertha Berlin are at home to Freiburg.  On Friday, striker Edin Dzeko scored twice to haunt his former mentor Magath as champions Wolfsburg moved onto nine points with a third win of the Bundesliga season.  The Bosnian broke the deadlock in the 55th minute with a header from Sascha Riether's cross, but Benedikt Howedes leveled with a header of his own 10 minutes from time from Levan Kenia's corner.  However, Dzeko relieved the pressure on coach Armin Veh a minute later to end a run of three defeats as he fired home from eight yards after being set up by substitute Makoto Hasebe.  Schalke substitute Kevin Kuranyi had a late header blocked on the line by goalkeeper Andre Lenz, filling in for the suspended Diego Benaglio.

In November, dozens of armed men descended on a town in northern Nigeria and killed more than 100 people in a coordinated series of bombings and gun attacks.  Many of those targeted were Christians, but police stations and mosques deemed "insufficiently Islamic" were also attacked.  The town was Damataru, capital of the Nigerian state of Yobe, and the assailants belonged to the group Boko Haram, which translates from the local Hausa as "Western education is outlawed."  In two years, Boko Haram has morphed from a radical Muslim sect into an insurgency responsible for dozens of attacks in Nigeria and beyond. Western intelligence analysts believe it is also developing links with al Qaeda affiliates in Africa.  Boko Haram's targets include police outposts and churches, as well as places associated with 'western influence.' Its signature attack is a Karachi-style drive-by shooting from a motorbike, but this year it has begun a campaign of suicide vehicle attacks.  In Maiduguri, the epicenter of the insurgency, there is a heavy military presence, with security checkpoints, sandbagged military positions and the scars left by bomb attacks.  CNN.com: Nigerian officials condemn church attack  House-to-house searches are common. A senior military officer admitted last week that Maiduguri was a dangerous place, with "miscreants" slipping across the nearby borders with Chad and Niger. The Nigerian authorities seem unable to overcome Boko Haramand its growing footprint worries neighboring states and the U.S. Africa Command.  Many Christians in northeastern Nigeria have fled their homes as the violence has worsened this year.  A government offer of amnesty has had little effect; the deployment of 20,000 Nigerian troops to deal with ethnic and religious violence has failed to subdue the group.  President Goodluck Jonathan has warned of "swift and certain justice for criminal elements"but analysts say that the inefficiency of the Nigerian state, rampant corruption and a heavy-handed military response may play into Boko Haram's hands.  Until 2009, Boko Haram was a fundamentalist sect that espoused a Taliban-like interpretation of Islam. It did not advocate violence but it was hostile to Nigeria's Muslim leadership for its compromises with the 'infidel.'  One day in July that year, police stopped some of its members on motorbikesand told them to wear helmets. Tempers flared. When the bikers resisted, police opened firekilling nine members of the group, according to witness reports collected by Shehu Sani, the President of the Civil Rights Congress.  The Congress is an independent human rights group based in northern Nigeria, and Sani has had extensive contacts with figures in Boko Haram.  In the days after that confrontation, hundreds of Boko Haram members were killed in clashes with security services. Among them, the group's charismatic leader Mohammed Yusuf, who died while in the custody of police, according to Sani.  A secondary school dropout, Yusuf preached a strict application of Sharia law in northern Nigeria, arguing that the rich and connected had evaded Sharia despite its formal adoption by several Muslim-majority states in Nigeria. His message resonated with thousands of marginalized Muslims. Boko Haram can also draw on the deepening inequalities and religious divide between north and south Nigeria to help recruitment.  After the crackdown, security services accused the group of planning an armed jihad in Nigeria by stockpiling weapons, including guns, explosives, and grenades, and purchasing land for paramilitary training. A significant number of members fled to neighboring Niger and Chad. But far from this being a victory for the security services, it brought Boko Haram members into contact with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).  According to U.S. officials, the groups have since forged a partnershipwith AQIM sharing its evolving expertise in suicide bombing.  "We know that there are increasingly frequent contacts, and indeed, training of members of Boko Haram by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and that's of great concern," Ambassador Anthony Holmes, U.S. Africa Command's civilian deputy said earlier this month. Algerian officials, long concerned at the growth of AQIM, have voiced the same concerns. And last week a senior Nigerian military officer told Reuters: "Boko Haram is al Qaeda."  In a global poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2009, a higher percentage of Nigerian Muslims (54%) stated they had confidence in Osama bin Laden than in any other Muslim-majority country.  Boko Haram's muscle was enhanced a year ago when the group freed at least a hundred of its members from a prison in Bauchi in northeastern Nigeria. This year, Boko Haram has begun looking to new horizons, including the capital, Abuja. In June, the group carried out its first suicide bombingattacking the National Police headquarters. Two months laterin a dramatic escalation of its campaignit launched a suicide car bombing against the U.N. headquarters in Abuja, killing 23.  Boko Haram released a video featuring a martyrdom recording by the suicide bomber in the attacka-27-year-old from Maiduguriwho praised Osama bin Laden and referred to the U.N. headquarters as a "forum of all the global evil."  The U.N. attack, Sani says, was likely an attempt by Boko Haram to embarrass the Nigerian government. He believes the group's Shura Council decided that attacking the U.N. would create less of a backlash against the group than directly targeting American interests.  "When they attacked the U.N. headquarters, they had to pass the American Embassy to Nigeria just a few meters away, but they knew the implications of targeting American interests: that things would get worse for them," Sani said.  U.S. officials believe some of those involved in that plot may have also trained with the al Qaeda linked militant group Al Shabaab in Somalia. In September, U.S. military officials warned that Boko Haram, AQIM, and al Shabaab might make common cause in targeting American interests in the region.  Earlier this month, the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria warned that Boko Haram may be plotting to target three luxury hotels in Abuja.  Al Qaeda in West & Central Africa?  According to Shehu Sani, the group's agenda is still primarily local. "The origin of their fight is with the government of Nigeria and the security agencies," Sani said. "They want an end to the government's campaign against them and for them to pull troops out of northeastern Nigeria."  Analysts believe some Boko Haram members might be tempted by payouts made by the government to militants in the Niger Delta in recent years in exchange for their laying down arms. But one attempt at mediation has already ended in disaster. In September, a leading figure in Maiduguri connected to the group who sat down for talks with a former president of Nigeria was assassinated within 48 hours. Sani helped set up the meeting; he says he has since received death threats himself.  Security analysts are concerned the group may try to target Nigeria's oil industry in the Niger Delta, destabilizing supplies from the world's eighth largest oil exporter. Over the past decade, pipelines and rigs in the area have been repeatedly targeted by the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND). The area is predominantly Christian and western intelligence sources say it would be difficult for Boko Haram to establish a presence there.  Human rights activists say for now, the authorities' crackdown in northern Nigeria may have the effect of radicalizing more Muslims. According to Sani and others tracking the group, Boko Haram has drawn its membership mainly from disaffected youngsters and unemployed graduates. But it has also gathered support among the professions.  Human Rights Watch says it has documented serious abuses by Nigerian police, including extrajudicial executions against suspected members of Boko Haram.  "The security forces are punishing people who they believe provide shelter to Boko Haram, but if you reveal the identity of Boko Haram fighters, then they'll kill you. You can see the dilemma," Sani said.  "If Nigerian government can't solve the problem, and the violence continues, then this virus will spread across the countries of west Africa and central Africa, emboldening the group and boosting its membership, making it a well-established part of al Qaeda," he said.  Today the Nigerian media, like its politicians, are full of advice to the government on how to tackle Boko Haramfrom an even tougher military response to renewed attempts at dialogue, another amnesty and a more comprehensive effort to address the root causes of the violence.  Neither carrot nor stick has worked so far.  
 Christina Pearson was half-bald at age 13. She just couldn't stop pulling her hair, and ended up taking out every lock from the tops of her ears to the crown of her head.  Trichotillomania is such a stigmatizing disorder that people will go to great length to hide it, experts say.  "It was absolutely terrifying because I was a very bright child, and doing great in school," she said. "The doctor had no idea what it was."  Pearson continued pulling her hair throughout her teens, 20s, and early 30s. It wasn't until she was 33 that she learned her condition had a name: trichotillomania. She became inspired to start an organization, called the Trichotillomania Learning Center, to help other sufferers of the disorder.  It turns out that this condition, characterized by the urge to pull hair from one's body, affects about 2 to 4 percent of the population, according to the Trichotillomania Learning Center.  A new study published this week in the Archives of General Psychiatry may hold promise for those who compulsively pull their hair. Researchers say participants who took an antioxidant called N-acetylcysteine, sold over the counter at vitamin stores, had significant improvement over patients who took placebos.  The dietary supplement used in the study is known for its benefits to the kidneys and liver, said lead author Dr. John Grant at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, who is on the advisory board of the Trichotillomania Learning Center. More recently it has been shown to affect glutamate, a chemical messenger in the brain that seems to be involved in compulsive repetitive behaviors, he said.  The sample size was small50 peoplebut the study has generated enthusiasm among trichotillomania researchers.  "This is one of the bigger advances we've had within this field in a long time," said Doug Woods, associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.  Psychologists are still debating how to categorize trichotillomania, Woods said. Many believe it is related to obsessive compulsive disorder, but others liken it to addictions or impulse control disorders.  Researchers are unsure of exactly what goes on in the brain with this disorder. Some people with trichotillomania feel pleasure in pulling hair, while others describe it as "calming," and still others have no idea why they do it, Grant said. There may be differences in the brain pathways among people with the condition, he said.  For Pearson, pulling hair up made her feel as if her whole nervous system lit up, she said.  "Basically my fingers would search for a texture, a certain type of hair, when I found it, I would pull it out," she said. "I would feel like I had found gold."  The condition affects primarily women and usually begins in childhood or adolescence, Woods said.  The term, coined in 1889 by a Greek physician, comes from the Greek words for its features: "tricho" means "hair," "till" means "to pull," and "mania" means "frenzy."  Long before the disorder had a name, the idea of compulsive hair-pulling had been known for hundreds of years, Woods said.  The two main kinds of medications that have been used for trichotillomania are selective seratonin reuptake inhibitorsSSRIs, used for depressionand the OCD drug chlorimipramine, Woods said. The antidepressants may help patients' anxiety and depression but don't actually help the pulling, whereas chlorimipramine has been shown to dampen the pulling impulse somewhat.  But the treatment that has demonstrated the most effectiveness so far is behavior therapy, Woods said.  The dietary supplement probably will not replace the need for behavioral therapy, but future research may find that they two approaches work well together, Grant said.  Before trying N-acetylcysteine, people should consult their physicians, particularly to determine whether there are interactions that the supplement could have with other medications the patient already takes, Grant said.  Experts say there are still many people who compulsively pull their hair and don't know that they are not the only ones.  Trichotillomania is such a stigmatizing disorder that people will go to great lengths to hide itto explain bald spots to acquaintances, some patients will lie and say they had cancer, Woods said.  "I have talked to patients who have pulled for 25 years, and their husbands don't even know it, they hide it so well," he said.  People with the disorder don't just pull from their headsthey also pull hair from their eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic regions, Woods said.  Living with the disease, Pearson at times felt suicidal. She dropped out of high school because she was terrified of her friends finding out.  "There was a time in my early 20s when I really, seriously considered, could I cut my hands off and live my life?" she said. "My hands were my enemies, because they pulled my hair."  To manage her condition 18 years ago, Pearson tried relaxation techniques for the situations that led to her pulling. For example, she tended to pull her hair while driving, so she bought thin leather gloves and told herself that she could not remove themor pull her hairuntil she turned the car off.  Today, there are many more strategies available to help people identify the triggers for hair-pulling and figure out the best way to control the impulses in those situations, Pearson said.  The Trichotillomania Learning Center has assisted more than 100,000 people in some way since 1991, Pearson said. The organization holds conferences, retreats, professional training sessions, and other programs to help people manage the disorder. The center also helps health care professionals learn about treating people for the condition.  "To experience the entrapment of this type of compulsion, and then to experience the freedom of living without it is a gift I wish for everyone," Pearson said.

Washington A week after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of an Ohio law that restricts early voting, Attorney General Eric Holder argued the decision will disproportionately affect African-Americans, many of whom "heavily" use early voting.  "It is a major step backward to allow these reductions to early voting to go into effect," Holder said in a video message posted Monday.  "Early voting is about much more than making it more convenient for people to exercise their civic responsibilities. It's about preserving access and openness for every eligible voter, not just those who can afford to miss work or who can afford to pay for childcare," he continued in the video, which was posted on the Justice Department's website.  The law cut down the state's 35-day early voting window by seven days.  Proponents say that reducing in-person early voting would help create uniformity across the state's counties, and voters would still be able to vote by mail during that seven-day window.  But critics argue the Republican-backed law will make it more difficult for minorities to vote.  Opinion: Why does GOP fight early voting?  While the Justice Department was not a part of the lawsuit, it filed a brief in the case in July.  A federal judge had previously said the law was unconstitutional and placed a hold on it so it couldn't go into effect. That decision was upheld by a federal appeals court judge. But the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision allowed for the law to go into effect immediately. Early voting in Ohio now official starts this week.  In his video message, Holder said early voting is "heavily used" by African-Americans because the practice is popular among people who have a hard time getting to the polls due to childcare responsibilities, hourly salaries, and reduced access to transportation.  "Restricting voting hours in ways that would disproportionately impact minority communities is not only unnecessary and unwarrantedit is out of step with our history of continually expanding the franchise," he said. "It is contrary to our fundamental values of equality, opportunity, and inclusion. And it is an affront to millions who have marched, and fought, and too often died to make real America's most basic promise."  Holder announced late last month he'll soon be resigning from his post, but will stay on until a replacement has been confirmed.  
 Manila, Philippines Fueled by seasonal monsoon rains and a nearby tropical storm, widespread flooding in the Philippines worsened Tuesday, killing at least 11 people, the national disaster agency reported.  A landslide in the Manila suburb of Quezon City buried two houses, leaving nine people dead and four others injured, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Center.  Three of the dead were children, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported.  The capital city of Manila got 504 millimeters (about 20 inches) of rain Tuesday, PNA reported, with more on the way.  The country's weather servicethe Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administrationwarned the Manila region's 12 million residents of continued torrential rains and serious flooding through Wednesday.  "It's like a water world," Benito Ramos, head of the disaster agency, said of the city, according to PNA.  The national railroad called off service, and many roads were under water. Some dams were beginning to overflow, putting more communities at risk, the authorities said.  North Koreans in desperate need of food after floods  The flooding has already forced more than 780,000 people across the country from their homes, the disaster agency said. About 242,000 were staying in emergency shelters Tuesday night, according to the agency.  Rescue requests continued to come in early Wednesday, including some people who were using Twitter to contact the authorities for help.  "Pregnant woman needs help! Staying on top of a roof," one Twitter user posted, followed by an address. "Please help BORRES FAMILY w/ 2y/o child!!," posted another.  The weather agency warned residents to expect more landslides and flash flooding, and the authorities urged residents in low-lying areas to move to higher ground.  As well as the deaths in the landslide in Quezon City, two people died from electrocution and drowning outside the Manila region, the disaster agency said early Wednesday.  Those deaths came on top of the 53 people who had already been killed across the Philippines by heavy wind and rain in the past few weeks.  In an effort to save lives and make way for rescue and relief efforts, President Benigno Aquino ordered work suspended at government and private offices around the capital region Tuesday.  Government offices and schools were also to be closed Wednesday, the president's office said.  Deep water in many parts of metropolitan Manila blocked roads, stranded cars and flooded homes. In several areas, the water was waist deep or higher, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority said in its Twitter feed.  "Last night it was raining cats and dogs, or even like elephants banging on your roof top," said CNN iReporter Rummel Pinera. "You cannot sleep when it's raining for several hours like this, it was like a deluge."  Another iReporter, Jumar Rejuso, said the downpour was terrifying.  2 tropical cyclones strike Chinese coast in quick succession  "We had to force ourselves to leave in order to be spared from the wrath of the raging waters," he said. "It was the first time I have witnessed in my entire life a flood as big as that."  Flooding has struck across the Philippines, with high water reported in 46 communities across the country, the disaster agency reported.  The authorities in Marikina City imposed a forced evacuation of areas near the Marikina River, which has risen above critical levels, PNA reported.  The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said the Ambuklao, Binga and San Roque dams were releasing water, putting several cities at a higher risk of flooding. The agency warned residents living near the dams to be on the lookout for rising waters.  U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Harry K. Thomas said Tuesday that the United States would provide $100,000 for disaster relief.  The rain and flooding are the result of the normal summer monsoon enhanced by the effects of Tropical Storm Haikui, the Philippines weather service said. The storm made landfall on the east coast of China on Wednesday morning.  The Philippines had already been lashed by heavy rain and wind in recent weeks resulting from Tropical Storm Saola, which plowed past it before hitting Taiwan and China at the end of last week.  The country is frequently subjected to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rain. In December, Tropical Storm Washi left more than 1,200 people dead after it set off flash floods that swept away entire villages in the southern Philippines.  Complete coverage of extreme weather  CNN's Alex Zolbert in Manila, and Jethro Mullen and Anjali Tsui in Hong Kong contributed to this report.

Top seed Rafael Nadal and second seed Roger Federer are both through to the quarterfinals of the Qatar Open in Doha after comfortable straight sets victories on Wednesday.  French Open champion Nadal took 90 minutes to see off fellow-left-hander Denis Gremelmayr of Germany 6-2 6-2 while Federer's 6-2 6-3 success over Slovenian Grega Zemlja was achieved in exactly and hour.  Nadal told reporters he was happy with the way he played, saying: "The worst thing I did last year was my return and I was happy with the way my return worked today.  "I also want to have enough shots not to be predictable. I want to attack the ball faster and hit with more power and spin," he added.  Both Nadal and Federer had to contend with a troublesome wind and Federer said: "I used to be very emotional when I was younger, after growing up in Switzerland where we didn't have wind that much, and where we also played indoors a lot.  "It was difficult learning how to play in the windbut I have had a lot of practice playing in windy places and it doesn't bother me any more."  Federer next faces eighth-seeded Italian Andreas Seppi, while Nadal will take on Russian Mikhail Youzhny.  Also through to the quarterfinals are third seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and fifth seed Viktor Troicki.  Top seed Andy Murray is through to the last eight of the Brisbane International event but he had to fight back from the brink of defeat for the second successive match, eventually beating Luxembourg's Gilles Muller 4-6 7-6 6-0.  The Briton next faces Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis, who dumped out fifth seed Kei Nishikori of Japan 6-3 6-4.  
 Madrid Spanish investigators are trying to figure out how a 5-month-old baby died on a baggage carousel at an airport in Alicante.  A spokeswoman for Spain's airport authority, AENA, said Thursday it's not clear how the baby ended up on the baggage belt for oversized luggage.  "The baby was on the baggage carousel, but could not have gotten there alone. Someone had to put the baby there. I don't know how the baby got there," said the airport spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified.  The infant's mother, an American woman, arrived at the airport late Wednesday on a flight from London's Gatwick airport with her baby and another young child, the spokeswoman said. The father, who is Canadian, was already there waiting at the Alicante airport, she added.  The baggage carousel is a flat, black rubber-type belt that moves only in one direction and is only activated when oversized bags are sent out on it for pickup. It's several feet long and passengers can stand on either side of it or at the receiving end, the spokeswoman said.  She said it was not immediately known if the infant was placed on the belt while it was stopped, or once it had started moving.  An unidentified security officer at the airport told CNN affiliate Atlas she didn't see the incident, but was told that "the mother apparently put (the baby) down on the conveyer belt when she went to reach for something. He was crushed by the conveyer belt and it killed him."  Airport medical personnel rushed to the scene but were unable to revive the infant, the spokeswoman said.  The Spanish Civil Guard said the baby's death appears to be an accident, but an investigation is under way.  At a loss: Comforting grieving parents  After the baby was pronounced dead, the family had to wait for a judge to arrive, by Spanish law, so that the body could be moved. Civil Guards took statements from the parents at the airport, the airport spokeswoman said.  The baggage belt for oversized luggagewhich includes infant car seats and baby strollersis at one end of a large baggage claims hall at the Alicante airport, which handles 9 million passengers a year, the spokeswoman said.  The baggage carousel is in a secure area, and passengers go through it to claim their bags before they exit into the public arrivals hall. The father of the baby would not have had access to that area, the airport spokeswoman said.  Civil Guard and National Police spokesmen confirmed the nationalities of the mother and father as American and Canadian, respectively.  A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Madrid said that U.S. Consular officials are aware of the incident and are providing assistance.  A spokeswoman for the Canadian Embassy in Madrid said she could not comment and referred inquiries to the Canadian government's Department of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa.  Spanish newspaper El Pais reported the family had come to the Alicante area, on Spain's Mediterranean coast, for vacation, but authorities would not immediately confirm that.

Mali beat Botswana 2-1 Wednesday to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinals from Group D of the competition.  Goals from Garra Dembele and Barcelona star Seydou Keita with the winner secured the runners-up spot from the group behind Ghana, who were held 1-1 by Guinea in a match played at the same time in Franceville.  It earned Mali, reaching this stage for the first time in eight years, a match against their coach Alain Giresse's former team, co-hosts Gabon.  Botswana opened the scoring in Libreville six minutes into the second half with Moemedi Moatlaping converting after a fine move.  Mali leveled after 56 minutes when Abdou Traore crossed for Dembele to volley home.  Mali substitute Ousmane Coulibaly hit the crossbar with an effort before Tidiane Cheick Diabete set up Keita to net from close range with 15 minutes left.  Blog: Does Football really need transfer windows?  The Mali players had to wait until the Ghana-Guinea game had finished to make sure they went through, at the result celebrating wildly their passage to the last eight.  Ghana, who put on the best showing of an African side at the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, have earned a quarterfinal match against Tunisia.  The Black Stars went ahead in the 28th minute through Emmanuel Badu with a blistering shot from outside the area.  But Abdoul Razzagui Camara drew Guinea deservedly level in first half stoppage time.  Guinea were reduced to 10 men in the second half after Bah Dioulde was sent off after being booked for a second time on 70 minutes.  
 A Mississippi woman whose death sentence was overturned has been moved from state prison to county jail, where she will await a new trial, authorities say.  Michelle Byrom was moved to Tishomingo County Jail on Saturday. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed her capital murder conviction on March 31 and ordered a new trial.  Byrom was sentenced to death in 2000 after a jury determined she was the mastermind of a murder-for-hire plot to kill her allegedly abusive husband. Her son wrote in jailhouse letters that he committed the crime, and according to court documents, told a court-appointed psychologist that he was culprit.  According to Tishomingo County Sheriff Glenn Whitlock, Byrom was picked up by sheriff officials Saturday morning and is being held under the original capital murder indictment until the county district attorney or court system takes the next steps.  Whitlock told CNN that Byrom isn't receiving any special treatment, and she is currently alone in her cell, but could have cellmates at any time.  Byrom's new trial date has not been set yet, according to the Tishomingo County Circuit clerk.  The attorney who represented Byrom during the effort to have her conviction reversed no longer represents the 57-year-old. Efforts to reach her new counsel were not immediately successful.

 Los Angeles Juanita Moore, the third African-American actress to ever get a supporting actress Oscar nomination, died of natural causes at her Los Angeles home Tuesday, her grandson said. She was 99.  Moore worked right to the end, preparing for a stage reading of a new play and helping her actor grandson learn lines, Kirk Kellykhan said,  "I just got cursed out that morning about learning my lines," Kellykhan said. Moore was helping him prepare for the lead in the West Coast production of the Broadway play "The Wedding Man," he said.  She was scheduled to take part in a January 17 reading of a play based on Michael St. John's book "Hollywood Through the Backdoor," her grandson said.  Moore was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar in 1960 for Douglas Sirk's "Imitation of Life." She played a housekeeper whose daughter passes for white.  A Los Angeles native, she began her entertainment career as a Cotton Club chorus girl and a film extra. At the same time, she worked on her acting skills on stage in the Ebony Showcase Theater.  Moore's feature film debut came in 1949 when she played a nurse in "Pinky."  Most of her roles in the 1950s were as domestics, until she was cast as Annie Johnson in "Imitation of Life." The story was about Johnson's light-skinned daughter denying her racial roots.  The lack of roles for African-American actresses in the early 1960s made it difficult for Moore to find big-screen jobs despite the accolades for her work. She acted in supporting roles in 1961 in "Tammy, Tell Me True" and in 1963 in "Papa's Delicate Condition." Moore did land a significant role as a nun in the 1966 hit "The Singing Nun."  As more black-themed movies were made near the end of the decade, her career improved. She acted in "Uptight" in 1968, "The Mack" in 1973 and "Abby" in 1974.  While she cut back on acting work in the 1980s, she never retired. She played a wise grandmother in "Disney's The Kid" in 2000, while acting in television guest roles in "ER" and "Judging Amy."

NEW YORK  When filmmaker Roman Polanski was arrested Saturday in Switzerland, he was on his way to accept an award for Lifetime Achievement at the Zurich Film Festival.  Peers of Roman Polanski have praised him for his talent and lamented his arrest.  Polanski's friend, Swiss filmmaker Otto Weisser, was among the first to publicly run to his defense.  "This is for me a shock. I am ashamed to be Swiss, that the Swiss is doing such a thing to brilliant fantastic genius, that millions and millions of people love his work," Weisser said upon learning the director had been detained by Swiss authorities. "He's a brilliant guy, and he made a little mistake 32 years ago. What a shame for Switzerland."  By Tuesday, more than 130 heavyweights in the movie industry had taken up Polanski's cause.  An online petition has been signed by directors such as Marin Scorsese, Woody Allen and Pedro Almodovar, as well as actors.  Studio chief Harvey Weinstein told CNN in a statement: "We are calling every filmmaker we can to help fix this terrible situation."  Watch a report on celebrities' feelings about Polanski's arrest   Roman Polanski first stormed Hollywood with his psychological thriller, "Rosemary's Baby," in 1968. He remains one of the most celebrated directors in Hollywood and the world, despite not having set foot in the United States in more than three decades.  "We stand by and await his release and his next masterwork," said Zurich Film Festival Jury President Debra Winger on Monday on behalf of Polanski.  Adrien Brody, who Polanski directed in 2002's "The Pianist," had glowing words when it came to his experience working with Polanski.  "If you have the guidance from someone you admire, like Roman Polanski, who not only is a gifted director and actor, but who knows the subject matter and in my opinion the character that I portray, implicitly, then, it's a huge gift," Brody said.  "I learned a great deal about film and the process," the Academy Award winning actor added. "I spent six weeks without another actor on the set, just Roman and I and a crewand that's, that's a dream come true for an actor. I cherished those memories."  "He is sweet and very strong and is very, very demanding, in the tradition of an auteur," said Sigourney Weaver about being directed by Polanski in 1994's "Death and the Maiden."  It's a reputation Polanski's earned and maintained, despite his 1977 guilty plea on a statutory rape charge of unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl.  Watch the mixed reaction in Switzerland to Polanski's arrest   The celebrated director fled the United States and settled in France to escape jail, but by the standards of those in Hollywood, the case is ancient history.  "We hope today that this latest order will be dropped," Winger said. "It is based on a three decade old case that is all but dead, except for a minor technicality."  Matthew Belloni, who has has been following the Polanski case for The Hollywood Reporter's  legal blog, said the outpouring of support from the film industry is not surprising.  "It is a criminal conviction of a terrible crime, but it is something that the industry is willing to look the other way on," Belloni said. "If Hollywood really gets to look at itself and judge the personal character of a lot of the artists in the community, there would be a lot of empty seats at the Oscars because a lot of people have personal problems. This sort of is at the extreme level of that."  As Polanski's star rose after his Oscar-winning hit, "Rosemary's Baby," the world got to know the director's back story.  He was the son of Polish Jews whose mother died in a concentration camp even as a young Polanski escaped the Nazis.  Polanski grew up to become a famous director and married  actress Sharon Tate. He later became the object of national sympathy when Tate was murdered by the Charles Manson Family in 1969.  His next big movie, 1974's "Chinatown," was nominated for 11 Oscars. That success gave Hollywood its heroic tag line for Polanski: Tragic survivor moves on.  Actors from his films said they have felt a certain empathy as they are directed by him.  "Roman was one of those poor Krakow ghetto children who had to hide in the latrine," said Sir Ben Kingsley, who starred with Weaver in "Death and the Maiden."  Brody hailed Polanski for his survival, even in the face of being separated from his parents and losing his mother at Auschwitz.  "He survived alone, basically, in hiding," Brody said. "It's one of the many things I feel he's overcome, and what's wonderful about Roman is that although he's experienced some tragic things in his life, he also has this unbroken spirit."  After the rape case, American authorities sought his arrest, but he continued to work around the world on movies such as "Tess" and "The Ninth Gate," traveling to film festivals and movie sets.  But it was in 2002 when Polanski rocketed back onto the public stage, with "The Pianist."  The Holocaust film won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, igniting a buzz culminating in three Oscars in 2003, including best actor for Brody and best director for Polanski. Harrison Ford accepted the award in his absence. The crowd at the Kodak Theater roared.  The Hollywood Reporter's Belloni explained Hollywood's readiness to forgive. "Look at some of the people who have been involved with scandals," Belloni said. "  "Everyone from Michael Vick, who is now playing football again, to Mel Gibson, who has been involved in a lot of scandals, now he's working again. America is a very, very forgiving culture, and Hollywood itself. If you are a talent, the industry is willing in many ways to look the other way."  And the industry isn't alone in wanting to put the past aside.  Polanski's victim, Samantha Geimer, told CNN's Larry King in 2003 that she wished the story and the case had ended soon after it began three decades ago.  "The publicity was so traumatic and so horrible his punishment was secondary to just getting this whole thing to stop," Geimer said. "It was crazy. I never wanted him to go to jail."  
 (OPRAH.com)Susan: Kathryn walks through the door of the restaurant, just like the first time we met. Her arms akimbo, reeling off her story. Why she's late. Why she's angry at someone I don't know. What her son has to write for English class. Why her other son's social studies teacher doesn't understand him.  Her husband. Her cousin. Her brother. Her audition. Her life writ large. In the telling. As large as her holiday dinners, her novel, her unfinished lists, her outrage at the world's ills, her embrace, her laugh at her own expense.  She's invited me to lunch to celebrate my Guggenheim fellowship, but 15 minutes in she has not stopped talking. Finally, I must speak.  "Who would you be without your narrative?" I wonder. It stops her cold.  Possessed, she gets up without a word. Walks out of the restaurant, comes back in, and starts over. This time she raises her coffee cup.  "To you!" she says. And turns it overthe morning, the reason we're here, the dialogue. We change direction and revise.  Why are we friends? This is why.  Oprah.com: Are you a good (or bad) friend?  Kathryn: I pretty much never fail to remind my friend Suz that we first met in our late 20s when I auditioned for a play of hers in which she made the fatal decision not to cast me.  Here is who I remember we were at the beginning. Cute. Very cute girls. No doubts on her part that she was the real deal, an honest-to-God, daring, one-of-a-kind playwright. No doubts on mine that I was a born thespian with unique comedic gifts.  No doubts that everything was indeed going to come up roses, because our parents told us so. I have no other friend who was so equally adored by her parents and no other friend who grasps so completely how shocked I still am that the world did not stop spinning to welcome me to it.  Oprah.com: Oprah and Gayle, uncensored  Susan: Do you know you never looked at my scar? After my mastectomy, I asked you if you wanted to see it and you said you weren't ready.  Kathryn: I had no memory of this moment and was instantly ashamed, even 24 years later, at the thought that my friend could have survived this loss and that I was too frightened to even acknowledge it.  Until I realized that what I knew all those years ago was that I couldn't imagine my life without her in it, and looking at that scar would have brought me too close to the possibility that I might have lost her at our very beginning.  Kathryn: What's worse than not looking at your scar is the fight we had on the corner.  Susan: Well, not a fight.  Kathryn: A large disagreeing. A taking to task.  Susan: Okay. It felt like a fight.  Kathryn: I wanted you to move on. Stop being stuck in regret or sorrow. I didn't want you to waste time on what people didn't give you or how people weren't honoring you appropriately.  Susan: That's you! You are talking about yourself. You can't tolerate my Kathryn: Because I completely identify.  Susan: I was going to saydarkness. You can't tolerate my pain and worry over my son's pain and worry. You don't stop and let the other person's world take space. You're too wrapped up in your own circumstance. You who are totally uncontrollable in your panic at any disruption of your own family. That's what the fight was about for me.  Kathryn: I want us to live like we have two minutes left.  Susan: Okay. But then you'll have to stop talking.  Oprah.com: 5 friends every woman should have  Kathryn: I don't think I've ever spent time with you without bursting out in great guffaws. Even after sobbing.  Susan: That makes me want to cry.  Kathryn: You have this burst laughter, this relish of laughter. I love hearing you laugh. I love making you laugh. I love laughing with you. I can count on you for laughter.  Susan: We help each other get over ourselves.  Kathryn: Here are some boldfaced differences in who we are. Suz is delicate. She is a tiny thing and I can practically circle her wrist twice with my comparatively enormous hand. She is delicate inside and out, and I am a Russian peasant.  She has one breast. I have two (knock knock). She was married to her high school sweetheart for ten years, had intense love affairs, and has been with Lida for ten. I have been married (so far) to the same husband for 26 years. She has never been fat.  Susan: Once, when I was 11.  Oprah.com: Julie Powell meets the Wine Divas  Kathryn: Can you remember the longest period that we haven't talked to each other?  Susan: A week?  Kathryn: If a week's gone by, I start to think, "Are we in one of those places where you need to tell me something?"  Susan: And I think, "What don't you want to tell me?"  Oprah.com: How to cope with the loss of a best friend  Susan and Kathryn: Sometimes it's not wanting to be so intimately observed. To be caught. Because we're onto each other.  As many times as we vow there's nothing that could rend us asunder, still the anxious space between when something bothers us and when we express it to each other is enormous and scary.  We both have permission to be anything, to say anything. We know each other's fragile places. And are tender with them.  Kathryn: You're one of the few friends, Suz, whom I walk arm in arm with. We don't do it always, but sometimes. And I think the only other woman I've done that with is my mom.  Susan: So what's the future of us?  Kathryn: That you finish three or maybe five more fabulous plays. That I get to be in each and every one of them. That we dance at our grandchildren's weddings.  That we wake up joyful and actually sleep through part of the night. And that we get to become the two older women we can't believe we'll be.

And I didn't think Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo! chief who caused quite a stir with her two-week maternity leave and decision to ban employees working from home, could get any more controversial.  Enter her decision to strike a pose in the September issue of Vogue magazine, lounging on a hammock wearing Michael Kors and stiletto heels, and let the debate, mostly among women, rage on.  "Smart women can be beautiful," said Jen Bosse of the blog, Defining My Happy. "Beautiful women can be leaders of industry. Women should not have to succumb to societal pressure dictating what they are 'allowed' to be and do."  I happen to agree with Jen's sentiment, but other women saw Mayer's pose as a step backward.  "We fight so hard to be where we are and prove that it wasn't our cute bodies, perky boobs or cute face that got us there," said self-described "pretty geek," Anna Nicole Moose, in response to a request for comment on CNN's Facebook page. "Shame on you Marissa Mayer for playing into stereotypes."  But can't a woman be powerful, strong and beautiful, all at once? That question drew a range of responses from women on various rungs of the corporate ladder, some supportive of Mayer embracing her femininity and others lamenting the undue pressure on female leaders to soften their image.  Yahoo's Marissa Mayer turns heads with Vogue photo shoot  For many women, the fact that there's even a debate about Mayer's decision to do the Vogue photo shoot in the first place shows that a double standard is alive and well.  "Why are women always being held to a different level of scrutiny in the business and tech space?" said Carolyn Gerin, senior editor of Destination I Do Magazine. "So what if Marissa Meyer loves fashion? Would we think less of Larry Ellison being photographed with his monster boat ... or Richard Branson with his hot air balloons?"  Cali Williams Yost, author of the book "Tweak It: Make What Matters to You Happen Every Day," said, "My hope is that someday we're not batting an eye at CEO women being in Vogue, as we don't bat an eye on CEO men being in Outside magazine talking about how they climbed Mount Kilimanjaro."  Marissa Mayer: From Google 'geek' to Yahoo CEO  Patrice Grell Yursik, creator of a beauty, fashion and lifestyle site for women of color called Afrobella.com, believes Mayer has the right to present herself any way she sees fit, but says sadly, mainstream media showcases women and men differently.  "I can't think of the last time a men's magazine chose to profile a CEO by asking him to sprawl out on a couch," she said. "When, let's say, GQ or Esquire is profiling someone on this level, they're not asking them to unbutton their shirt and pose suggestively with any kinds of props."  The response from Mayer's fellow female CEOs and female executives was also telling.  Barbara O., who only wanted to use her first name and initial of her last name, is a chief marketing officer who worked in the tech industry at companies ranging from Apple to Netscape to Yahoo!. Her position isn't one based on sexism, she says, but on her views about the best way for a CEO to benefit his or her company.  How Marissa Mayer writes her own rules  "The pose that Marissa took for ... Vogue is not one that a man would take or that seems to be beneficial for Yahoo!," she said in response to a post on CNN's Facebook page. "I am fine with her using her good looks or her smarts or her role as a CEO and mother to help folks take a new look at Yahoo!. However, this Vogue (photo) looks to be much more about Marissa being sexy as a woman rather than Marissa looking great as CEO of a company desperately trying to remain relevant."  Grace Chan, vice president for product management for Wanderful Media, said she wouldn't have posed for Vogue as an executive.  "This is something I wouldn't personally do because I believe if you want to be treated equal, you shouldn't take advantage of your physical assets," said Chan. "I don't want to get brownie points because I am attractive. I like to separate the fact that I am a woman and I am a professional."  Other women in leadership positions said they saw no problem with Mayer showing a different side of her personality.  "So what if Marissa Mayer is in a fashion spread in Vogue?" said Mary Cook, CEO of CallSocket.com. "When she 'took office' did she also park her sense of fashion, personal interests, and humor at the front door? I hope she had fun on the photo shoot and she looks great to boot!"  For some women, the issue is not what Mayer did but what she said.  In the Vogue article, the Yahoo! CEO said she didn't set out to lead technology companies. "I'm just geeky and shy and I like to code. ... It's not like I had a grand plan where I weighed all the pros and cons of what I wanted to doit just sort of happened," she told the magazine.  "You don't become a female CEO of a tech company for just stumbling onto a career, and you certainly don't end up in Vogue for those reasons either," said Hayley Krischer, a writer of the feminist blog, Femamom, and mom of two. "Mayer has embraced all of her horrible work ethics ... putting a kabosh on the work-from-home environment so why not embrace her aggressive side and tell the truth about who she is?"  If Marissa Mayer can 'have it all,' can you?  In the midst of all the back and forth were questions from some women about why we women are often ripping each other apart. After all, women have been some of the loudest critics of Mayer.  "She's not doing a spread in Playboy," said Micky Marie Morrison, author of "Baby Weight." "It's not at all inappropriate. What's inappropriate is judging her."  Nicole Williams, LinkedIn's career expert, said, "The thought that women can be glamorous, beautiful and successful is really difficult for women to embrace because I think in large part it's hard. It's really hard to be all those things at once and it feels kind of threatening."  Follow Kelly Wallace on Twitter and like CNN Living on Facebook.  
 South Africa's World Cup dream is hanging by a thread after Uruguay took a firm grip on Group A with a ruthless 3-0 win over the hosts.  Diego Forlan gave the South American side a first half lead after his shot deflected off Aaron Mokoena and into the net.  South Africa pushed forward in the second half but their hopes were dashed when Uruguay striker Luis Suarez was brought down in the penalty area by goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, who was sent off.  Forlan converted the resulting penalty past substitute 'keeper Moeneeb Josephs to kill the hosts off and send many South Africa fans heading for the exits.  Alvaro Pereira converted a late third as South Africa desperately tried to salvage something from the game.  Uruguay go top of Group A with four points from their two games. South Africa have a solitary point after two games, and must beat France in their final game to have any hope of progressing to the knock out stages.  The hosts had gone into the game buoyed by their opening day draw with Mexico and riding a wave of emotion after the country enthusiastically embraced the first ever World Cup held on African soil.  Group A was delicately poised after all four teams drew their opening game and it was Uruguay who started the more positively, striker Luis Suarez shooting wide after just seven minutes.  On 20 minutes Forlan broke the deadlock. Picking the ball up in midfield the Atletico Madrid forward surged towards the edge of the penalty area before unleashing a fierce drive on goal. The ball took a touch off Mokoena and dipped under the crossbar.  South Africa struggled to retain possession as Uruguay pushed forward but the game reached the interval with no further scoring.  The hosts played with more urgency after the break but couldn't unearth a chance before the game's decisive passage of play.  On 75 minutes Suarez picked up a loose ball in the area before being clipped by Khune's leg. The referee pointed to the penalty spot and showed the goalkeeper a straight red card.  Forlan slotted the penalty into the roof of the net to take the stuffing out of South Africa and as coach Carlos Alberto Parreira's ten men edged forward in search of a goal Uruguay killed them off.  Suarez collected Forlan's long pass before crossing for Pereira to bundle the ball home and put the game beyond doubt, right on the final whistle.  Group A's other teamsFrance and Mexicoplay on Thursday night in Polokwane. South Africa's final game is against France on Tuesday.

The mystery winner of a New York lottery ticket worth $1 million has until Sunday to claim the prize, or the money will return to a pool for future winners, according to state lottery officials.  The winning lottery ticket was purchased at the Playland Market in Rye on August 25, 2012. According to New York Gaming Commission rules, winners have up to one year to claim their prize. New York Lottery officials have been urging players to check their tickets for the winning numbers: 1-6-7-20-49, Powerball 23, and come forward before the ticket expires.  "We're hopeful the lucky winner has already signed the ticket and is making plans to claim it before it's too late," said Gardner Gurney, acting director of the Division of the Lottery.  The New York Gaming Commission uses all means possible to get the word out when it is presented with an unclaimed prize, including news media and social media, said Christy Calicchia, spokesperson for the commission.  Sandy victims among the 'Ocean's 16' Powerball winners  To claim the money, the winner must present the ticket at any one of New York's seven customer service centers during business hours. Since the one-year anniversary of the ticket's purchase falls on a Sunday, the winner would technically need to have presented the ticket by the close of business Friday, said Calicchia.  It is unclear how the situation would be handled if the ticket were to be turned in on Monday, she said.  Lottery winners may also turn in winning tickets by mail. As long as the ticket is postmarked by August 25, it will be deemed valid. The gaming commission will be monitoring incoming mail to see if the ticket turns up, Calicchia said.  New York state has seen several prizes go unclaimed, the largest of which was drawn more than a decade ago.  In 2002, the owner of a winning ticket sold in Brooklyn never came forward to collect the $68 million prize. It remains the highest jackpot to go unclaimed in New York Lottery history. The next year, a ticket in Brooklyn went unclaimed again, this time for a jackpot of $46 million.  Winnings can go unclaimed for a variety of reasons, Calicchia said, noting sometimes tickets or lost or become unreadable after being left in a pocket and washed. She said many tickets are unclaimed because winners don't notice they scored with smaller, tiered prizes in lottery jackpots.  "Most people don't realize that there is more than one prize in the lottery drawing," she said.  Rye is in Westchester County and is about 30 miles north of New York City.  The New York Gaming Commission regulates all aspects of gaming and gambling activity in New York state, including horse racing, charitable gaming and the state lottery.

 It was a remark that launched a media firestorm. Should it have?  In the midst of praising California Attorney General Kamala Harris on Thursday, President Barack Obama described her as "by far the best-looking" AG of all.  By Friday, the uproar over the remark was such that the president called Harris to apologize for the "distraction created by the comments," according to his spokesman, Jay Carney.  CNN.com readers were sharply divided over whether such an apology was warranted. Some drew on their own personal experiences with such incidents.  Commenter Lulany said that she is often "annoyed" at the focus on women's appearance that she observes day to day, but that the president did not commit a foul here.  "It's a comment you often hear from men to point out that a woman is more pleasant to the eye. I don't see much harm in that especially coming from a man who is surrounded by strong women and clearly has the highest respect for them."  James Pfeiffer mentioned how, one day, he was complimented on his "beautiful hair" by a woman in the parking lot of a golf course.  "I was speechless. But you know, it really made a 65-year-old guy feel pretty good."  He said the "politicization" of such remarks would mean "soon we'll all be just staring dumbly at one another from the fear of saying something wrong."  But what about incidents at the workplace?  "Consider this: You are at work and you tell your co-worker, 'By the way, you are the best looking co-worker here,'" said commenter "Me Not You."  "Could you be in the HR office by the end of the day? I think so."  Commenter "Person of Interest" recalled telling a female co-worker that her new haircut brought out her eyes.  "Next thing I know, I hear about how I was being inappropriate and hitting on her," he explained.  "When I asked her about it, she said she didn't think I was and in fact she was happy all day long that at least one man noticed it. A few weeks later, she complimented my girlfriend about how sweet I am to notice things like that. My girlfriend agreed."  Another commenter, "pmn," said that she went through a very similar experience to that of Harris, being introduced as a new employee.  "One of the male executives announced that she is definitely good-looking compared to a past employee," she said.  "So inappropriate. I turned completely red and felt very awkward."  And "jon" commented that remarks like that are banned from his workplace.  Paul Hogue, who stated that he supported the president, found the comment out of line, imagining if the scenario were slightly different.  "I don't recall a president commenting on how rugged their vice president looks, specifically because it detracts from the reason they are hired."  "Really?" also commented by imagining that the tables had been turned somewhat.  "What would the response have been if a female politician with tremendous power had remarked that a male politician with less power was the 'best-looking so and so'?"  They added that ultimately, it comes down to the context and setting.  "If a comment like this is made between close friends, no big dealalthough the time and place the comment is made could be questioned since others may not know that it is a comment between friends. If a comment like this is made between people that are only meeting recently, or for the first time, in this type of forumnot appropriate at all, regardless of political affiliation and/or position of power."

A man who roasted his pet dog to enjoy as a meal with his family and friends escaped prosecution after authorities in New Zealand determined the animal was killed humanely.  Auckland SPCA officers found the charred body of a Staffordshire terrier cooking in this barbecue pit.  "We were in a dilemma at seeing something we were fairly upset aboutbut being in a position of being able to do absolutely nothing about it," said Garth Halliday, of the Auckland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, on Monday.  The SPCAwhich investigates acts of animal cruelty and presses chargesresponded to the house in Mangere, south of Auckland.  There, officers found the charred body of a Staffordshire terrier cooking in a barbecue pit.  Watch why owner made decision   "They had had the dog for a while, but the man told us his wife was getting tired of the dog. He was becoming a pest," Halliday said.  "They decided to get rid of him. But instead of bringing him to the SPCAwhich we recommendthey decided to have a meal, and cook and eat him."  The family is from Tonga where eating a dog is not uncommon, Halliday said.  "He didn't think he was doing anything wrong," he said. Is eating dog meat acceptable? Sound Off below  The incident occurred in February. For the next few months, the SPCA looked into whether the man ought to be charged for the killing. Over the weekend, the organization decided it couldn't because the animal had been killed humanely.  The man, Halliday said, struck the dog in the head with a hammer, rendering it unconscious. He then slit its throat.  "That is the normal wayif one can use that wordthat animals are killed all over the world," Halliday said.  And under New Zealand's Animal Welfare Act, it is legal to kill an animal if it is slaughtered swiftly and painlessly.  Dr Malakai Koloamatangi, a Tongan cultural expert from the University of Canterbury, told CNN affiliate TVNZ that dog meat is a delicacy enjoyed mostly by young men in his homeland.  Still, the case infuriated and repulsed many New Zealanders.  "It's appalling," said Gracie Williams of Auckland. "As an animal lover, I am sickened. The law needs to be changed."  Auckland Mayor John Banks, an animal rights activist, told reporters that rather than a new law, what is needed is better education of local customs.  In the end, the SPCA closed the case without charges.  "We talked to the people. We told them that although it's not against the law, it is against the general culture of the country to actually kill and eat your own pet dog," Halliday said.  
 Could another deep water- or even shallow water- oil drilling disaster be looming ahead? Experts warn it certainly could happen again.  The Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, they say, highlights flaws in the drilling industry's main defense against oil and gas explosionsthe blowout preventer, which is supposed to shut down an oil and gas well if something goes wrong. Oil companies have treated such devices as virtually fail-safe.  "They're certainly not fail-safe because they didn't close this well," said Paul Bommer, a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin. "If they had been 100 percent fail-safe they would have sealed, they would have closed.,"  There have been numerous rig blowouts, including a large gusher in the Timor Sea off the coast of Western Australia last year. And a growing number of blowouts in the past decade have caused offshore oil drilling to become sloppier.  Seventy-two spills dumped 18,000 barrels of oil into U.S. federal waters from 2000-2009, while only 15 spills put 2,000 barrels into the water during the prior decade, according to data compiled by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Interior Department, which regulates energy exploration (The database excludes spills of less than 50 barrels).  Avoiding such spills depends upon the reliability of the blowout preventer, which is essentially a faucet on top of the oil well that keeps oil and gas from gushing to the surface. Rig workers use the preventer to keep a well under control, especially when oil and gas surge, or "kick up," from a well.  When its valves don't do the job, the blowout preventer can choke off the drilling pipelike squeezing a straw while drinking. And, If that fails to work, a blowout preventer has yet another line of defensehuge shear rams, like giant scissors that are supposed to be able to cut and seal the drilling pipe. But, a mile underwater, where the pressure is intense, drill pipes need to be thick, especially the joints between them. And those joints are very hard to cut.  "There are some parts of the pipe that the shears were never meant to cut," said Ford Brett, an expert in petroleum project management who is advising the Interior Department's oil drilling safety review.  "No one's equipment will shear the drill collar body. That's a lot of metal. It's not going to be possible to shear certain things," added Benton Baugh, another advisor to Interior's review of the Deepwater incident and president of Radoil, which designs and manufactures oilfield and subsea drilling equipment.  A 2002 study for the Minerals Management Service warned of such trouble in shearing drilling pipe deep underwater. Initial research painted "a grim picture of the probability of success when utilizing this final tool in securing a well," wrote consultant West Engineering Services. West Engineering would not comment to CNN on its studies for the government.  "The blowout preventers had a probability of failing to crush that pipe that approaches 50 percent," said Robert Bea, engineering professor and expert in ocean engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, who is familiar with the study. "It would be like getting on an airplane having a 50 percent chance of making it to your destination."  Based on 55 years of engineering experience, including a stint as chief offshore engineer for Shell, Bea warned government investigators that blowout preventers are not reliable in the deep sea, and he worries they could fail in the Arctic, where the industry is pursuing energy resources.  "You can keep on pushing equipment to the point of where it breaks, and I think we broke it," he said. "All of the drilling operations underway of this nature in the world today depend on these devices as the final line of defense."  In the harshest of environments, a mile underwater or in the Arctic tundra, blowout preventers operate under great stress, increasing their potential vulnerability to wear and tear.  "It is a mechanical piece of equipment. It is utilized in harsh environments. Yes, it can wear out," said Steve Sears, chairman of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Louisiana State University.  In fact, BP told congressional investigators there were several leaks in the hydraulic system that was supposed to power the shear rams of the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventer.  "It was a coupling that had not been tightened down adequately. It was several turns loose," said a person with knowledge of the investigation. BP officials also discovered a dead battery.  The final safety switch for a blowout preventer that has lost communication with its oil rig is the "deadman" system that's supposed to trigger the blowout preventer to shut the well. It did not activate during BP's April 20 rig explosion.  Another study West Engineering Services prepared for the Minerals Management System in 2003 found flaws with the deadman system.  "The most serious drawback to this system ... is the mind set of the rig personnel. Many operator and contractor personnel refuse to arm the system from fear that it will either not operate when needed or activate inappropriately, causing downtime," the report said.  Such downtime can be extremely costly. If the blowout preventer cuts through drilling pipe it can easily cost $10 million to replace that section of pipe and put the rig back into production, said Baugh.  Given the multiple problems with blowout preventers, energy experts concede the oil industry must quickly raise its safety bar.  "We must improve the safety systems of blowout preventers. Obviously it's time to take it to the next level," said Baugh. "There are more strenuous conditions occurring and we must have more strenuous solutions for them."  The Interior Department, facing the reality of energy drilling dangers, is working to toughen rules for offshore oil exploration.  "We must ensure that offshore drilling is conducted safely and in compliance with the law," said Interior Secretary Ken Salazar.  Drilling operations not subject to the administration's six-month deepwater drilling moratorium have until the end of the month to: Provide independent third party verification of the safety and effectiveness of blowout preventers, Install a secondary control system for subsea blowout preventers (current regulations do not require such a backup), and Adhere to new inspection and reporting requirements for blowout preventers.  By September the Interior Department intends to require blowout preventers to have two sets of shear rams spaced at least four feet apart in case a drill pipe joint is in front of a shear during an emergency.  The Interior Department says such steps will "increase the safety in offshore oil and gas development," but concedes they "represent only the beginning of the department's work."

 Amidst reports that the Samsung may be touting inflated numbers for sales of its Galaxy Tab tabletand reports that those that do buy the device are returning it at an alarming rateone might jump to the conclusion that Apple has little to be worried about in the way of competitors to its iPad.  However, that would be a mistake.  While Apple sold nearly 15 million iPads in 2010 and closed the year with 75% market share in the tablet space, that was down from 95% in the third quarter of 2010, before the Galaxy Tab went on sale.  And regardless of whether or not the Galaxy Tab is a hit or a dudSamsung claims its return rate is actually 2%a slew of better Android devices are about to invade the marketnot to mention offerings from other players including RIM and Palm.  One advantage that upcoming tablets like the Motorola Xoom have on the Galaxy Tab is that they'll be using Honeycomb, Google's operating system that's optimized for tablets that was officially revealed on Wednesday.  Believe it or not, the Galaxy tablet is running an older version of Android that's designed to run on smartphones, which essentially renders the device as an awkwardly sized Galaxy S.  Also, let us not forget recent history. It was less than two years ago that pundits were beginning to suggest that Android was a failure. At the time, there were only two Android smartphones on the market, despite the dozens of partners that Google had announced at the launch of Android in late 2007.  To many, the features of the nascent operating system also seemed underwhelming.  Fast forward to today and Android smartphones are outselling iPhones, thanks to the multitude of manufacturers now offering devices at a variety of price pointsall the way down to free.  Gizmodo says: "If you consider where Android was when it started versus how far it's advanced in 18 months with Android 2.2, you might get brain freeze."  All of which should signal that the tablet race is far from over.  The next few months will see not only the introduction of the Xoom, but also devices from manufacturers like LG, Vizio and Acer.  Much like smartphones, having more than one manufacturer to choose from is one of Android's big advantages, as each device offers its own unique features that consumers can weigh when making their selection.  That's no different in tablets, where consumers will be able to choose based on things like operating system, screen size and front-facing cameras, not to mention price.  And price could ultimately prove a huge driver of sales of iPad alternatives. Whereas Apple and its carrier partners, AT&T and Verizon, have thus far offered data plans for the iPad on a month-to-month basis, T-Mobile is enticing customers with a $249 retail price when you sign a two-year data contract for the Galaxy Tab.  While the contract-less iPad has its advantages, namely the ability to switch devices more than every two years, it also means you'll need to drop at least $629 initially to get a 3G version of the tablet.  Meanwhile, much like we saw with netbooks, pricing is likely to drop furtherperhaps all the way to freeas carriers look to lock in customers on their expensive new 4G data networks and manufacturers churn out devices with lower manufacturing costssomething Vizio, for example, does well.  An iPad 2 (very likely) and subsidized pricing (less likely) could give Apple another pop in the middle of this year, but make no mistake: The same tides that lifted Android past iOS in the smartphone world will soon do the same with tablets.  That's not to say that Apple won't continue to build a huge, lucrative and ever-growing market for itself, but rather to point out the inevitability of its competitors also cashing in on the tablet craze.

 I'm really not sure how I feel about the color purple. It's elegant and regal, but part of me also wants it to die in a ditch.  No offense to our mountain majesties or eggplants. But, really, purple is kind of a confused, soulless color that, deep down, wishes it was blue, yet can't shake the fact that somewhere down on the family tree one of its relatives had hot, unprotected color sex with red.  "I shall not deny my feelings for you."  "That's great, Blue. But what's with the leather chaps?"  Love it or hate it, get used to it. Purple is going to be big in 2014, at least according to our color overlords at the Pantone corporation who recently announced the upcoming color of the year: Radiant Orchid.  With its "enchanting harmony of fuchsia, purple and pink undertones," Radiant Orchid actually seems rather zen and peaceful. But it also sounds exotic and, dare I say, mildly hallucinagenic.  Trust me, someone at CU-Boulder will find a way to smoke this color.  Now, if it all seems a little weird to youthe fact that there even exists a color of the yearunderstand that Pantone, headquartered in Carlstadt, New Jersey, heralds itself as "the global color authority and provider of professional color standards for the design industry."  Basically, the company name has become synonymous worldwide with color language and communication. That means a designer in Denmark can say to a manufacturer in Pittsburgh, "We want all of our widgets to be Pantone Winter Booger" and they'll both know exactly what that looks like.  That's assuming Winter Booger is actually a shade of green in Pantone's official palette. If it's not, it should be.  I have several samples under my desk.  Regardless, Pantone 18-3224, Radiant Orchid, is apparently the big color for next year.  And why? Because they said so.  Granted, there's a lot of research that goes into this big decision, for choosing a color of the year is slightly more involved than just asking your buddy, Dave, to decide.  "Orange."  "Can you be more specific, Dave?"  "You know, like an orange."  It has to be bigger than that. After all, this is the one color that will supposedly express "what is taking place in the global zeitgeist"  Thus, to finally crown Radiant Orchid, Pantone searched the world over for design and color influences, pulling ideas from entertainment to technology. And, in the end, viewing the planet as one big global community, they decided, "Welp, this is sorta where we're at."  Purple.  Of course, Radiant Orchid marks is a drastic departure from 2013's wild and daring color of the year, Pantone 17-5641 Emerald. Which, I submit, looks astonishingly close to Winter Booger.  Perhaps as a return to civility, Radiant Orchid appears somewhat closer to 2012's color of the year, Pantone 17-1463 Tangerine Tango.  "Can you be more specific, Dave?"  "You know, like a tangerine tango."  Really, I have no idea what the hell any of this means. But, especially to those in the design community, it matters. And, somehow, as a brand, Pantone has actually become culturally iconic. At least in certain circles.  In fact, now you can literally buy accessories like mugs and iPhone cases that are intentionally designed to look like a Pantone color swatch.  It's sort of like getting your favorite element from the periodic table printed on something because, damn it, you love Boron.  But, Pantone merchandise, in a way, actually makes sense. I mean, why not express and represent yourself with a color. Perhaps asking one's Pantone will even become a part of our lexicon.  "Hey man, what's your Pantone?"  "Oh, I'm not wearing pants today."  So, in 2014 keep an eye out for purple. From fashion runways to websites to living rooms, Radiant Orchid is going to be everywhere. That, and Winter Booger.  Well, maybe not everywhere. But definitely under my desk.  Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.

Freetown, Sierra Leone I started working at the Ebola treatment center the day it opened, September 19. I cared for children, men and women with Ebola. Every day more than 100 new patients came in. It was so serious.  I wasn't afraid. I was determined to make the outbreak go away from my country. Every day I saw thousands of people from my country dying. Blood in their vomit, blood coming from their eyes, their ears, their mouth, their nose...  One day in November, I felt sick. I started to vomit, my body ached. I thought it was an ulcer like before. My mother said, "Let's go to the hospital." We called my boss and he said, "Bring her immediately." They isolated me, took blood samples, and treated me with IV fluids because I was vomiting seriously.  Within 24 hours, they came back. They were all wearing protective clothing and equipment. It was then that I knew. Tears streamed down my face. Immediately they took me into the red zone, the same place where I treat my patients. I was now like them.  In three days, I could not walk. I was blind, paralyzed, unable to talk or eat. I had a sore throat, body aches and my whole body itched. Blood started coming out of my eyes. I couldn't sleep. I was awake with pain all of the time. Once, my soul left my body. I saw my body lying down. I almost went insane. I thought, I am going to die, I will not make it. Every single day I cried. Ebola is a very dangerous disease.  During this time, my parents were quarantined. No one could visit me. All of my belongingsmy bed, my clothes, my shoeswere burned.  The first thing that happened when I started to feel better is that I was able to eat. I realized, "God still has plans for me." It took one month to relearn how to talk, to walk, to eat.  When I left the hospital in December, it was not easy. My mom, dad, brothers and sisters embraced me, but others turned their back on me. My friends were scared they would get Ebola. People pointed at me in the street. My parents and I had to leave our community and find a new place to live, far away, where people did not know.  I often say Ebola is a demonic disease, because of what it does to you when you are sick and what it does to you after. I have many friends who died from Ebola. In the hospital ward where I worked, all my medical colleagues who got Ebola died except me. One of my friends lost every member of her family.  Ebola is also demonic because of the stigmatization you face as a survivor. I always try to stay positive, even though it is hard for me, physically and emotionally. After surviving, I returned to work in the same hospital ward where I worked before, treating Ebola patients and giving them hope. I tell them I was a victim of Ebola, and I survived. When they refuse medication, I make an example of myself. I say, "I want you to do the same thing to be like me."  Just before returning to work, I met World Health Organization Director-General, Dr. Margaret Chan, when she visited our hospital. She hugged me and it felt so good. Her gesture showed everyone that they do not need to be scared. You should not reject survivors, you should embrace them. Then, Dr. Chan invited me to give the keynote address at the WHO's Ebola Special Session in Geneva.  I am twice a survivor. I lived through war in my country. During the war, my sister was shot and killed in front of me. I fainted and they set our home on fire. The heat from the fire woke me up and I survived. I faced stigmatization then, for two years in Guinea, where they told refugees like us to sit on the floor of the bus.  In many ways, Ebola is worse than war. With war, at least some of your family has a chance to survive. With Ebola, your entire family can be wiped out. Even if I have an enemy, I will never pray they become infected with Ebola. I will never think that.  I want to help Ebola survivors. I started a non-governmental organization, Pink Cross, to provide counseling for Ebola survivors facing stigmatization and to conduct public awareness campaigns. We are looking for a partner to help us build post-Ebola drop-in centers for Ebola survivors to come for counseling, support and training.  And I would like to further my education, so that I can pursue a career in my country helping people prevent and survive diseases like Ebola.  
 TEHRAN, Iran A well-known Iranian filmmaker has written an open letter calling for the release of journalist Roxana Saberi.  In a letter, Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi blames himself for urging Roxana Saberi to stay in Iran.  Bahman Ghobadi said he kept quiet about the arrest and conviction of the Iranian-American journalist at the request of her family. After Saberi was convicted last weekend and sentenced to an eight-year prison sentence, he said he felt he had to do something.  He told CNN that Saberi, whom he described as his fiancee, is caught in a "game of politics."  In his letter, which has been posted by the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, Ghobadi blames himself for urging Saberi to stay in Iran despite her desire to leave. Also, he writes, "My letter is a desperate call to all statesmen ... and to all those who can do something to help."  "From the other side of the ocean, the Americans have protested against her imprisonment, because she is an American citizen," he writes. "But I say no, she is Iranian, and she loves Iran. I beg you, let her go! I beg you not to throw her in the midst of your political games! She is too weak and too pure to take part in your games. Let me be present at her trial, sit next to her wise father and gentle mother, and testify she is without guilt or reproach."  The 40-year-old filmmaker said that Saberi was planning to leave the country, but he kept her from leaving until his latest filmwhich will be shown at this year's Cannes film festivalwas completed.  Ghobadi won the 2000 Golden Camera award at the Cannes festival for his feature film, "A Time for Drunken Horses."  Saberi, 31, was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one-day trial that was closed to the public. The decision prompted sharp denunciations from President Barack Obama, as well as other U.S. and international officials.  Iranian officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine. The Foreign Ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper accreditation. On April 9, word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage.  Saberi's lawyer has said he will appeal the verdict. Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi has ordered the head of Tehran's Justice Department to make sure the appeals process is quick and fair.  Ghobadi wrote that he is "optimistic about her release, and I firmly hope the verdict will be canceled in the next stage of the trial."  "My Iranian girl with Japanese eyes and an American ID, is in jail. Shame on me! Shame on us!"  CNN's Igor Krotov and Shirzad Bozorghmehr contributed to this report.

The South African Football Association (SAFA) have appealed to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) after the country failed to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations due to misinterpreting the tournament's rules.  South Africa celebrated on Saturday believing a 0-0 draw at home to Sierra Leone in Nelspruit had secured them top spot in qualification Group G due to their superior goal difference over their opponents and rivals Niger.  But it emerged Niger would advance to next year's tournament in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea as a result of their superior head-to-head record against South Africa and Sierra Leone, despite suffering a 3-0 defeat to bottom side Egypt in Cairo.  "We have noted that CAF has announced that Niger has qualified in our group," read a letter sent by SAFA to CAF. "Despite South Africa finishing on top of the group in terms of goal difference, which is the universally recognized means of separating teams who are equal on points.  Big names miss out on 2012 Africa Cup of Nations  "We believe that the team finishing top of the log at the end of the competition is automatically determined at the end of 90 minutes play, and that the second place is determined by the other rules.  "We will lay out our objection more fully shortly, but in the meantime wish to signal that we intend to challenge this interpretation and application of the rules."  SAFA president Kirsten Nematandani was defiant after the match, insisting the organization would challenge a lack of clarity in the tournament's rules.  "Do not despair, all is not lost," said Nematandani. "We believe we have a case and we will carry this fight all the way.  "If CAF's rules are ambiguous then we need to challenge that and we are well within our rights to do so. In the meantime be positive, and leave everything in our hands."  South Africa hosted football's biggest tournament last year when they became the first African country to stage a World Cup, but the team known as Bafana Bafana have now failed to reach two consecutive Cup of Nations.  It also proved to be a shocking qualifying campaign for Egypt, with the Pharaohs missing out on next year's event having won the last three tournaments in a row.  Egypt, the most successful team in the history of the Cup of Nations having won it seven times, recently appointed former U.S. coach Bob Bradley in an attempt to reverse their current fortunes.  Two-time winners Nigeria have also missed out on the 2012 competition after Guinea scored a late equalizer in a 2-2 draw on Saturday, to book their place in next year's tournament at the expense of the Super Eagles.  
 The mother of Kenneth Bae, the American imprisoned in North Korea, has arrived in the country to visit her ailing son, according to a friend of the family.  Earlier this year, Bae, a Korean-American, was sentenced to 15 years in a North Korean labor camp for what the government called "hostile acts."  His family has not been able to see him for almost a year since his November 3 arrest in North Korea.  "As a mother, I worry endlessly about his health," said his mother, Myunghee Bae in a videotaped statement. "I want to see him, comfort and hold him in person. I miss him so much."  Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, said that she pleaded with the North Korean authorities to let her visit her son, and expressed gratitude for granting permission. She is expected to be in North Korea for five days with the goal of encouraging her son who has become ill, according to a website dedicated to  Kenneth Bae's freedom.  In a prison interview released in July, Kenneth Bae had spoken of health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and a back problem. He looked noticeably thinner and wore a blue prison garment streaked with sweat and dirt.  His family say he has lost more than 50 pounds.  "My heart was broken into pieces when his prison interview was released on July 3," said his mother, in her statement. "His appearance was very shocking, he looked so different, and he lost so much weight. I could not believe that prisoner was my son."  Bae was moved to a hospital for serious health problems, his sister, Terri Chung had told CNN in August.  In previous interviews, Chung has said that her brother suffers from health problems including severe back and leg pain, kidney stones, dizziness, blurred vision and loss of vision. He was already dealing with diabetes.  His family and friends have asked North Korea for mercy and the United States for help in securing his release.  U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korea to release Bae. In August, the two countries appeared close, but North Korea rescinded an invitation to a U.S. envoy. Ambassador Robert King, President Barack Obama's special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, had been expected to fly to Pyongyang to try to win his freedom.  In previous instances, North Korea has released Americans in its custody after a visit by some U.S. dignitaryin recent cases, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.  Bae was arrested last year after arriving as a tourist in Rason City, a port in the northeastern corner of North Korea. His sister says that Bae is the owner of a tour company and was in North Korea for work.  The North Korean government accuses Bae of setting up bases in China for the purpose of "toppling" the North Korean government, encouraging North Korean citizens to bring down the government and conducting a "malignant smear campaign."  The country's state media also says that Bae had planned what it called a "Jericho operation" to bring down North Korea through religious activities. They have suggested that Bae could have been sentenced to death, but avoided it through "candid confession of his crimes."  On the eve of her trip, his mother looked solemnly into the camera, expressing her anxiety.  "It's hard to describe the agony of the past year since my son has been imprisoned in the DPRK," she said in a released statement. "I spend every day thinking about him and praying for his homecoming."

Hundreds of thousands of Catalans in northeastern Spain are due to increase pressure on Madrid for an independent, breakaway state Wednesday by forming a human chain for 400 kilometers (about 250 miles).  The human chain is organized by the grass-roots, citizen-led Catalan National Assembly, which last year on September 11Catalonia's national dayturned out an estimated 1.5 million people in Barcelona, the regional capital.  Catalan politicians followed up by demanding a referendum on self-determination by the end of 2014, which the Spanish government in Madrid staunchly opposes.  Spain's next threat: Losing 20% of its economy  While the political battle continues between Spain's two largest cities, Madrid and Barcelona, the human chain has emerged as the latest rallying point.  Organizers say 370,000 Catalans have signed up to take part, and they predict tens of thousands more will also participate. The chain will traverse Catalonia from the north, near the French border, to the south, on its border with the Spanish region of Valencia.  "It will be an innocent but powerful image to push the process ahead, holding hands," said Alfred Bosch, who represents Catalonia's pro-independence Republican Left party in Spanish Parliament in Madrid.  Dubbed the "Catalan Way Toward Independence," the human chain shows the process can only "go ahead, forward, and not back," Bosch said.  But the Spanish government doubts that. It says that Catalonia, with 7.5 million people, already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health.  Catalonia's fight for independence: Lessons from the Dutch  And Madrid insists that the Spanish Constitution does not allow any of Spain's 17 regions to unilaterally break away, even one like Catalonia that has its own flag and language.  On the eve of the human chain, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said political leaders should find a way to keep Catalonia within Spain.  But Catalan's president, Artur Mas, in an opinion article published Wednesday in The New York Times, wrote: "We ... seek no harm to Spain. We are bound together by geography, history and our people, as more than 40 percent of Catalonia's population came from other parts of Spain or has close family ties. We want to be Spain's brother, as equal partners."  Catalan parliament pushes self-determination  Catalonia says it's been the junior partner for too long. It produces 19% of Spain's wealth and says it sends far more in taxes to Madrid than it gets back in central government spending. It recalls a long history of slights, and at certain times outright repression, by Spain.  The human chain will start at 17:14 local time (11:14 a.m. ET), to honor Catalans who on September 11, 1714, lost a decisive battle to Spanish troops. The chain will last about an hour.  The current polemic is not just between Catalonia and Spain. Within Catalonia, there is also tension between leading political forces over the timing, and the potential wording, of the referendum.  President Mas, whose center-right Convergence and Union party governs only because of support from the Republican Left, seemed to leave the door open last week for a vote on self-determination later than 2014, perhaps in 2016. He has since repeated that he favors the 2014 deadline.  But the Republican Left and those organizing the human chain insist it must be by the end of 2014, with or without the consent of Madrid.  Various opinion polls show a very large majority of Catalans want the right of self-determination. But if independence makes it to the ballot, polls show the result could be tighter, some predicting a victory in the 50% range.  
 Hey, nature, thanks for reminding us that you are not to be played with.  Unless you are an adorable Australian quokka. We would play with them all day long.  From battling water creatures to lions opening car doors, animals have taken center stage on social media. And this is not your typical animal kingdom.  Check it out:  This bald eagle protecting her eggs in the snow in Pennsylvania has captured the Internet's heart. There is even a live stream.  According to Mashable, digital media producer Benjamin Savard was working on a video for the science department at Middlebury College in Vermont on Monday when he put a GoPro in a waterproof case inside an octopus tank.  The octopus grabbed it, took some selfies and then snapped a shot of Savard.  Which, of course, brings to mind the epic battle last month between an octopus and crab on an Australian beach.  This octopus at the Seattle Aquarium decided enough was enough last month and tried to escape its tank.  Land creatures are not to be outdone, however.  A video from 2014 gained attention this week, showing a lion opening the car door of a family driving through a safari park in South Africa.  As someone in the car says, "Oh, my gosh, I didn't know they could do that."  We are still giggling at the #WeaselPecker phenomenon: a photo of a weasel hitching a lift on the back of a flying woodpecker. The memes, people, the memes!  Finally, our beloved quokkas, a type of rodent, are the new stars of Instagram as folks in Australia clamor for selfies.

Former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley remained hospitalized early Sunday morning, two days after he fell ill.  Daley, 71, was taken by ambulance to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago on Friday evening after he returned from a business trip to Arizona, the hospital said.  Daley is in the hospital's intensive care unit for evaluationwith his family by his side, the hospital said.  A former state senator and county prosecutor, Daley was elected mayor in 1989, to complete the term of the late Harold Washington. He was re-elected over and over until he decided to not run for reelection in 2011.  In all, he served a record 22 years as Chicago's mayor. His father, Richard J. Daley, also served as the city's mayor.  President Barack Obama's former Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, succeeded the younger Daley.  Since leaving public office, Daley has kept busy, including speaking engagements and as special counsel at a law firm.  
 What would it be like to wear Google Glass? Google answered that very question Wednesday morning, posting a lot more information about Project Glass, including the user interface, through a series of photos and videos.  You can see the UI and some of the features of Glass here, although the images don't quite capture the exact experience. The headset doesn't actually have lenses in front of your eyes, just a small screen (viewable via a mirrored glass block) above and to the right of the wearer's right eye.  As such, the point-of-view images that show a large action window in the center of the field of view are a little misleading.  Still, the photos, posted on Google's Project Glass website, show more about how Glass works than any photo of the hardware could convey.  This video shows even more: Commanding the headset is as easy as uttering the words "OK, Glass," a clever use of real-world speech to engage the device's listening mode.  SEE ALSO: How Google Glass Could Change Advertising  Once engaged, Glass is capable of taking photos, recording videos, looking up answers on Google, showing reminders (such as for a flight) and sharing whatever you're looking at  either via messaging or through a Google+ Hangout.  As Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself revealed previously, Glass will also have an automatic picture-taking mode, snapping pics at a preset intervals (such as every 5 seconds).  Google also launched a contest with its own hashtag (#ifihadglass), challenging anyone to come up with creative uses for Google Glass that can be explained in 50 words or fewer. Winners will get the chance to buy their own, along with developers, when they become available. The price: $1,500, plus tax.  Are you impressed with how Google Glass works? Let us know in the comments.

LONDON, England They are some of the biggest names in Hollywood, but even Susan Sarandon, Ethan Hawke and Dustin Hoffman have had their fair share of casting calamities they would rather forget.  Mike Myers sabotaged some auditions for parts he didn't want. "Why not be nude even if it is a children's theatre?"  CNN's The Screening Room has managed to persuade the cream of Hollywood to confess their tales of audition woe.  The stars shudder at the memory of waiting in line, frantically trying to memorize lines handed to them moments before, all the while being assessed by critical strangers.  Benicio del Toro recounts attending 50 or 60 auditions before getting a part and Quentin Tarantino told Eli Roth he "blew it" when he first auditioned for "Inglourious Basterds." While Catherine Keener remembers a cutting personal assessment: "You're not pretty enough."  Here are some of their worst moments:  Bill Nighy "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest." "Love Actually"  "There was one that started out terrible, which was where I had to go to a disused tax office in Harrow [near London, England] very early in the morning and put on very tight velvet flared loon pants and a pair of crocodile four-inch- heeled platform shoes, and wear a sort of very small top that didn't meet my trousers, hair extensions and I had to karaoke to 'Smoke on the Water' by Deep Purple. It's a very lonely place. And I was 45 at the time..."  Ethan Hawke "Before Sunset," "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"  "I have had so many bad auditions. I have fallen on my ass. I have made a complete fool of myself. I auditioned for Robert Redford once and I was so starstruck I couldn't even speak. I had a mic wire at a screen test clipped to me and then I got kind of nervous and I paced in a circle and then took a step and tripped and fell on my face. You just have to forgive yourself and keep going on."  Mike Myers "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," "Shrek"  "I've had some bad auditions for some TV movies that were shooting in England where I just didn't want to be in them and offered them more obtuse [performances] ... I like to think of it as performance art. I didn't sabotage it, I was just woefully inappropriate, you know? I just thought, 'Why not be nude even if it is a children's theatre?"  Catherine Keener "Being John Malkovich," "Synecdoche, New York"  "You wouldn't believe some of the comments, assessments. But, they're really not meant personally. Like for example, 'You're not pretty enough.' For them it's just a fact. But for you it's like, 'Oh my God! I have to live with this.' You get a thicker skin about it, which you should because it isn't meant personally, but it's such a personal profession that you kind of have to get used to getting critiqued on things that you shouldn't even care about."  Dustin Hoffman "Marathon Man," "Meet the Fockers"  "The most famous casting director from New York, I was lucky enough to get an audition with her in the '60s. She did all the plays, all the Broadway plays. She is sitting across the desk saying her lines, and I am saying mine, and she stops and says, 'Come here. Bring your chair here, right next to me.' And I say, 'Why?' And she says, 'Because I can't hear you, and you have never been on the stage or on Broadway, and you are going to have to reach the last row.'  I said, 'Yeah, I know. I have been studying acting for about seven years now, but I'm not on Broadway now, I'm just sitting in front of you.' So, she said, 'I know, but I couldn't hear you. That's why I asked you to sit next to me.' I said, 'Okay. Can you hear me now?' I was getting so angry. Well, at that point she said, 'Speak up,' and I screamed as loud as I could, every line after.

Eli Roth "Death Proof," "Inglourious Basterds"  "I left the casting of 'Hostel: Part II,' which Quentin [Tarantino] was a producer on to go and audition for his movie ['Inglourious Basterds'] and it was just a room with a camera. He wasn't even there and I was like, 'Where's Quentin?' They go 'He didn't leave his house today.' Anyways, I blew it. I did terribly and Quentin called me and starts making fun of me. He was like,'You were so bad in your audition, but I'll give you a callback. Come on.'  Demi Moore "A Few Good Men," "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"  "I auditioned for 'A Few Good Men' with Tom Cruise and Rob Reiner and when I went into that audition I was eight months pregnant ,so there is always kind of a lasting impression that I was playing this military officer with this gigantic belly. Obviously, it turned out well because I got the role but there was something quite odd about it."  Roger Moore "Octopussy," "Curse of the Pink Panther"  "I remember auditioning for one play, and the girl was awfully short and we were holding the book in our hands and I almost couldn't see her. I knew I wasn't going to get that part, I tried to make myself smaller and smaller so I could be closer her size and that didn't happen."  Ramon Rodriguez  "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"  "I met ['Transformers' director] Michael Bay in his office in Santa Monica for an hour and a half he had me running, jumping and diving all over his office and his furniture freaking out like I was reacting to robots, which is the strangest audition I have had by far. I left the room completely drenched in sweat and all I could say was, 'I better get this part.' It worked out and the stuff we did in the room was the stuff we did on set."  
 It started with a baby.  Within minutes, dozens of teenagers and children staggered into an emergency room on the outskirts of Aleppo, Syria.  Rola Hallam, a British Syrian doctor, describes what she saw there in late August while working with the charity Hand in Hand for Syria.  "We had had, you know, over 30 who had arrived, all within about 10 or 15 minutes, all with just heartbreaking, extensive burns," she said.  The patients were victims of an August 26 attack in Awram al-Koubra, outside Aleppo, where eyewitnesses described incendiary like devices being dropped from a government fighter jet onto a private residence, and then a school.  Incendiary bombs are not chemical weapons, but their effects can be just as devastating.  Syria: Chemical weapons team faces many dangers, says U.N. chief Ban  They are identified as "any weapon or munition which is primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to persons through the action of flame, heat, or combination thereof, produced by a chemical reaction of a substance delivered on the target," according to the United Nations.  British emergency doctor Saleyha Ahsan describes them in less clinical terms, in the terms of her patients.  "The descriptions were fire falling like rain, just falling like rain, plumes of flames and then balls of flames falling out of the sky," she said.  "Their clothes had just been stripped off them from the power of heat and the incendiary device, covered in burns and some of them very shocked and quiet, and not sure where they were and what was going on."  Read more: Refugees inside their own war-torn country  The day of the attack, she, Hallam and others treated about 40 victims, some of whom suffered burns over 80% of their bodies.  By chance, the doctors were filming with the BBC's Panorama program to highlight medical conditions in Syria. The cameras kept rolling as patients poured in.  'I wanted their faces seen'  The video is disturbing to watch. It shows people sitting on the floor, their skin peeled and hanging like ripped clothes.  'I felt like I was in a horror show or something on a movie set. It was so surreal," said Hallam.  "All walking in, with a really bewildered look on their face, an absolutely awful smell of burning flesh mixed with a very weird synthetic smell that I've never smelled before."  WMD: From A-bombs to pressure cookers  Eights students died in the attack and 50 other people suffered burns, according to the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry, which investigates alleged violations of human rights law in Syria. It will issue a report next month.  The United Nations says more than 100,000 people, including civilians, have been killed since the start of the country's two-year-old civil war. Conventional, not chemical weapons, are believed to be responsible for the vast majority of those deaths.  Both Hallam and Ahsan said they would expect very few of their patients to survive for any amount of time.  "I wanted their faces seen," Hallam said.  "I wanted the whole world to know that what is happening in Syria is happening, and I don't want anyone to say I never knew because you all know. And the world needs to act."

A 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck early Sunday off Indonesia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  The quake rattled a remote swath of sea between the Pacific and Indian oceans, north of Australia and east of Timor-Leste, some 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) deep, according to the U.S. agency.  It was centered approximately 212 miles (340 kilometers) west-northwest of Saumlaki in Indonesia's Tanimbar Islands, 217 miles east-northeast of Dili, Timor-Leste, and 226 miles of Ambon, Indonesia.  Neither the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center nor the Japan Meteorological Agency issued tsunami warnings or advisories immediately after the tremor.  
 Capt. Chesley Sullenberger, the hero pilot who safely landed a full passenger jet in the Hudson River, was once again honored with cheers and applause Tuesday during a ceremony for him hosted by the governor of his home state.  Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger a flag and license plate.  California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, first lady Maria Shriver and other dignitaries greeted Sullenberger at the state Capitol rotunda in Sacramento.  Taking a break from difficult negotiations over a troubled state budget, the governor presented Sullenberger with a jacket with the state seal, a California state flag that had flown over the state Capitol, a proclamation and a "California Hero" license plate.  "Today is a very important day," Schwarzenegger said. "There are legislators upstairs that are negotiating and working on a budget[we] need a great hero in a state capitol."  The Sullenberger family lives in Danville, California.  Sullenberger's response was understatedas it has been at other ceremonies, including a New York City Hall event when he was given the key to the city by Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  "On behalf of the other four crew members of Flight 1549 and also on behalf of the many thousands of aviation professionals whose daily devotion to duty keeps air travel safe, I gratefully accept this recognition," he said.  Sullenberger and his crew safely landed the damaged airplane, believed to have hit a flock of birds, in the Hudson on January 15. All 155 passengers aboard the US Airways flight survived.

Police in Boise, Idaho, said late Monday that they have made an arrest in connection with a break-in at a local zoo and the death of a patas monkey there.  Michael J. Watkins, 22, faces two felony charges, burglary and grand theft.  "I speak for many of us in the police department and the community who were angered and outraged over this senseless crime," said Boise Police Chief Michael Masterson. "As usual, it was a combination of a citizen tip and good police work that led us to the arrest in this case."  Police were called to Zoo Boise early Saturday morning by a guard who reported a burglary in progress. The security guard saw two men, one inside the zoo and one outside. They ran.  During an unsuccessful search for the man inside the zoo, police and zoo employees found a patas monkey that was seriously injured near an exhibit where the suspect was last seen. The animal died; the cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head and neck.  Following citizen tips and information gleaned from the investigation, police arrested Watkins in Washington County, Idaho, where he remains in custody.  He has injuries on his upper torso, but police have not yet been able to determine the cause of those injuries, Masterson said.  The police chief declined to speculate on the suspect's motives. He said he does not expect the other man the guard saw at the zoo to be criminally charged.  Zoo Boise still has one patas monkey that the staff is giving extra attention in the wake of the other's death.  "For the short time, he is OK being by himself, but that's not a long-term solution. Monkeys need to be housed in social groups, and so ... we are actively trying to find another patas monkey that we might be able to bring the zoo," said Steve Burns, the zoo's director.  He said members of his staff were confused and angry when he first told them what happened.  "They kept asking why and I didn't have an answer for them," he said.

 Hezbollah denounced the European Union's decision to list its military wing as a terrorist organization, calling the move "aggressive and imbalanced."  The Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group is already viewed as a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel. In recent months, it has joined forces with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's ongoing civil war.  Hezbollah issued a statement Tuesday saying the EU's decision Monday was "written by American hands using Israeli ink" and that "all (that) was left for the Europeans to do was to sign the document and approve the legislation."  Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said he hoped that the European Union had read data and facts about Hezbollah more thoroughly before making the decision, the state-run National News Agency reported. The report did not specify what data about Hezbollah the prime minister was referring to.  Hezbollah leader acknowledges fighters' presence in Syria town  The EU move  The European Union agreed to target just the military component, a European diplomat told CNN. Critics of such an approach say designating part of an entity isn't effective or practical.  But Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni's spokeswoman called the decision "correct and just," adding that it "puts an end to the wrong argument" that Hezbollah's military activities are absolved by the group's political status.  "Even if Hezbollah is a political party, that does not whitewash and make legitimate their terrorist activities," the spokeswoman said.  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the move "will have a significant impact on Hezbollah's ability to operate freely in Europe by enabling European law enforcement agencies to crack down on Hezbollah's fundraising, logistical activity and terrorist plotting."  "As Hezbollah has deepened its support for the brutal Assad regime and worked to expand its global reach through increased involvement in international criminal schemes and terrorist plots around the world, a growing number of governments are recognizing Hezbollah as the dangerous and destabilizing terrorist organization that it is," Kerry said.  The Syrian National Coalition, an affiliation of Syrian dissident groups, praised the EU's movebut said the group could do more.  "We urge the European Union to extend their decision to include all of Hezbollah political officials who are part of the decision making" of the party's military wing, the SNC said in a statement Tuesday.  The SNC also called for "the trial of all of Hezbollah's officials for their crimes of terrorism committed against our Syrian people and on our soil."  Donilon: Hezbollah not a 'responsible political actor'  Hezbollah was formed after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to go after the Palestine Liberation Organization. The group has been accused of high-profile terror attacks over the years.  Opinion: Time for G8 to make Hezbollah statement  "Hezbollah first gained notoriety in 1983 after it bombed the United States Embassy in Beirutan attack that killed 63 people," wrote Tom Donilon, President Barack Obama's former national security adviser, in a New York Times column this year.  "Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah bombed the American and French Marine Barracks in Beirut, killing 241 Americans and 58 French service members with one of the largest explosive devices ever detonated during a terrorist attack."  The group also conducted a series of kidnappings, airplane hijackings and bombings in the 1980s and 1990s, Donilon wrote.  He said the group has tried to portray itself as a political entity focused on social services and defending the country.  "But it is an illusion to speak of Hezbollah as a responsible political actor," Donilon said. "Hezbollah remains a terrorist organization and a destabilizing force across the Middle East."  CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.

BAGHDAD, Iraq  U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates flew into Iraq on Monday to oversee a change of command of American forces.  Robert Gates is greeted Monday at Baghdad International Airport by Army Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin.  Gen. Ray Odierno will take over command Tuesday from Gen. David Petraeus, whose 20-month term in Iraq saw a significant decline in violence with the deployment of additional U.S. troops.  U.S. forces are in "mission transition," Gates said Monday, with some troops going home and others backing up Iraqis.  "There is no question we will still be engaged, but the areas in which we are seriously engaged will continue to narrow," Gates said during his flight to Iraq.  "The challenge for Odierno is how do we work with the Iraqis to preserve the gains we've already achieved and expand on them even as the number of U.S. forces are shrinking."  Odierno is expected to set the stage for an eventual U.S. withdrawal.  Petraeus will become the new chief of U.S. Central Command, in charge of American forces in the Middle East and Afghanistan.  Gates, who is making his eighth trip to Iraq, said Petraeus played a "historic role" during his tenure.  "I think he would be the first to acknowledge that he has had a brilliant strategy," he said. "But it has been the brigade commanders and company commanders and the soldiers and Marines and others on the ground who have actually made it work.  "We have lost a lot of lives, but it's really been an extraordinary effort of translations of a great strategy into a great success in a very difficult circumstance."  At a dinner on the eve of the change-of-command ceremony, Gates presented Petraeus with the Defense Superior Service Medal. He also gave Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, the Distinguished Civilian Service Awardthe highest award given by the secretary of Defense to those not in uniform.  "I have never seen a working relationship like this," Gates told the two men. "To find leaders to do what many considered impossible, you two are such men."  Odierno will receive his fourth star on Tuesday in a separate ceremony ahead of the change-of-command ceremony.  The defense secretary on Monday also met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and told the Iraqi leader that he has seen a notable improvement in security since his first visit to the country nearly two years ago, according to a statement released by the prime minister's office.  Gates said the cooperation between Iraqi security forces and coalition forces was responsible for the improvement in security, according to the statement, and al-Maliki praised the successes of the Iraqi armed forces.  The prime minister said the gains have brought about a greater sense of normalcy in the country, allowing many internally displaced Iraqis to return to their homes. They also have spurred the economy, he said.  The situation in Iraq is far different from that in past years, the prime minister noted.  As Gates arrived in Iraq, three bombingstwo in Baghdad and one in Diyala province's Balad Ruzprovided a rude counterpoint to that message.  Two car bombs went off in central Baghdad. The blasts killed 12 people and wounded 36 in the commercial area of the Karrada district, an Interior Ministry official said. The U.S. blamed al Qaeda in Iraq, but gave a lower death toll, saying two "possible" car bombs killed six people and wounded 27.  In Balad Ruz, a female suicide bomber detonated explosives at the house of a former U.S. detainee, killing at least 22 people and wounding 33, according to a Diyala security official.  The U.S. military also blamed al Qaeda in Iraq for a car bombing Friday in Dujail, north of Baghdad. The Interior Ministry said at least 30 people were killed and 45 wounded; the U.S. said 31 were killed and 40 were wounded.  CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.  
 When President Barack Obama said that U.S. strategy to combat the terror group ISIS could follow the models of strikes in Yemen and Somalia, it drew a swift rebuttal from some top Republicans.  Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona took to the Senate floor Thursday to say the administration's tactics in both of those countries had not succeeded and would be even less effective when used against ISIS.  "That is so disturbing, to think that a strategy against ISIS would be the same as against al Qaeda in Somalia and Yemen," said McCain. "Yes, we have been killing with drones. But we have by no means defeated them," he said.  He was responding to Obama's speech Wednesday night: "This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years."  Another Republican, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, told CNN Thursday that not only had the administration's strategy in Yemen and Somalia come up short, but also that it was not the right template to apply to Syria.  "ISIL poses a risk very different from the risk posed by terrorists in those two countries," Rubio told CNN, using an alternate acronym for the militant group. "ISIL is a terrorist group, but it has insurgent elements to it. They are working with people on the ground. They control territory. They've got funding, and they carry out military-style operations. They pose a much different risk."  CIA: ISIS can 'muster' between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters  But the White House defended the comparison, saying that there have been some successes against both groups, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen and  Al-Shabaab in Somalia.  "There is still more work to do in those countries. But what has been put in place is a counterterrorism strategy that has succeeded in degrading the threat, and making those organizations less capable of threatening the American people," said spokesman Josh Earnest.  "In both of those situations, the President has selectively and strategically brought American military might to bear in support of those ground troops to mitigate and counter the threat."  Over the past few years, the amount of territory that extremists control in Yemen and Somalia has indeed been rolled back. And several terrorist leaders in both countries have been killed by American strikes, including Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Godane, and AQAP's No. 2, Said Ali al-Shihri, and top propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki.  A frightening, far-reaching new world of terror threats since 9/11  But Thomas Joscelyn at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies maintains the fight against AQAP has been no success story.  "AQAP is still planning attacks against the U.S. homeland," Joscelyn said.  And the group's top leadership is still mainly intact, he said.  "Naser al-Wahishi, who was groomed by Osama bin Laden to run an al Qaeda branch, has in fact been the emir with that organization for years now. He is still in place," he said. "Many of his top lieutenants are still in place, including the chief theologians and the chief military officers."  Boehner hits Obama for ruling out boots on the ground  Also still at large is AQAP's master bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri. He is believed to be behind the nearly successful printer-cartridge bombs placed on American-bound planes in 2010, and the underwear bomb on a plane to Detroit in 2009.  "There's concern now he may be sharing his bomb-making technology with jihadist groups in Syria," said terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank.  Carrying out air strikes against ISIS could be even more difficult than against AQAP and Al-Shabaab, because while the governments of Somalia and Yemen have complemented American airstrikes by deploying ground forces against extremists, the U.S. has no such partner in Syria's government. And according to Cruickshank, ISIS fighters are more inextricably mixed in with civilian populations in Iraq and Syria.  But he added that military action against extremists can be successful, even if it does not produce total victory.  "The more you can shrink the space they can operate, the more you can take out training camps so they can't provide bomb-making instructions to Western recruits, you're clearly then limiting their ability to plot terrorist attacks against the West."  Still, he warned, "It's going to be a long time before that capability to theoretically plot attacks against the West is going to be wiped out."  Kerry: U.S. not at war with ISIS

Venice, Italy George Clooney, the man long considered one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors, followed up his private wedding to British human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin with a civil ceremony in Venice, Italy, on Monday.  Clooney, 53, and Alamuddin, 36, arrived at Venice's city hallthe Ca' Farsetti palazzoin a water taxi appropriately named "Amore," or "Love."  Venetian authorities stopped pedestrian and boat traffic in the area for the ceremony.  Clooney wore a gray suit and dark tie, while Alamuddin was dressed in flowing cream trousers, a cream top with a blue border and a wide-brimmed matching hat.  The couple spent about 10 minutes inside the venue before boating to their hotel, with well-wishers lining the canal.  Rai, Italian state television, later reported that they had left Venice on a private jet, heading for Londonleaving "Amore" free for other visitors to the city.  Private ceremony  Celebrities, paparazzi and the world's media congregated in Venice for Clooney and Alamuddin's widely anticipated nuptials.  Their private ceremony on Saturday was marked with a star-studded bash at the Aman Canal Grande Venice resort, housed in the 16th-century Palazzo Papadopoli.  Clooney also arrived by motorboat to that ceremony, waving to the sound of "George, auguri!" as Venetians offered their best wishes.  Plenty of paparazzi, cameramen and photographers were on the docks facing the Aman Canal Grande. Others were going up and down the Grand Canal on taxi boats.  The first celebrity guests to arrive were also caught on camera in the city famed for romance, notably actor Matt Damon, American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and supermodel Cindy Crawford.  "I guess this is, as Dean Martin put it, 'That's Amore,' the land of love," said a tourist visiting Venice from Canada, referring to the late crooner's signature song.  "Yes, my heart is broken but I'm excited," his partner said with a smile.  The actor and his then-fiancee were also photographed Friday cruising the sun-dappled canals of Venice ahead of their big day.  Why Venice?  Clooney revealed earlier this month at a celebrity charity event in Tuscany, Italy, that he and Alamuddin would be tying the knot in Venice.  According to People magazine, Clooney was receiving a humanitarian award at the black-tie gala, and said during his acceptance speech, "I met my lovely bride-to-be here in Italy, whom I will be marrying, in a couple of weeks, in Venice, of all places."  Since they became engaged in the spring, Clooney and Alamuddin have been largely protective of their relationship.  When a Daily Mail report claimed that Clooney and his Lebanese future mother-in-law, Baria Alamuddin, were at odds, Clooney blasted the publication with a first-person piece in USA Today, and then refused to accept the Daily Mail's subsequent apology.  Laura Smith-Spark reported from London and Erin McLaughlin and Livia Borghese reported from Venice for this article.  
 Pope Francis donned a slicker to conduct an outdoor Mass for hundreds of thousands who gathered Saturday morning in the Philippines despite stormy weather.  The Mass in Tacloban was shortened because of an approaching typhoon that had sustained winds of 80 mph and higher gusts.  A throng gathered at the Tacloban airport to greet the Pope when he arrived at about 9 a.m. local time (8 p.m. ET.)  The Mass began nearby about half an hour after he landed. Wind rustled the hood on the pontiff's slicker as he spoke to a crowd clad in raincoats.  Tacloban is still recovering from the 2013 disaster of Super Typhoon Haiyan, described as perhaps the strongest storm ever recorded with 195 mph sustained winds that killed 6,300 people nationwide.  Typhoon Mekkhala was upgraded from a tropical storm and should make landfall in the Philippines at about noon, about an hour after the Mass concluded, just northeast of Tacloban, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris.  The forecast track has shifted slightly northward with the center of the storm expected to pass north of Tacloban.  Another typhoon was headed for the same general area in the Philippines early Saturday, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said.  Typhoon Mekkhala, which is called Typhoon Amang in the Philippines, was arriving on the island of eastern Samara site about 50 miles from where the Pope was in Tacloban.  Just two weeks ago, a tropical storm struck Tacloban and surrounding area, causing a commercial passenger plane to slide off the runway while landing at the Tacloban airport, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Tropical Storm Jiangmi, renamed Seniang in the Philippines, killed 54 people in landslides and flash floods in that region, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported.  During the Pope's visit to Tacloban, he will have lunch with survivors of the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan, renamed Typhoon Yolanda in that country. That typhoon displaced 918,000 families nationwide, the government says.  Francis is also to bless the Pope Francis Centre for the Poor and will meet with clergy and more typhoon survivors in the cathedral in Palo.  The Pope is expected to fly out of Tacloban at 5 p.m. Saturday (4 a.m. Saturday ET).  "At that point, they're still in the teeth of the storm. So not only is getting in a challenge, but also getting out," Miller said.  The Pontiff is also scheduled to perform an outdoor Mass in Manila on Sunday before millions of Filipinos, Miller said.  By then, the storm should weaken to a tropical depression, and its center should be about 109 miles south of the Pope, Miller said. Still, the storm is capable of delivering its heaviest rainfall at that distance, and Manila could face gusty winds and significant rain during the Mass, Miller added.  The Pope's trip to Asian isles began Tuesday in Sri Lanka, and he landed in the Philippines on Friday.  On Friday, Francis met with President Benigno Aquino, and the Pontiff urged the political leader to reject corruption and promote "honesty, integrity and commitment to the common good," the Vatican said. He also spoke of "the moral imperative of ensuring social justice and respect for human dignity," according to a copy of his remarks provided by the Vatican.  "Here in the Philippines, countless families are still suffering from the effects of natural disasters. The economic situation has caused families to be separated by migration and the search for employment, and financial problems strain many households. While all too many people live in dire poverty, others are caught up in materialism and lifestyles which are destructive of family life and the most basic demands of Christian morality," the Pope said in other remarks.  The Pope will end his tour Monday, when he will leave Manila for Rome.

This weekend, Saudi women will once again defy their nation's long-standing driving ban and get behind the wheel, facing harassment, intimidation and arrest.  On Saturday, the "Women2Drive" campaign will renew Saudi women's demand to exercise their right to drive. In many parts of Saudi Arabia, women are already driving and publishing online videos of themselves in the act. Interestingly, footage has also surfaced of Saudi men driving by and giving the thumbs-up sign to show their support.  An informal Saudi ban on driving became official policy in November 1990 during the Gulf War. As female American soldiers based in Saudi Arabia drove freely through military bases, 47 Saudi women organized a convoy to drive the streets of Riyadh in protest against the law that restricted them. Officials arrested them and suspended many from their jobs.  The Grand Mufti, the country's most senior religious authority, declared a fatwa, or religious edict, against women driving because driving would expose women "to temptation" and lead to "social chaos." Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz, then minister of interior, issued a decree on the basis of the fatwa banning driving for women.  The Grand Mufti who issued the fatwa died in 1999, as Prince Nayef did in 2012, but the ban has remained. When King Abdullah came to power in 2005, he said he believed that, "the day will come when women drive." That day might have arrived.  Saudi Arabia issues warning to women drivers, protesters  Saudi women launched the online "Women2Drive" campaign in 2011, perhaps inspired by women in Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Libya who stood shoulder to shoulder with men during uprisings to overthrow dictators and fight for freedom. They declared that starting on June 17, 2011, women with international drivers' licenses should take to the roads.  Scores drove, and many were stopped by traffic police. Their male guardians were forced to sign pledges that they would not allow the women to drive again. One woman was sentenced to 10 lashes; later an appeals court overturned her sentence.  Recently, Saudi Arabia has made several small advances in women's rights. Women can stand as candidates and vote in municipal elections, next due in 2015. They can work in various sectors without approval from their male guardians. The king has appointed 30 women to the Shura Council, his 150-member senior advisory body. Saudi Arabia has also recently passed a law criminalizing domestic violence.  Despite these advances, Saudi women continue to face profound discrimination. The guardianship system still treats them as legal minors who cannot conduct official government business, travel abroad, marry, pursue higher education or undergo certain medical procedures without permission from their male guardiansa husband, father, brother or even a young son.  Two leading women's rights activists, Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Oyouni, who have also fought the driving ban, face imprisonment for trying to help a woman who said that her husband had locked her and her children in their home without food or water.  Saudi blogger detained, but hopeful about campaign allowing women to drive  The ban on driving may not be the most limiting form of discrimination for some Saudi women, yet it has become symbolic of a much deeper oppression that touches all aspects of women's lives in the kingdom: It has become for Saudi women what a bus seat was to Rosa Parks and other African-Americans in the 1950s.  To explain why women cannot drive, Saudi authorities often use the excuse that "society is not ready."  Yet on occasion, King Abdullah has chosen to ignore such arguments and sidestep the religious establishment. He opened the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology in 2009 as the first mixed-gender university in the kingdom. Then he fired a cleric on the Council of Senior Scholars, the highest state body for the interpretation of Islamic law, when the man spoke out against the mixing of men and women at the university.  Recently, a cleric presented a new excuse to prohibit driving for women: he asserted that "driving affects women's ovaries." While this absurd contention is unsubstantiated by any medical or scientific evidence, it may be significant in Saudi discourse because it seems to separate the prohibition on driving from Islamic law, or Sharia, claiming women shouldn't drive because of health risks, rather than any religious prohibition.  Even the head of the religious police stated in September that Sharia has no text forbidding women from driving.  In short, the Saudi government, having ratified the U.N. Convention on All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, is obliged to treat women equally and not enforce a discriminatory policy.  As Saudi women take to the roads again, the world should join them in demanding an end to this denial of basic rights.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rothna Begum.  
 WASHINGTON U.S. intelligence agencies believe Osama bin Laden is isolated from al Qaeda and spending much of his energy merely surviving, the head of the CIA said on Thursday.  Osama bin Laden remains on the run despite a $25 million reward for his capture.  CIA Director Michael Hayden said hunting down bin Laden remains his agency's priority.  "He is putting a lot of energy into his own survivala lot of energy into his own security," Hayden said in a speech at the Atlantic Council in Washington.  "In fact, he appears to be largely isolated from the day-to-day operations of the organization he nominally heads," he said.  In recent weeks, there have been several U.S. missile strikes by unmanned drones around the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.  The United States maintains that Taliban and al Qaeda forces operate with relative impunity in tribal areas along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan and use those areas as staging grounds to attack U.S. forces and their allies inside Afghanistan.  Hayden said al Qaeda has been hurt by a sustained fight with the United States and its allies, but remains a threat.  "Al Qaeda has suffered serious setbacks, but it remains a determined, adaptive enemy unlike any our nation has ever faced," Hayden said. "The war is far from over."  Regardless of whether bin Laden is actively helping lead the terrorist organization, the CIA believes capturing or killing him would be a huge blow to al Qaeda, according to Hayden.  "This is an organization that has never been through a change at the top," he said. "For 20 years, bin Laden has been the visionary, the inspiration or harmonizing force behind al Qaeda."  Hayden said it remained to be seen whether bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, could maintain unity in the ranks without him.  "The truth is, we simply don't know what would happen if bin Laden is killed or captured. But I'm willing to bet that whatever happens, it would work in our favor," Hayden said.

The office of House Speaker John Boehner slammed comments by an architect of Obamacare who said the health care law was sold to the American public with misleading messaging, arguing Jonathan Gruber's remarks confirm the ill-will behind passage of the law.  "If there was ever any doubt that ObamaCare was rammed through Congress with a heavy dose of arrogance, duplicity, and contempt for the will of the American people, recent comments made by ... Jonathan Gruber, put that to rest," Boehner's office said said in a statement Thursday.  Videos recently emerged showing Gruber suggesting that the administration exploited the "the stupidity of the American voter" and the "lack of economic understanding of the American voter" in pushing the Affordable Care Act.  Third video emerges of Obamacare architect insulting voters  In the statement, Boehner's office said, "the American people are anything but 'stupid.' They're the ones bearing the consequences of the president's health care law and, unsurprisingly, they continue to oppose it."  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest pushed back against Gruber's comments in a press briefing in Myanmar, saying, "I disagree vigorously with" the assessment that the White House passed the law by taking advantage of what they saw as the voters' lack of intelligence.  "This was a very difficult undertaking but ultimately this is a law that has had significant benefits for millions of people," he said, adding that Republicans are the ones "who have been less than forthright and transparent about what their proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act would do in terms of the choices are available to middle class families."  For his part, Gruber said Tuesday on MSNBC that he "was speaking off the cuff" and "spoke inappropriately."  "And I regret making those comments," he added.  Boehner's next challenge  CNN's Jake Tapper and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.  
 A 12.76-carat pink diamond has been unearthed in an Australian mine, the largest ever found in the country.  Christened as the Argyle Pink Jubilee, the diamond was found in mining giant Rio Tinto's Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia's East Kimberly region. The Argyle mine is the world's largest producer of pink diamonds, with Rio Tinto reporting that the mine generates more than 90% of the global market supply.  "A diamond of this caliber is unprecedentedit has taken 26 years of Argyle production to unearth this stone, and we may never see one like this again," said Argyle Pink Diamonds Manager Josephine Johnson in a statement.  Rio Tinto expects that after two months of assessment and planning, it will take ten days to cut and polish the diamond into a single stone. The finished stone will be offered for sale during the company's annual Argyle Pink Diamonds Tender later this year.  According to Australia's Herald Sun, the diamond will be worth at least US$1.07 million.  However, it is premature to judge the stone's significance at this point, according to Sotheby's Asia department head of jewelry, Chin Yeow Quek.  "It is hard to judge a stone in the rough. It really depends on how large the rock will be polished downed to," he said, explaining that diamonds tend to lose at least 50% of their weight during the polishing process. "It also depends on the [intensity of] color and clarity," he added.  He cited as a benchmark the 24.78-carat fancy intense pink diamond sold by Sotheby's Geneva office in November, 2010 for more than US $46 million, which set the world's auction record for any diamond and jewel at US$1.86 million per carat.  Natural pink diamonds are considered one of the most valuable types of diamonds, and are typically found in museums, fine auction houses, and on the hands of royalty. The company said the Argyle Pink Jubilee is in a similar light pink color to the 24-carat Williamson Pink that Britain's Queen Elizabeth II received as a wedding gift.

The biology professor charged in the shooting deaths Friday of three faculty members at the University of Alabama in Huntsville fatally shot her brother more than 23 years ago, police said Saturday.  Amy Bishop Anderson, who was then known as Amy Bishop, was never charged in her brother's death, Braintree, Massachusetts, Police Chief Paul Frazier told reporters. Police records detailing the 1986 incident are missing, and a log of the incident lists it as an accidental shooting, he said.  But the account told by Frazier differs from the one published at the time by a Boston newspaper.  "It is a far different story I believe than what was reported back then," Frazier said. "I cannot tell you what the thought process was behind our releasing her at the time."  A December 8, 1986, article in the Boston Globe states that Anderson asked her mother how to unload a round from a 12-gauge shotgun and accidentally shot her brother while she was handling the weapon. The article cited then-Police Chief John Polio as the source.  However, Frazier said an officer, who was involved in the case and still works for the department, told him that Anderson shot her brother in the chest during an argument. The woman allegedly fired a shot in her bedroom without hitting anyone, then argued with her brother and shot him. She fired yet another round in the home before fleeing, Frazier said.  Police arrested Anderson after she pointed a weapon at a vehicle near the house in an attempt to get the driver to stop, but it drove on, Frazier said.  But during the booking process, Chief Polio called and told the officers to release her, Frazier said.  In a telephone call with CNN, Polionow 87 and retireddenied ever calling in the order. He said detectives had interviewed Anderson and her motherJudith Baker, who was a member of the police department's personnel boardas well as the lead investigator, Capt. Theodore Buker, who has since died.  Buker told him that the shooting appeared accidental and the two men agreed she should be released to her mother, Polio said. A request was then filed with the office of District Attorney Bill Delahunt to conduct an inquiry, but Delahunt never did so, he said.  Delahunt, now a Democratic congressman representing Massachusetts, was in Jerusalem on Saturday and unable to comment on the case, spokesman Mark Forest told CNN.  Polio acknowledged that an argument had occurred during the shooting and said that the other shots, including one fired into the ceiling, did not appear aimed at anyone. He also recalled that Anderson had fled the scene. But, he said, he could not remember what he had told the newspaper in reference to the case or why details, including the argument, were not reported.  Polio rejected as "laughable" any suggestions that the suspect's mother might have influenced their handling of the case.  "There was no cover up," Polio said. "Absolutely no cover up and no missing records. The records were all there when I left. Where they went in the last 22 years and two police chiefs subsequent, I don't know."  Anderson, a Harvard-educated professor, has been charged with capital murder.  Huntsville Police Chief Henry Reyes said Anderson, 45, was attending a faculty meeting on the third floor of the sciences building Friday afternoon when she shot six colleagues, killing three.  Anderson, a professor and researcher at the university, was arrested as she was leaving the building, Reyes told reporters Saturday. He said a 9 mm handgun was recovered from the second floor of the building late Friday.  Anderson is charged with one count of capital murder, a crime that involved two or more intentional deaths and is eligible for the death penalty in Alabama. Madison County District Attorney Rob Broussard said officials were considering other charges, including attempted murder.  University spokesman Ray Garner has identified the dead as Gopi Podila, chairman of the biological sciences department; Maria Davis, associate professor of biology; and Adriel Johnson, associate professor of biology.  The injured were Joseph Leahy, associate professor of biology, in critical condition; Luis Cruz-Vera, assistant professor of biology, in stable condition; and Stephanie Monticello, staff assistant, also in stable condition. They were taken to Huntsville Hospital.  Authorities have not ruled out the possibility of other suspects in connection with the shooting.  Investigators have interviewed Anderson's husband, Jim.  Anderson had been working at the university since 2003 and was up for tenure, Garner said. However, authorities wouldn't discuss possible motives or whether the issue of tenure may have played a role in the shooting.  Garner said the meeting at Shelby Hall was for faculty and staff in the sciences department, but he gave no other details.  The incident occurred shortly before 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), and residence halls were locked down 10 minutes later. An alert notifying the campus about the incident was issued at 4:42 p.m. CT.  Pressed on the amount of time that passed before a campus alert was sent notifying students and faculty about the shooting and the lockdown, university police Chief Chuck Gailes said the lag "didn't impact the safety of people on campus and in the building."  He said there is no specific timeframe that dictates how quickly such an alert is issued, but he said it would be an issue officials will look into.  University President David Williams said there would be a prayer service Sunday.  "We are a resilient community, and we know we will come together to overcome these difficult times," he said.  Williams said the campus would open for employees next week but there would be no classes.  Kourtney Lattimore, a 19-year-old sophomore studying nursing, was one of about 100 students who attended the suspect's anatomy class from 10:20 to 11:15 a.m. Friday., when the subject included neurons.  "Nothing seemed to be off at all," she said about her teacher, who wore a pink sweater in class. "We were all shocked, like, all of us just couldn't believe it."  Lattimore said her anatomy class was not the only one affected by Friday's events. Leahywho was wounded in the shootingtaught her infection and immunity class, she said.  Reached at the couple's home, Jim Anderson told CNN that his wife has an attorney whom he would not identify. He described his wife as a good teacher.  
 I turned 18 years old a week before Election Day in 1982 and was excited to exercise my newly earned right to vote. The first ballot I ever cast was for United States Senate. The race pitted a popular veteran Congresswoman against a political neophyte businessman who was the decided underdog. The underdog won. His name was Frank Lautenberg.  Sen. Lautenberg went on to win two more rough-and-tumble races before retiring. However, he jumped at the chance to return to Washington in 2002, when incumbent Bob Torricelli, dragged down by ethics allegations, announced that he wanted to withdraw less than two months before the election. In a move that became known as "the switcheroo," Democrats were allowed to put Lautenberg's name on the ballot instead. He then coasted to a double digit win and did the same in 2008.  Lautenberg was unabashedly liberal on social issues such as abortion, the environment, and gun control. His major legislative legacy, though, centers on transportation issues. He was a strong supporter of improving the country's mass transit infrastructure including funding Amtrak.  Memories of his father's early death attributed to unhealthy working conditions, though, kept Lautenberg fighting on the environmental front. In fact, he used transportation-related legislation to further his larger health and safety agenda. This included a smoking ban on airplanes, which was the first widespread limitation on using tobacco in public. He also created a de facto national drinking age by reducing federal highway funds for states whose minimum age was lower than 21.  What I will remember most about Lautenberg is that he always stood his ground. He was never shy about telling you why he was right and the other guy was wrong. A Lautenberg opponent once described him as a "swamp dog." While the senator initially bristled at the characterization, he took pride in having a street-fighter's reputation.  Some observers thought that the octogenarian met his match in 2010. That was when recently-elected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christiehardly a shrinking violet himselfcancelled plans to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River to New York City. Lautenberg came out swinging, calling Christie's decision one of "the biggest public policy blunders in New Jersey's history." The feud escalated, but Lautenberg would not back down. The two didn't really patch things up until they worked together to get federal aid for Hurricane Sandy recovery.  Lautenberg leaves tricky political question for Christie  Chris Christie now has the opportunity to appoint a replacement for Lautenberg. He is faced with the decision of either appointing a caretaker or giving an ally the ability to run as a sitting senator, while also clearing other Republicans from the field.  Coincidentally, the last time a New Jersey governor was faced with this decision was 1982, after a Democratic senator had resigned. At the time, New Jersey Republicans hadn't won a U.S. Senate seat in nearly 10 years. But Ronald Reagan had won the state by 13 points two years earlier and this was seen as a prime opportunity for the GOP.  Republican Gov. Tom Kean, who had won the closest gubernatorial election in state history only a few months before, opted to appoint a placeholder as a gesture of goodwill. As a result, it was Lautenberg who was able to squeeze out a come-from-behind 4-point win over Congresswoman Millicent Fenwick.  Christie is now faced with a similar prospectexcept that now the New Jersey GOP hasn't claimed a U.S. Senate win in more than 40 years. New Jersey law has two conflicting statutes on whether a special election has to be held this year or can wait until 2014. This could well end up in court.  If the election is held this year, whoever runs as the GOP standard-bearer for the remainder of the term could appear on the same ballot as the extremely popular Chris Christie. Considering the coattails potential of his almost certain re-election bid, there is no better time for Republicans to take this seat. If they win now, they will have a voter-tested incumbent running for a full term in 2014.  Of course, a contested senate race could bring out Democratic voters who were apathetic about the governor's race. This could cut into Christie's winning margin, which he hopes will be large enough to use as a selling point in a 2016 presidential run. The risk is particularly high if the Democrats field a well-known and well-funded challenger like Newark Mayor Cory Booker.  Booker has been working to establish himself as the heir-apparent for 2014which Lautenberg did not appreciate. A special election this year, though, may entice some of New Jersey's sitting congressmen to make a run without having to give up their House seats. So it could be a crowded field.  Christie can also call a special election for the senate seat before the gubernatorial election in November. This could be a free-for-all with many Democrats and Republicans getting into the fray, although Democrats would have a greater chance of holding onto the seat in this scenario.  None of the possible contenders, though, can claim the pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps, Greatest Generation personal story that shaped Frank Lautenberg's years of public service. Regardless of who fills the seat, one thing is clear: We will not see another "swamp dog" in the U.S. Senate.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Patrick Murray.

When I visited Princeton University on Monday, I took a walk past the Gothic dormitories on University Place before speaking about my career to a student seminarthe same one I took 10 years ago. Every time I see the entrance to Foulke Hall, I am overcome with disbelief that my friends and I aren't still students.  I consider it a cruel and unusual fact of life that there is a learned student living in my 171 square feet of paradise. But we all had to move on, and I am happy. I'm 29, I live in Atlanta, I work at CNN.com, and I did not marry a Princetonian.  Susan Patton's letter to the Daily Princetonian advising female students to find a husband on campus is surprising in its antiquated assumptions, for sure. Democratic strategist and CNN commentator Donna Brazile and others have taken it apart for its focus on marriage over career and its pointedness toward male-female relationships.  I don't fault anyone for wanting their college romances to continue, and I know some that have. But in my experience, parts of her letter are out of whack with the realities of college today.  I'm sure Princeton was different for the class of 1977, when Patton graduated. There were only 200 women. (Princeton began admitting women only in the fall of 1969!) She wrote that it was seen as "heresy" for her to say she wanted to get married and have children.  In my generation, the gender breakdown on campus is nearly 50-50, and I never felt even a little unwelcome as a woman. I heard people express the wish to have a career, marriage and children.  But it was far from the only thing we talked about. We talked philosophy, politics, religion, diversity, journalism, anthropology and the value of higher education; that's the level of dialogue that I craved when I applied in the first place.  Patton writes about how freshman women should be "a little nicer" to senior men, as though women never date men younger than themselves in college, and therefore, there are fewer to choose from as each new class graduates. As a freshman, I barely even knew any seniors. I've heard I seemed "nervous" and "spazzy" in my first year. I lived in fear of sounding stupid, getting subpar grades and locking myself into a major I didn't like. I was probably less emotionally prepared to have a serious relationship than at any other time in my college career.  Seven years after graduation, I understand how difficult a college marriage, the kind Patton suggests, could be. Many of my good friends from Princeton are in Ph.D. programs across the country or are practicing lawyers or doctors, teachers or nonprofit administrators or, like me, journalists. In order to have those great careers, though, a lot of us had to move around. We had to take jobs or attend graduate programs that were very far away from our idyllic New Jersey town and far away from each other.  I know some Princeton couples who did the long-distance thing and are now engaged or married. Let's be clear: They didn't get married in college, but the hard work of balancing two careers in flux can work out.  Personally, I couldn't have done it. Distance is painful. New surroundings change people. Time changes people. Other people change people.  This is not a Princeton problem. This is a 22-year-old problem.  There is this truth in Patton's letter: When you live in close proximity to thousands of other people your age, it's not unreasonable to hope that you will meet at least one other person who captures both your heart and mind. Intelligence is sexy, so a lot of really smart people are going to casually hook up or date or both.  Princeton is a place that brings together some of the most fascinating people I have ever encountered. Joyce Carol Oates gave me advice on my novel. Peter Singer taught me about animal cruelty. Science writer Michael Lemonick got me interested in what I do today. I got useful sex advice from Dr. Ruth Westheimer.  The experiences we had at Princeton do change our lives. They inspire inside jokes among friends and lovers that seem annoying or absurd to anyone else and make us think that we will always maintain some connection.  The school inspires a longing to return to that beautiful time when we were surrounded by thousands of people our age who also loved to learn. About 20,000 alumni come back to Princeton for Reunions every year, a testament to the memories of "Old Nassau."  Princeton is also notorious for breeding life partnerships. Pick up any copy of the Princeton Alumni Weekly magazine and you'll see the latest wave of marriage announcements. Love that happens in college can be incredibly powerful, solidified by uninterrupted time spent together and shared academic and social bliss.  But it's not everything.  I met my college sweetheart after my junior year, when I had been taking five classes per semester, running two campus magazines, writing for other publications and tutoring a second-grader. I literally planned every hour of every weekday except six hours of sleep.  He was two years youngerscandalous!and he respected me for all of my efforts. He even recognized my name from The Nassau Weekly.  I'd like to let you all in on a little secret: If you are following your intellectual passions, that itself makes you attractive. But don't do it to meet other people. Do it for yourself.  If I had married my college sweetheart, I would have dragged him to Atlanta, a city without the think tanks and rigorous public policy programs where he would thrive. Or I would have moved somewhere for him, and given these uncertain times in journalism, it is unclear whether I would have stayed in the field I love.  Inside the Princeton bubble, this may seem improbable, but you can find fascinating people who did not go to Princeton or any schools atop the U.S. News & World Report rankings. I know smart, funny people without four-year degrees. I have wonderful friends with great careers with degrees from non-elite schools. In fact, I have been dating one of these amazing people for five yearslonger than a Princeton education.  Disregarding the language in Patton's letter that's offensive to some, it's really not revolutionary. Of course, many people want to find their life partner in college.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say: It's OK to want to find your life partner in college. You're also going to be OK if you don't find your life partner there.  A true life partner is going to admire you for following your own intellectual or career passions anyway, so don't change yourself for someone else. Potential life partners are findableeven ones, as Patton says, "worthy of you."  I still miss my dorm, though, and I'm totally going to Reunions.  Elizabeth Landau is on Twitter at @lizlandau.

 Editor's note: John M. McCardell Jr., president emeritus at Middlebury College, is founder and president of Choose Responsibility, a nonprofit organization that seeks to engage the public in debate over the effects of the 21-year-old drinking age.  John McCardell says the 21-year-old drinking age isn't preventing widespread binge drinking.  One year ago, a group of college and university presidents and chancellors, eventually totaling 135, issued a statement that garnered national attention.  The "Amethyst Initiative" put a debate proposition before the public"Resolved: That the 21-year-old drinking age is not working." It offered, in much the way a grand jury performs its duties, sufficient evidence for putting the proposition to the test. It invited informed and dispassionate public debate and committed the signatory institutions to encouraging that debate. And it called on elected officials not to continue assuming that, after 25 years, the status quo could not be challenged, even improved.  One year later, the drinking age debate continues, and new research reinforces the presidential impulse. Just this summer a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry revealed that, among college-age males, binge drinking is unchanged from its levels of 1979; that among non-college women it has increased by 20 percent; and that among college women it has increased by 40 percent.  Remarkably, the counterintuitive conclusion drawn by the investigators, and accepted uncritically by the media, including editorials in The New York Times and The Washington Post is that the study proves that raising the drinking age to 21 has been a success.  More recently, a study of binge drinking published in the Journal of the American Medical Association announced that "despite efforts at prevention, the prevalence of binge drinking among college students is continuing to rise, and so are the harms associated with it."  Worse still, a related study has shown that habits formed at 18 die hard: "For each year studied, a greater percentage of 21- to 24-year-olds [those who were of course once 18, 19 and 20] engaged in binge drinking and driving under the influence of alcohol."  Yet, in the face of mounting evidence that those young adults age 18 to 20 toward whom the drinking age law has been directed are routinelyindeed in life- and health-threatening waysviolating it, there remains a belief in the land that a minimum drinking age of 21 has been a "success." And elected officials are periodically reminded of a provision in the 1984 law that continues to stifle any serious public debate in our country's state legislative chambers: Any state that sets its drinking age lower than 21 forfeits 10 percent of its annual federal highway appropriation.  But it's not 1984 anymore.  This statement may seem obvious, but not necessarily. In 1984 Congress passed and the president signed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act. The Act, which raised the drinking age to 21 under threat of highway fund withholding, sought to address the problem of drunken driving fatalities. And indeed, that problem was serious.  States that lowered their ages during the 1970s and did nothing else to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol witnessed an alarming increase in alcohol-related traffic fatalities. It was as though the driving age were lowered but no drivers education were provided. The results were predictable.  Now, 25 years later, we are in a much different, and better, place. Thanks to the effective public advocacy of organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, we are far more aware of the risks of drinking and driving. Automobiles are much safer.  Seatbelts and airbags are mandatory. The "designated driver" is now a part of our vocabulary. And more and more states are mandating ignition interlocks for first-time DUI offenders, perhaps the most effective way to get drunken drivers off the road.  And the statistics are encouraging. Alcohol-related fatalities have declined over the last 25 years. Better still, they have declined in all age groups, though the greatest number of deaths occurs at age 21, followed by 22 and 23. We are well on the way to solving a problem that vexed us 25 years ago.  The problem today is different. The problem today is reckless, goal-oriented alcohol consumption that all too often takes place in clandestine locations, where enforcement has proven frustratingly difficult. Alcohol consumption among young adults is not taking place in public places or public view or in the presence of other adults who might help model responsible behavior. But we know it is taking place.  If not in public, then where? The college presidents who signed the Amethyst Initiative know where. It happens in "pre-gaming" sessions in locked dorm rooms where students take multiple shots of hard alcohol in rapid succession, before going to a social event where alcohol is not served. It happens in off-campus apartments beyond college boundaries and thus beyond the presidents' authority; and it happens in remote fields to which young adults must drive.  And the Amethyst presidents know the deadly result: Of the 5,000 lives lost to alcohol each year by those under 21, more than 60 percent are lost OFF the roadways, according to the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse.  The principal problem of 2009 is not drunken driving. The principal problem of 2009 is clandestine binge drinking.  That is why the Amethyst presidents believe a public debate is so urgent. The law does not say drink responsibly or drink in moderation. It says don't drink. To those affected by it, those who in the eyes of the law are, in every other respect legal adults, it is Prohibition. And it is incomprehensible.  The principal impediment to public debate is the 10 percent highway penalty. That penalty should be waived for those states that choose to try something different, which may turn out to be something better. But merely adjusting the ageup or downis not really the way to make a change.  We should prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol in the same way we prepare them to operate a motor vehicle: by first educating and then licensing, and permitting them to exercise the full privileges of adulthood so long as they demonstrate their ability to observe the law.  Licensing would work like drivers educationit would involve a permit, perhaps graduated, allowing the holder the privilege of purchasing, possessing and consuming alcohol, as each state determined, so long as the holder had passed an alcohol education course and observed the alcohol laws of the issuing state.  Most of the rest of the world has come out in a different place on the drinking age. The United States is one of only four countriesthe others are Indonesia, Mongolia and Palauwith an age as high as 21. All others either have no minimum age or have a lower age, generally 18, with some at 16.  Young adults know that. And, in their heart of hearts, they also know that a law perceived as unjust, a law routinely violated, can over time breed disrespect for law in general.  Slowly but surely we may be seeing a change in attitude. This summer, Dr. Morris Chafetz, a distinguished psychiatrist, a member of the presidential commission that recommended raising the drinking age, and the founder of the National Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse admitted that supporting the higher drinking age is "the most regrettable decision of my entire professional career." This remarkable statement did not receive the attention it merited.  Alcohol is a reality in the lives of young adults. We can either try to change the realitywhich has been our principal focus since 1984, by imposing Prohibition on young adults 18 to 20or we can create the safest possible environment for the reality.  A drinking age minimum of 21 has not changed the reality. It's time to try something different.  It's not 1984 anymore.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John M. McCardell Jr.

WASHINGTON  The Department of Homeland Security is now collecting scans of all 10 fingerprints from foreign travelers entering the United States at Dulles International Airport, and plans to extend the program to all international airports in the country by the end of next year.  The programknown as United States Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology, or US-VISIThad previously used only two fingerprints. The 10-print system gives the United States the ability to compare fingerprints of travelers with criminal and terrorist databases compiled by the FBI, the Defense Department and others.  The new 10-print system was rolled out in late November at Dulles.  Speaking at an event at the airport Monday, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff touted the new technology: "We rely on biometrics, unique physical characteristics like fingerprints, to keep dangerous people out of the United States and at the same time to keep the lines moving so that travel is fast and convenient for legitimate citizens and visitors."  Chertoff said the two-fingerprint version of the program, which began in 2004, has already been successful, claiming that the program had stopped "almost 2,000 criminals and immigrant violators based on their fingerprints alone."  Canadians and Mexicans using government-issued identification cards are exempt from the program.  Privacy advocates such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center claim the system puts personal information at risk. A July 2007 Government Accountability Office report found that "systems supporting the US-VISIT program have significant information security control weaknesses that place sensitive and personally identifiable information at increased risk of unauthorized and possibly undetected disclosure and modification, misuse and destruction."  DHS insists that there have been no privacy breaches in the US-VISIT program.  Chertoff played down risks. "Moving to 10 fingerprints is completely consistent with, and in fact enhances, our ability to protect," he said. "We view privacy as a fundamental human right and preserving it is an integral part of our mission."  Travel and tourism groups fear that more barriers to international travel will make foreigners less likely to visit the United States. Discover America Partnership, a trade group representing the tourism industry, is cautiously supporting the program, but urges a greater effort by the United States to make foreign travelers aware of the program.  "While reasonable, we must also recognize that the 10-finger scan technology may be perceived as a barrier to entry," said Geoff Freeman, executive director of Discover America Partnership, in a news release. "We must balance this and other barriers with clear communications and a welcoming message." E-mail to a friend  
 The Arctic as we know it may soon be a thing of the past.  Musk ox in the Arctic check the spread of shrubs to the High Arctic, but promote grass growth.  That's the message from Eric Post, lead scientist of a new report into the effects of climate change on life in the Arctic.  Published in "Science" magazine, Post and his team of international scientist conducted the study during the fourth International Polar Year that ended in 2008.  "It seems no matter where you lookon the ground, in the air, or in the waterwe're seeing signs of rapid change," said Post in a press statement.  The report found that flora and fauna of the Arctic are responding in various ways to the region's changes in climate over the last 150 years, and more recently the 20 to 30 years where seasonal minimal sea ice coverage has declined by 45,000 square kilometers per year.  With the decline in sea ice and snow, animals usually seen at lower latitudes are being found in more northerly regions, including red foxes that have been displacing native Arctic foxes.  View the gallery of Arctic life affected by climate change   The report found that some native Arctic species have also benefited from climate change, including wild reindeer on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard.  With less snow cover and a longer growing season, these non-migratory reindeer have taken advantage of the increased plant abundance, with the result that reindeer populations and their ability to reproduce are up, while mortality is down.  But other animals are not adapting well to rising temperatures and the effect on delicate ecosystems.  Migratory caribou in low Arctic Greenland and elsewhere are declining in number as they have not been able to keep their calving season in synch with changes in plant growth.  With the decline in caribou comes a knock-on effect to native Inuit hunters, according to the report's authors. Hotter summers could result in more insects and parasites that prey on the caribou, which could then also reduce the annual caribou harvest by local indigenous peoples.  "Inuit hunters at my study site in Greenland have all but given up on hunting caribou there. What will be the next component to disappear from their traditional lifestyle, a lifestyle that has worked for thousands of years?" said Post.  Iconic Arctic animals dependent sea ice, including Pacific walrus, ringed seal, hooded seal, ivory gull, narwhal and polar bear, are faring especially badly, said the report.  The researchers found that polar bears and ringed seals, both of which give birth in lairs or caves under the snow, lose many newborn pups when the lairs collapse in unusually early spring rains. These species may be headed for extinction, said the report.

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras The head of the Organization of American States said Friday he has found no willingness among leaders of Honduras' interim government to return President Jose Manuel Zelaya to power.  OAS Secretary General Jose Insulza doubts Honduras' new leaders will restore ousted President Jose Zelaya.  "They have, for the moment, no intention of reversing the situation," Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza told reporters.  He said he had reached that conclusion after speaking Friday with members of the Supreme Court, among others.  Insulza also rejected assertions by the interim government that the change in leadership was not really a coup d'etat.  "I don't know what else you would call it when a group of military take a president out of power and sends him to another country," he said.  At the end of Insulza's comments, Deputy Foreign Minister Marta Lorena Alvarado said Honduras is willing to withdraw from the OAS.  "If the Organization of American States doesn't deem Honduras worthy of membership of the Organization of American States, then Honduras would renounce, with immediate effect, the inter-American charter."  Vice Chancellor Martha Lorena de Casco also said Honduras was ready to leave the OAS, which she called a political organization rather than a tribunal of justice.  "Honduras will defend its sovereignty," she said in a televised response.  Zelaya was ousted in a military-led coup Sunday and sent to Costa Rica in his pajamas. The same day, the Honduran Congress voted to install Roberto Micheletti as interim president.  That sparked international condemnation, with the OAS on Tuesday passing a resolution calling for Zelaya's reinstatement by Saturday and threatening to suspend Honduras from the group.  Zelaya has said he will return this weekend with presidents of other OAS member countries, despite Micheletti's vow to have him arrested for violating the country's constitution if he does so.  On Friday, thousands of people assembled in front of the presidential residence in Tegucigalpa, where Micheletti praised the armed forces for their efforts and offered a different version of events.  "We must tell the world that there was no coup d'etat here," he said, his voice hoarse. "It wasn't a coup! It wasn't a coup!"  He promised that the nation would revert to a democracy, but did not say when.  "Here, in front of Honduras and the entire world, I guarantee we will have free elections, as soon as we decide when," he said.  Micheletti has promised not to run in elections slated for November.  "You may choose any candidate from any party," he told the crowd. "I want to tell you that I am governing for all political parties. I am governing for the poor, for the businessmen, for the rich, for the children and for all the people of Honduras."  Though the two sides appeared far apart, a compromise might be possible, said Jennifer McCoy, an Americas expert at the Atlanta, Georgia-based Carter Center.  "The options are that neither side backs down and that President Zelaya shows up tomorrow and the police are there waiting to arrest him."  If Zelaya returns accompanied by international figures, the result would be "awkward," she said.  McCoy added there could be "some kind of compromise, including mutual guarantees." One such scenarioZelaya's promise not to pursue legal action against the coup plotters in exchange for their agreement to step aside and not to pursue his Cabinet ministers who are in hiding.  McCoy praised U.S. President Obama for supporting Zelaya without qualification.  "By taking the principled stand for democracy that he took in this case in favor of a government that is an ally of Venezuela, he did not let politics intervene. This is a change from the previous administration," she said.  McCoy was referring to the tacit U.S. approval that was given to the coup that in 2002 briefly toppled leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has been a consistent U.S. critic.  "It helps to recuperate the pro-democracy credential of the United States in this hemisphere," she said.  Meanwhile, Amnesty International accused the new government Friday of intimidating media workers.  "Recent reports suggest that journalists who have published news stories on the crisis or covering the issue of protests and scores of detentions have been intimidated," it said. "Prosecutors have also reported threats on account of their attempts to verify human rights abuses during protests."  At the center of the dispute was a referendum that Zelaya had vowed to carry out last Sunday even after the country's supreme court and congress declared it would be illegal. The nonbinding referendum could have opened the door to the creation of a constitutional assembly to modify the country's charter. Opponents accused Zelaya of having sought to rewrite the constitution to allow him to run for re-election. Zelaya denied that was his intent.  However, international support for the new government has been virtually nonexistent.  On Thursday, the European Union announced that all its ambassadors had left Honduras.  Also Thursday, the U.S. State Department said it was suspending some aid programs to the country. Earlier, the U.S. military, which has trained Honduran forces for years, postponed some planned exercises with the Honduran military until the situation in the country settles down.  Zelaya narrowly won the presidency in 2005 with 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio "Pepe" Lobo.  After 18 years of nearly uninterrupted military rule, Honduras returned to civilian control in 1981. Since then, the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people, about 70 percent of whom live in poverty.  Military interventions were once common in Latin America, but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s.  Before Sunday, the only other barracks revolt this decade was the unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against Chavez, when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement.

 Editor's note: Alejandra Lopez-Fernandini is a senior policy analyst in the Asset Building Program at the New America Foundation, a Washington-based think tank that seeks innovative solutions across the political spectrum.  Alejandra Lopez-Fernandini says Americans have no choice but to increase the amount they save.  WASHINGTON As the economy slows, millions of Americans will cut their budgets to stay afloat. This generates conflicting impulses: If I skip that morning coffee and granola, will my thriftiness put my local coffee shop out of business?  Will that force America's granola farmers to lay off workers? What's a budget-conscious, patriotic and hungry girl to do?  Not to worry, saving a few dollars now will not prolong the recession. And, more important, spending all your discretionary income will not end the recession.  It's true that John Maynard Keynes' "Paradox of Thrift" suggests that, even while saving is beneficial to an individual, too much aggregate savings could deepen an ordinary recession. But in these extraordinary times, where banks and not just businesses are in desperate need of cash, this economic rule may not fully hold.  More important, individuals need savings to be prepared for unanticipated expenses and income losses, especially now. The reality is that there is no bailout coming to you. And those getting the bailout might not be willing to lend to you, anyway. So now is the time to save.  The money you save is your own personal safety net, what you tap when you have an unanticipated expense like a car repair or when you're between jobs, as many Americans find themselves nowadays.  The past decade has seen Americans saving at historically low levels; we've substituted plastic for the piggy bank. But the days of cheap and easy access to credit have come and gone. We all need to save not because we want to but because we have to.  For decades, our country's economy has flourished, but it relied too heavily on debt-driven consumer spending to power its growth. Excessive household debt, coupled with stagnating incomes and little to no personal savings, now places America in a precarious position.  Compared with the 19 other major industrialized economies, the United States ranks dead last for personal savings. That's right, in 2003, the United States was the least thrifty nation among the G-20.  Why is it important that we save more as a nation? Savings offers us the protection we need to make it through hard or uncertain times and to pay for important future needs such as a home, education or adequate retirement. Savings also creates pools of capital for investment purposes (who will fund the next neighborhood coffee shop?) and to keep interest rates low.  It appears the current recession has scared us back to saving; we are no longer spending all of our disposable income. To ensure that the hopeful trend continues, government and employers should adopt a new generation of savings policies that are both innovative and simple.  Common sense, along with research from the emerging field of behavioral economics, tells us why we aren't saving more already:  1) We like instant gratification  Whether it's iPhones or our paychecks, we want everything, and we want it now. We are so short-term-oriented that many of us would rather have a fatter paycheck now than set aside some of that happiness, even if the funds will be greater in the future.  2) We tend to procrastinate  Once we start something (or fail to start something), it's really hard to change course. And we'd prefer a hassle-free world. Who doesn't, right? When it's hard just to figure out how to start saving, most people won't. However, the flip side is that when it's easy to start saving, a lot more people will. Think about current retirement savings. How many of us would open an account and make regular deposits if an employer didn't take it right out of our paychecks?  When it comes to savings, we need someone to save us from ourselves. Smart savings policies should be automatic and utilize smart pre-made choices, or defaults. It would require action to NOT save. Of course, this type of policymaking underscores the importance of making the default choice a good one (an adjustable-rate mortgage with no down payment would be an example of a bad default).  Employers can easily help their employees save for a rainy day, leveraging the payroll system and direct deposit to automatically send a small percentage of their paychecks to a savings account.  This type of unrestricted savings is especially valuable for individuals who have limited liquid assets and who may otherwise be forced to meet emergency cash needs with high-cost payday loans.  A truly transformative savings policy to broaden the base of American savers would encourage it from birth with Children's Savings Accounts. These "start in life" accounts would be "seeded" up-front with a modest initial deposit ($500), progressively funded for children born into lower-income households and restricted for specific asset-building uses like higher education, purchasing a home or starting a small business.  For the economic health of the next generation, the United States should join the U.K. and Singapore, and others who are offering such lifelong savings accounts, and get some skin in the thrift game, too.  We know it's plenty hard to save; it feels a lot like we're taking away what we've rightly earned. Taking advantage of windfall payments such as tax refunds is important, and so is removing the temptation to spend all of that refund. Tax filers can pre-commit a portion of their refund before it reaches their pocket to up to three accounts (including savings accounts!) with IRS Form 8888.  Having accessible savings is critical to our personal and economic security.  We must reorient the savings policy discussion to include the needs of shorter-term savers and consider policy that would make savings automatic and universal at birth.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alejandra Lopez-Fernandini.

Jack Dorsey might be an unassuming characterbut he's also a tech titan who reinvented the way the world communicates. And now he's on a mission to do the same for commerce.  The co-founder of Twitter and chief executive officer of Square met with CNN's Maggie Lake to share his vision on how mobile payments will change the world of commerce.  Square, which enables the virtual exchange of cash and goods, is designed to "give time back to our sellers, give time back to our merchants, so they can really focus on building their business up," Dorsey told CNN.  "We don't want this to just be about payments, we don't want it to be about transactionsthose are all mechanical things that should be so intuitive that they disappear," he said.  Dorsey is criss-crossing North America to promote Square and talk to small business owners, whom he sees as key to reinvigorating economic growth.  "What I think is great about technology, and every technology that exists, [is that] it increases the number of people who can participate, in our case commerce," Dorsey said. "And, it increases the velocity that they can participate."  Square, Dorsey added, enables a businessperson to "start as an individual, you can start selling something, and then you can grow."  Square is competing in a jammed arenamobile payments already exist via Paypal and othersbut Dorsey told CNN its pitch is different.  "A lot of folks are looking at parts of the equation and Square is looking at the entire thing," Dorsey said.  "If you're not solving for the entire experience, you are putting those seams in front of the customersand the customers see that. And they have all these friction points, and it actually slows down the business."  Square aims to have "one, end-to-end, great, frictionless experienceand that's been our focus from day one," Dorsey said.  Transactions through Square have tripled over the last 18 months, a success that nevertheless remains overshadowed by the Dorsey's involvement in Twitter.  The micro-messaging social network, which has shifted how people and businesses communicate, is valued at up to $11 billion and will go public next month.  However, Dorsey said Square is an "entirely new canvas," dealing as it does with commerce rather than communication.  Both ideas are "fundamental to humanity....both are extremely complex and both companies are trying to make each simple." But, Dorsey added, " they are very very different problem sets and they require different solutions to each one."  
 TOKYO, Japan Japan's Prime Minister Taro Aso announced a historic 15 trillion ($150 billion) stimulus package Friday aimed to turn around the recession in the world's second largest economy.  Japan's Prime Minister Taro Aso has announced a $150 billion stimulus package.  Steeped in a recession, with a surge in bankruptcies and sentiment among its largest manufacturers at a record low, Japan has seen unemployment reach a three-year high. The stimulus plan is meant to keep Japan's economy from cracking open, coalition party officials told CNN. It is the biggest-ever supplemental budget to boost the ailing economy.  Japan has been hit hard by the global financial slump. Although Japanese banks were spared the brunt of the credit crisis, the drop in exports to the United States has sent the country into its worst recession since World War II.  Aso needs the package to boost Japan's economy and his government's popularity.  "This could help save his life as prime minister," said Satoru Ogasawara, a Tokyo-based economist for Credit Suisse. The Aso administration's approval rating fell below 10 percent two months ago, but has been buoyed by the stimulus package and the recent North Korea rocket launch, Ogasawara said.  If approved, the package could add two points to the country's gross domestic product, Ogasawara said. But its long-term impact remains an open question.  "It will help the economy from collapsing from this point ... [but] unless the package improves productivity or increases demand, it will be a short-term fix," Ogasawara said.  Jesper Koll, president and chief executive of TRJ Tantallon Research Japan, said the stimulus package was unlike the 12 trillion injections into the economy in the past eight months.  "This is the first designed with real business input, and that's reflected in the package," he said, referring to a series of meetings Aso held with business leaders last month. "That's outside the normal technocratic, bureaucratic fix. ... It isn't just pork-barrel money for the boys."  Koll cites details of the plansuch as tax breaks for gift-giving, environmentally friendly cars, or measures to increase employment in health careas a step forward.  "This goes way beyond grand-standing fiscal policy. It's very specific. For Japan, that's something," he said.  Still, Japan now has one of the highest amounts of public debt in the world - a rate which could approach 200 percent of GDP next year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  "The government has since spent billions and billions of dollars to support the economy," Kirby Daley, a strategist for brokerage Newedge, said. "Japan has been trying this and has now gone into almost two lost decades and will likely enter a third lost decade if they continue down this policy path. It has not worked in Japan. It will not work again."  Among the package's highlights: 1.9 trillion for unemployment benefits and the promotion of job sharing. 3 trillion to boost struggling companies. 1.6 trillion to promote green initiatives, such as the purchase of environmentally friendly cars and energy-efficient electronics. 2.6 trillion for infrastructure, such as airport runways, train networks and road extensions. 1.7 trillion for health and welfare.  The proposed stimulus package helped a rally in Japanese stocks this week, with the Nikkei 225 Average briefly breaking the 9000-point level for the first time in three months on Friday morning trading. The Nikkei hit a 26-year record low last month.

NAIROBI, Kenya More than 100 people were killed and several dozen wounded when an overturned petrol tanker exploded in Kenya early Sunday, authorities said.  The blast is the second multi-fatality incident in the east African country in four days. A supermarket fire in Nairobi on Wednesday killed at least 27 people, with another 57 still missing.  The tanker explosion occurred near Molo, a small town in the Rift Valley Provinceabout 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the capital, a spokesman for the Kenyan police said.  The tanker overturned along a highway spilling gallons of gas which hundreds of residents rushed to scoop up, said Titus Mung'ou of the Kenyan Red Cross.  "People were lining up trying to get the fuel," he said. "They were siphoning off petrol for over an hour. Some people had drilled holes in the tanker and were charging a fee for the assembled crowd."  The vehicle exploded about an hour later, apparently after one of the residents lit a cigarette or started a fire at the crash site, Mung'ou said.  Four policemen, who were trying to control the crowd, were believed to be among the victims, Mung'ou said.  Another 117 people were wounded in the blast, police said. The figures are expected to rise, officials said.  The Red Cross sent more than 80 people to help with rescue efforts. Those who were seriously wounded were flown to a hospital in Nairobi.  Meanwhile, the death toll from last week's Nairobi supermarket fire rose to 27 on Sunday, the Red Cross said.  Rescue workers found the latest victims as they searched through the rubble of the scorched structure in downtown Nairobi.  The fire ignited Wednesday afternoon during a somewhat busy hour in the 24-hour Nakumatt supermarket.  Police launched a criminal investigation to look into allegations that security guards locked people into the burning building. Employees of the supermarket refused to comment on the allegations.  The fire angered Kenyans for what they perceived as a lack of disaster preparedness.  Emergency numbers failed to work and water ran out during attempts to put out the fire, said Mung'ou of the Kenyan Red Cross.  "There is the need to strengthen the capacity in handling fires," Mung'ou said.  
 Washington The Supreme Court is scheduled to tackle some key cases in its 2014-15 term, which starts Monday.  More than three dozen appeals are currently on the docket. Perhaps three dozen more are expected to be added in coming months. The caseload for the term is usually settled by February, with the term effectively ending in late June.  Other important appeals that may yet be added cover such issues as same-sex marriage, affirmative action, abortion rights and further litigation over President Obama's health care reform law.  Cases already on the Supreme Court docket:  FREE SPEECH: Elonis v. United States  AT ISSUE: The limits of policing "speech crimes" in the Internet age, especially laws aimed at protecting those harassed or bullied online. What is the level of proof needed to convict someone of making criminal threats?  THE CASE: Anthony Elonis was convicted in federal court for threatening language in Facebook posts aimed at his estranged wife, judges and law enforcement. Some were expressed as rap lyrics, which Elonis said were "therapeutic" for dealing with emotional pain. But prosecutors said he crossed a dangerous free speech line.  THE ARGUMENTS: Elonis' lawyers argue that the government did not prove that his statements showed a "subjective intent to threaten," based on Supreme Court precedent. But the Justice Department replied that his online comments were serious in nature, not a case of "careless talk, exaggeration, something said in a joking manner or an outburst of transitory anger."  THE IMPACT: A ruling here could have broader implications for free speech amid the explosion of popular and often anonymous social media. Are sites like Twitter in the same category as more conventional news links, and are general threats made online different from those made in person?  RELIGIOUS FREEDOM: Holt v. Hobbs  AT ISSUE: An inmate wants to grow a -inch beard in accordance with his beliefs, citing rights under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.  THE CASE: Gregory Holt, also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad, is a Muslim who filed a handwritten petition with the court. Arkansas prison policy allows only a "neatly trimmed mustache."  THE ARGUMENTS: Corrections officials say beards can hide contraband and make it hard to identify prisoners, so such security concerns deserve deference from courts. But Holt's lawyersbacked by the Obama administrationsay that a less restrictive policy should be adopted.  THE IMPACT: Holt has the support of both civil liberties and religious freedom groups, who have often been traditional foes. Last term, the justices ruled that some for-profit companies whose owners expressed strong Christian beliefs had a First Amendment right to oppose Obamacare health mandates providing contraception coverage for their workers.  EXECUTIVE POWER: Zivotofsky v. Kerry  AT ISSUE: The constitutionality of a federal statute that explicitly directs the secretary of state how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a Consular Report of Birth Abroad and on a passport. Does the law impermissibly infringe on the President's power to recognize a foreign nation?  THE CASE: Thirteen-year-old Menachem Zivotofsky is a U.S. citizen, and his parents want his birthplace listed as "Jerusalem, Israel," but U.S. diplomatic officials said they could use only "Jerusalem." The status of the holy city remains in dispute, and U.S. policy is reflected in the fact that it does not currently recognize any country as having sovereignty over the region.  THE ARGUMENTS: The justices three years ago allowed the lawsuit by the family to proceed. It is not the first time Congress and the White House have clashed over the holy city, which both Israelis and Palestinians consider their capital: The U.S. Embassy remains in Tel Aviv, over U.S. lawmakers' objections.  THE IMPACT: This dispute may be fact-specific, but the federal government is thinking of the bigger political and diplomatic picture. State Department officials would not comment on the record in a pending case, but President Barack Obama has acknowledged that the stalled peace process has created divisions in that region and in the United States.  WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION: Young v. United Parcel Service  AT ISSUE: The duty of employers to provide workplace accommodations under the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act.  THE CASE: Expectant mother Peggy Young's request for a "light duty" assignment from her regular work as a truck driver was denied, even though the company allegedly had done so for other workers temporarily unable to perform their functions. Young, who worked in suburban Washington, then had to take unpaid leave, with a subsequent loss of medical benefits.  THE ARGUMENTS: The company and Young focus on two different readings of the act and whether UPS' "pregnancy-blind" policy on the ability to work protects it from liability.  THE IMPACT: The ruling could add significantly to the evolving canon of judicial oversight over job discrimination claims.  Cases that may be added to the Supreme Court docket in coming months:  SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: Various pending appeals from state officials in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin  AT ISSUE: Whether state bans on the ability of gays and lesbians to legally wed violate the Constitution's equal protection guarantees.  THE CASE: Thirty-one states do not allow same-sex marriage. Legal, political and social momentum favoring the right has accelerated in the past year after the Supreme Court in a peripheral case struck down part of a congressional law that recognized marriage for federal purposes as between only one man and one woman.  THE ARGUMENTS: Gay rights groups say the bans are discriminatory and single out homosexuals for disparate treatment. But many states say that the votersnot the courtsshould decide such matters and that traditional marriage encourages opposite-sex couples to raise children in a stable family unit.  THE IMPACT: A final ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court would be a landmark on many social levels. The justices could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework, potentially striking down every current same-sex marriage ban. Or they could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, allowing state legislatures to sort it all out, for now.  ABORTION RIGHTS: Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health Services v. Abbott  AT ISSUE: A challenge to a Texas law that requires doctors to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of a clinic where they are providing abortion services.  THE CASE: Other states have adopted similar laws, and lower courts have issued conflicting rulings.  THE ARGUMENTS: Abortion-rights supporters say the provision is unconstitutionally restrictive and has forced more than a third of centers that had provided abortions in Texas to close. State officials, including Gov. Rick Perry, have said the law ensures that clinics are no operating under "dangerous conditions."  THE IMPACT: Another part of the Texas law is also being reviewed by a federal appeals court: the requirement that abortions be provided in only walk-in hospital-type surgical centers, which could force closure of many smaller women's health clinics. 11 other states have similar restrictions. If the case is accepted for review, the justices will again tackle one of the most contentious social issues.  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: Fisher v. University of Texas  AT ISSUE: A renewed challenge to the school's race-conscious admissions policies.  THE CASE: Abigail Noel Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she a high senior in Sugar Land, Texas. Fisher claims that she was turned away because she is white. The school defends its policy of considering race as one of many factorssuch as test scores, community service, leadership and work experiencedesigned to create a diverse campus.  THE ARGUMENTS: The high court first heard this case two years ago, issuing a ruling with no clear winner. The justices affirmed the limited use of race in the admissions process but made it somewhat harder for institutions to apply such policies to achieve diversity. The case went back to a federal appeals court for further scrutiny, which decided in the school's favor in July.  THE IMPACT: The Fisher dispute will now probably be reviewed once again by the Supreme Court in coming months, with the potential for a definitive 21st-century ruling. The issue of race and education offers vexing questions of competition, fairness and demographicsand what role government should play when promoting political and social diversity.  
	 'More than 100 people were killed and several dozen wounded when an overturned petrol tanker exploded'
As outrage over the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin continues to grip the nation, key questions remain unanswered over what happened the night of February 26 as conflicting accounts are given by witnesses and attorneys for both sides.  What is known is that Martin, wearing a hoodie, ventured out from his father's fiancee's home in Sanford, Florida, to get a snack at a nearby convenience store. As he trekked back to the home with a bag of Skittles and an Arizona iced tea, he was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer. Martin was unarmed. Zimmerman has said he acted in self-defense.  CNN spoke to a witness to the shooting for a second time Friday, who offered new details about what she saw. Zimmerman's attorneys, for their part, were quick to knock down her statements.  Here's what they said:  Who yelled for help?  A recording of a 911 call made the night of the shooting captured someone pleading for help. Zimmerman has said he was yelling for help, according to his family members and his account to authorities. Martin's relatives have said they are certain the voice heard on the 911 call is Martin's.  "From the very beginning and I still do feel that it was the young boy," the witness, who wants to remain anonymous, told CNN Friday.  The witness lives in the apartment complex where the shooting occurred and saw the incident through her window.  She described the cries for help as "devastating, desperate," and something "that will really always stay with me."  When pressed if she could determine who was yelling, the witness said "it was the younger, youthful voice (rather) than it was the deep voice I heard when they were arguing."  Zimmerman's attorneys jumped on the witness' characterization of Martin as "the young boy."  "I'm not sure when she came to that conclusion," said attorney Hal Uhrig, noting that when news of the shooting first broke, pictures of Martin as a 12-year-old were the first to circulate.  "The pictures you've put up tonight show a 6 foot 3 boy who was 17 years old," Uhrig said, pointing out that teenage boys can have voices that range from high to as low as a grown man. A police report listed Martin's height at six feet.  Audio experts Tom Owen and Ed Primeau, who analyzed the 911 recordings for the Orlando Sentinel, said they don't believe it is Zimmerman who is heard yelling in the background of one 911 call. They compared those screams with Zimmerman's voice, as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier. In that call, in response to the 911 operator's question, Zimmerman described a "suspicious" black male, who ended up being Martin.  In describing her questioning by investigators, the witness remembered expressing that she should have done something more, in retrospect, after hearing the cries for help.  "The lead investigator said to me kindly, 'Well, if it makes you feel any better, the person that was yelling for help is alive,'" she recalled.  Who was on top of whom during the scuffle?  Zimmerman says he killed Martin in self-defense after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk, according to an Orlando Sentinel report that was later confirmed by Sanford police. One of the responding officers saw a wound on the back of Zimmerman's head and a bloody nose, and noted that his back was wet, indicating he had been lying in the grass, according to the police report.  Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, racially profiled the teen, who was black, and ignored a police dispatcher's directive not to follow him. Zimmerman's attorneys interpret the call differently, and say the operator did not order Zimmerman not to follow.  "I know it was very dark, but I really would have to say that I thought it was the larger person on top," the witness said, referring to the heavier build of Zimmerman.  Craig Sonner, another Zimmerman attorney, questioned how the witness could determine the identities of those on the ground at that time of night and from her vantage point.  "I think it was dark, and I don't think she's sure what she saw," Sonner said.  The police investigation:  The Sanford police department has come under intense scrutiny for its actions following the shooting, and protesters have called for the firing of police Chief Bill Lee, who stepped aside temporarily last month amid criticism.  The witness declined to characterize her questioning by investigators as "in depth," instead saying "I just kind of told what I saw and heard."  She noted that when she offered to show the investigators where she saw the scuffle occur, she was told, "Nah, we don't need to see it."  She added that two phone calls to the lead detective have gone unanswered.  Her attorney, Derek Brett, said a follow-up visit on behalf of the state attorney's investigation on Wednesday yielded only 15 minutes of questioning.  "It was very general," Brett said, adding that had he been in the investigators' position, he would have had her recount her story again.  The state attorney's office declined to comment Friday, citing the ongoing investigation.  Sanford police did not respond to requests for comment Friday.  What will happen next?  A grand jury is expected to convene next week and could take up the case. Whether a grand jury will choose to indict, Sonner said: "we don't know."  Until now, only friends and relatives of Zimmerman's have come forward to offer his side of the story. Uhrig said Zimmerman "would love to be able to do that right now," but due to threats to his safety and the possibility of charges, he can't.  "There's going to be a time, hopefully in the fairly near future, where he'll have an opportunity to tell the public exactly what happened," Uhrig said.  Until then, Sonner cautions against jumping to conclusions.  "Everybody wants to know what happened, but we need to take a step back and let the evidence come out," he said.

BAGHDAD, Iraq Clashes between Shiite militias left dozens of people dead and hundreds wounded in Karbala and Baghdad, prompting Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr on Tuesday to call for calm, his spokesman said.  Iraqi special forces patrol Karbala on Monday as thousands of Shiite pilgrims stream into the holy city.  A curfew and weapons ban were in effect and Shiite pilgrims were evacuated from the southern Iraqi city of Karbala, where fighting has killed up to 50 people and wounded 247 others, the Iraqi Interior Ministry said.  The Iraqi Army had taken control of the city by early Wednesday, Iraq's national security adviser said.  "The situation is quiet now, but nervous and tense," Mowaffaq al-Rubaie said in a phone call from Karbala.  Referring to the clashes in Karbala and Baghdad, he said, "They are potentially dangerous and can develop into something more serious."  The violence erupted Monday night in Karbala, where hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were attending a Shiite religious festival. The fighting spread to Baghdad on Tuesday.  Watch how the fighting began   Five people were killed in Baghdad, where al-Sadr's followers torched six offices belonging to the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, authorities said.  Al-Sadr has called for calm, banned further fighting and urged members of the Mehdi Army militia to guard the Islamic Council offices and officials, according to Sheikh Ahmed al-Shibani, a senior al-Sadr aide in Najaf.  Al-Sadr also called for an investigation into the clashes and for those behind the attacks to be punished, his spokesman said.  The attacks were accompanied by fighting between the Badr Organization and the Mehdi Army. The Badr Organization, part of the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, has been incorporated into Iraqi security forces throughout the country. The Mehdi Army is the militia of al-Sadr.  In Sadr City, where two of the political offices were burned, the Iraqi army called in reinforcements and air support while battling the Mehdi Army, an Interior Ministry official said.  The Mehdi Army also set fire to the Dawa Party's office in Kadhimiya, an Interior Ministry official said. Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki is a member of the Dawa Party.  Shiite pilgrims in Karbala were celebrating Sha'abaniya, the birthday of Imam al-Mehdi, the 12th Imam, whom Shiites revere. The celebrations were to peak Tuesday and Wednesday.  The pilgrims in Karbala were evacuated from the city center, and a full curfew was imposed, said Brig. Gen. Abdul Kareem Khalaf, an Interior Ministry spokesman.  There is also a ban on bicycles, motorbikes and pushcarts.  A curfew also was in effect in nearby Najaf, a Shiite holy city to which many pilgrims fled after the Karbala fighting began, Najaf police said.  The fighting was apparently spurred by a security measure that banned people from carrying weapons into Karbala, an Interior Ministry official said. The al-Sadr loyalists refused to give up their guns, leading to clashes between the Sadrist fighters and security forces protecting the shrines, an Interior Ministry official said.  The Mehdi fighters have accused the security forces of being members of the Badr Organization.  Pilgrims and members of the security forces are among the casualties. Local officials convened Tuesday to discuss how to defuse the situation.  Tensions have been high between the armed wings of the major Shiite political movements. Targeted assassinations and battles between the Badr Organization and Mehdi Army have been prevalent in recent months.  Other developments:   A deputy oil minister and four other kidnapped employees of the Iraqi Oil Ministry were freed Tuesday after two weeks in captivity, the oil ministry said. The deputy oil minister, Abdul Jabber al-Wagga, and the four general managers are in good health and have returned home, the ministry said.   Several hundred U.S. and Iraqi troops converged on Iraq's Diyala province, killing 33 insurgents and restoring a city's water service, the U.S. military said. The troops carried out an air assault Monday in the Gobia community to restore water in nearby Khalis. The military said "water is currently flowing unimpeded."   A suicide bomber detonated an explosive vest Monday in the courtyard of a mosque in Falluja, killing 12 people, including an imam known for speaking out against Iraqi militants, an Interior Ministry official said. Two of his sons also were killed in the blast, according to the official.   Coalition forces "killed eight terrorists and detained 11 suspected terrorists" during raids targeting al Qaeda in Iraq leaders, the military said Tuesday. The raids, spanning two provinces northeast of Tikrit, targeted a senior-level adviser with links to international terrorist Khalid al-Turki, the military said. Al-Turki was killed during a June 23 operation.   A "highly sought weapons facilitator" was arrested Tuesday in Baghdad, the military said. The individual is suspected of distributing bombs and smuggling weapons from Iran to Iraq, the military said.

 Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford apologized for "a lot of stupid things" Sunday but said he won't resign despite reports that police have video that purportedly shows him smoking a crack pipe.  "Friends, I'm the first one to admit I am not perfect. I have made mistakes. I have made mistakes, and all I can do right now is apologize for the mistakes," Ford said during an appearance on Toronto radio station CFRB.  "I want to move forward, but I also know to move forward I have to make changes in my life, which I can assure you that I will do," he added. "I love the work I do, and I'm going to keep doing it."  Ford co-hosted CFRB's "The City" with his brother Doug, a member of Toronto's city council. In response to callers, he said his apology referred to two previously reported incidents where he appeared to have been drunk in public and "a lot of stupid things, all self-inflicted" that he didn't detail.  He has repeatedly denied using crack and has not been charged with any crime. In May, two media outlets began to report that Ford was recorded on video last winter using crack cocaine. Thursday, Toronto Police Chief William Blair told reporters that investigators had recovered a video from a computer seized during a drug investigation that featured images "consistent with those that have previously been reported in the press."  Blair said Ford appears in the video but would not detail what he's doing. Ford said Sunday that he hasn't seen the video, and he called on Blair "to release this video for every single person in the city to see."  Toronto mayor says he won't resign despite possibly damning video  "That is the right thing to do, and Chief, I'm asking you to release this video now," Ford said. "Whatever this video shows, folks, Toronto residents deserve to see it, and people need to judge for themselves what they see on this video."  Ford was elected to a four-year term in 2010 and has touted tax cuts and streamlined government under his administration. He told listeners that he wanted to finish his term and let voters decide whether they want to keep him in 2014.  "Unfortunately, I cannot change the past. I can just move forward and learn from the past, which I assure you I am doing," he said.  Most of the calls taken on the show were from self-described supporters, some of whom urged Ford to step down.  "I am not a hater, and we all make mistakes, and none of us are perfect," one woman said. "I just personally believe that maybe you need some time away and come back fresh." Another told Ford, "I want you to take a medical leave. Just a medical leave .The city will survive. You need it ... Please listen to me. Your family deserves better."  But others urged him to hang tough: "I think you're just getting railroaded by the corrupt media," another caller said.  In May, the website Gawker and the Toronto Star newspaper published stories saying their reporters had seen 90 seconds of a cell phone video showing the 44-year-old Ford, as the Star described it, "inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe."  Later in the videoas described by the Staran "incoherent" man both the Star and Gawker claimed to be Ford ranted about a number of subjects. The video, which has never been released publicly, shows a "clearly impaired mayor," two reporters who say they saw the video wrote in the Star.  Then, police recovered video from deleted files on a computer hard drive that was seized during a drug and gang investigation, according to a 465-page report by Toronto police disclosed last week. The report includes hundreds of redacted pages and states that police sources believe the photo of Ford that first surfaced in May is taken in front of a "trap" house used to "chop" crack.  Police documents also detail evidence used to obtain a search warrant for a man suspected of drug trafficking, Alexander (Sandro) Lisi, who police say is the mayor's friend as well as his driver. Photos collected by police show Ford and Lisi together on a number of occasions, including attending a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game, according to the documents.  Lisi was arrested Thursday and charged with extortion, according to a police statement. He is accused of using extortion to retrieve a recording, it said.  Blair said a digital video in police custody will be shown in court in an effort to support the charge against Lisi, who was released after a bail hearing Friday, his lawyer, Seth Weinstein, said.

A preseason soccer match in Austria had to be abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters invaded the pitch and started attacking players from Israeli team Maccabi Haifa.  Clashes between a group of youths carrying Turkish and Palestinian flags and the Maccabi team broke out at the end of Wednesday's friendly game with French side Lille.  War has been raging in the Middle East for more than two weeks now, with Hamas rockets being fired into Israel, which has responded with continued air strikes on Gaza and a ground incursion into Palestinian territory.  The conflict has now claimed 732 Palestinian lives, many of them children according to the Gaza Health Ministry, while Israel has reported 35 deaths32 of those soldiers.  Resentment and anger spilled onto the football pitch in the Austrian town of Bischofshofen in the Tyrol region where Maccabi regularly spends a period training before its domestic campaign begins.  A group of 20-25 flag-waving people had shown up for the match, according to Itamar Chizik, general manager of the team based in the northern Israeli city of Haifa.  "They were shouting all the game," Chizik told CNN. "This is OK if they want to shout, if they want to demonstrate, but in the 85th minute they went onto the pitch directly to our players, no doubt to engage.  "It was a little bit using of force and then the police came and it took about 10 minutes before we succeeded to take all our players back to the dressing room. Nobody was injured.  "We came here for sport, for football. Our club is well known, we have in our club hundreds of Muslim players, in the A team we have five Muslim players as well as Jewish players and Christian players.  "We're not dealing with politics, we are a football team. In Haifa, we are living with peace with all religions. You can imagine by yourself the reason why (this group) was trying to spoil our camp.  "I believe most of them don't even know the reason they demonstrate for. But it is not our problem, we came to play football and that's itvery clear, very simple."  Maccabi has twice made the group stages of the European Champions League, in 2002-03 and 2009-10, and has won the Israeli league 12 times.  The team is scheduled to play two more matches before its 10-day stay in Austria ends on Sunday. Its domestic season starts in August.  The Israeli Football Association told CNN it is still considering whether to ask European soccer's governing body UEFA to investigate, calling the incident one of "pure violence."  "We know UEFA are against any kind of political activity," said head of communications Shlomi Barzel. "We are not against protest, it is OK if you come to the game to protest but it is different once they go down to the field.  "We hope this is something that won't happen again."  Chizik praised the reaction of local Austrians to the incident, many of whom apologized to him and the team, and said it was the first time it had encountered anything like this since heading to the region for its preseason preparations.  And he also said no-one from Maccabi would be asking UEFA to investigate.  "The police here are doing their investigation, it is a local eventnothing to do with football," he explained. "We have very good relations with the Austrian teams and with the Austrian Football Association.  "It's not a question for football, it's a political question probably and we are not involved in politics at all. The policemen took care to investigate and do everything that should be done to make sure it doesn't happen again."  Maccabi is one of the big four clubs in Israel alongside Maccabi Tel Aviv, Hapoel Tel Aviv and Beitar Jerusalem.  It has a reputation for being an inclusive club and Chizik said he was "totally disappointed" football and politics had been meshed together on Wednesday.  "Wherever we go in Europe or wherever we play, we never, never merge together politics and football," Chizik said.  "Never has any problem come out, we are all friends living together with peace.  "We are all proud Israelis and we do care what is happening in Israel, but we never mixed sports with politics and we are very happy and proud about it at our club.  "We never thought this event should come to sport or football but it is over."  CNN contacted the Palestinian Football Association, which said it was preparing an official response to the incident.  French club Lille said in a statement: "Although we regret and disapprove any form of violence, mainly those events that occasionally involve sports demonstrations, LOSC remains a football club and a sports entertainment company and it's not our duty to comment on political matters."

 Virginia Beach, Virginia Emergency calls highlight the confusion in a Virginia Beach, Virginia, neighborhood after a Navy fighter jet crashed last week, with one woman reporting that a pilot was on her patio awaiting medical aid.  Authorities released recordings of the calls on Monday, three days after the F/A-18 Hornet slammed into an apartment complex about two miles from the naval air station where it took off.  "Nobody's here, and I keep calling and there's no ambulance," one woman told a 911 dispatcher from her condominium a few blocks from the crash site. She said one of two fliers who ejected from the stricken warplane was outside, that he was conscious and that she had already called for help.  "He's still on my patio, but they told me to evacuate, and there's other guys there helping him," the unidentified woman says. "My neighbor's there helping him."  Seven people, including the two-person crew of the Hornet, were injured when the aircraft crashed into a Virginia Beach apartment complex on Friday. But there were no fatalities, a fact that Adm. John Harvey called a "miracle" over the weekend.  "A Navy plane just went down on 24th Street," a man says in another call to dispatchers. "It hit an apartment complex and I saw the, um, the pilot bail out. The pilot did bail outI saw itbut it hit the apartment complex."  The aircraft experienced a "catastrophic mechanical malfunction" during takeoff from Naval Air Station Oceana on Friday, raining jet fuel over Virginia Beach before plunging to the ground, according to residents and Navy officials. It landed upright and in flames in the middle of the courtyard of the Mayfair Mews apartment complex, setting five surrounding buildings on fire.  "There's a terrible fire at the Mayfair Mews apartment building. ... Oh my God! It's like something keeps exploding or something," another woman tells dispatchers.  The jet carried a student pilot in the front seat and an experienced instructor behind him, and the leakage of jet fuel was "one of the indications that there was a mechanical malfunction," Navy Capt. Mark Weisgerber told reporters. The plane was part of a training squadron at Oceana and was not carrying live ordnance.  The Navy said Monday that investigators have recovered the flight recorder from the Hornet. The device, which records flight data but not cockpit voices, has been sent to a Navy air base at Patuxent River, Maryland, for analysis, Navy officials said in a written statement Monday afternoon.  The wing and part of the fuselage of the plane were being moved to Oceana for further study, but the remains of the jet's twin engines will remain at the crash site for now as investigators study them, the U.S. Atlantic fleet's aviation arm reported.  The Navy expects to finish removing most aircraft debris by the end of the week as part of its investigation. And the service will soon begin cutting compensation checks to the people who lost their homes in the crash, said Rear Adm. Tim Alexander, commander of the Navy's Mid-Atlantic region.  "We are committed to doing the right thing to address the needs of these families, who through no fault of their own have endured an incredible hardship," Alexander said. "We owe it to everyone affected by Friday's accident to help them get their life back together."  Initial payments will begin at $2,300 per person to cover immediate needs, such as housing, meals and clothing. The amount will increase for additional family members. Counseling and legal services also will be available, Alexander said.  Residents who completed claims by Saturday could receive payments by Monday.  CNN's Barbara Starr and Sandra Endo contributed to this report.

Japan's national football team will not play at the prestigious Copa America tournament in July due to the earthquake and tsunami that caused devastation in the island nation last month.  The 2011 Asian Cup champions had been one of two countries invited to take part as guests at the 12-team South American event, due to be held in Argentina from July 1-24.  But Japan Football Association president Junji Ogura traveled to Paraguay on Monday to meet his South American counterparts and ask that the "Samurai Blue" not participate alongside Mexico.  "He believes the priority now is to try to save lives and reconstruction," CONMEBOL spokesman Nestor Benitez said in a statement on Monday.  "On top of that, the Japanese FA has organizational problems due to damage to infrastructure."  Marvelous Mourinho record fallsbut will it ever be beaten?  Japan's J-League has been suspended for five rounds until April 23 to save the electricity used to stage night matches, as the country tries to rebuild with more than 11,000 people killed and over 15,000 missingwhile problems still remain at a crippled nuclear power plant.  Japan had been due to play in Group A with Argentina, Bolivia and Colombia, but a team from the Central American region such as Honduras or Costa Rica may now be invited.  "We had asked to be invited to the South American championship, first of all. Therefore, it is not for us to make a decision unilaterally," Ogura told Japanese media before heading to Asuncion.  The Mexico team have been regular participants at the Copa since 1993, while the U.S. have been invited to take part three times.  
 The biological mother of a missing 7-year-old Oregon boy has written an open letter to her son saying, "I am sorry that I was not there to protect you."  "I am so soooooo sorry that this has happened," Desiree Young wrote to Kyron Horman in a letter that was released Monday to NBC News.  "I will never be able to forgive myself for being so many hours away when you needed me the most. I pray that you come back to me because I am afraid that I can't live without you."  The letter comes more than two weeks after the boy disappeared on June 4.  The boy's stepmother, Terri Horman, said she last saw Kyron walking down the hallway towards his classroom at Skyline Elementary School, police said. Cell phone records indicate she may not have been at the school at that time, according to a report in People Magazine. Authorities refused to comment on the report.  In the emotional letter, Young speaks directly to her young son. "When you come home I will show you all of [the] things that everyone did for you, just to find you," she wrote.  "There are literally hundreds of thousands of people that don't know you and yet they pray for you every night. They know how much I miss you and need you and they just want to bring you home to me. There are so many wonderful people working on this case and they are going to find you soon.  "I would give anything to run my fingers through your short hair again. I miss having you to hug anytime I want. Night time is always hard for me. I miss you so much and want you back here so that I can protect you from all of the horrible things in this world. I just can't believe that you aren't still with us," she writes.  "Your life has been really great and I know that it is [not] done yet. A long time ago you saved my life and now I am going to do the same for you. Our lives will never be the same after this. I love you very much!"  Authorities have labeled the case a criminal investigation, On Friday, they released a flier seeking information on Kyron's stepmother. The flier includes pictures of Terri Horman and a form to be filled out and returned by anyone who was at the school the day Kyron vanished.  "At any time did you see Terri Horman at or near the school?" was among the questions in the form.  Capt. Jason Gates of the Multnomah County sheriff's department issued the following statement Friday on the decision to request information on Kyron's stepmother:  "Detectives work in this case is exhaustive and they, along with Kyron's family, are asking for the community's assistance regarding anyone who saw not only Kyron, but also who may have seen Terri Horman and/or the truck she was driving that morning. Terri is the last person known to have seen him before he disappeared."  In a brief phone interview with CNN, sheriff's spokeswoman Lt. Mary Lindstrand said the focus of the investigation is not on Terri Horman.  "We're looking for every bit of information that we can," Lindstrand said. "We are not in a position to name anybody a person of interest."  Kyron was wearing dark cargo pants and a black T-shirt with the "CSI" logo on it at the time of his disappearance. He is 3-foot-8, weighs 50 pounds and has brown hair and blue eyes.  Anyone with information is asked to call the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office.

(CNN Student News)September 25, 2009  Quick Guide  Terror Indictment - Learn about the latest charge against a suspect in a terrorism investigation.  Pittsburgh Summit - Hear about some of the challenges facing the world's leading economic powers.  20 Years of News - Look back at some headlines you've seen over 20 years of CNN Student News!  Transcript  THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.  CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR:  Celebrating 20 years of commercial-free news for the classroom, this is CNN Student News! This show is awesome. I'm Carl Azuz. You know how we look now; over my shoulder, you can see our sweet graphics from the 1980s. A look back is coming up after our top stories. Let's go!  First Up: Terror Indictment  AZUZ: First up, a new charge against Najibullah Zazi, one of the suspects arrested in connection with a terrorism investigation. He's been indicted on a charge of conspiracy "to use weapons of mass destruction." Zazi was arrested last weekend. This is all part of a Justice Department investigation into an alleged plot to set off explosives in the U.S. In a hearing yesterday, another suspect, Ahmad Afzali, who was arrested on charges of lying to authorities, was released on bail of $1.5 million. But his travel is being restricted.  Security Council  AZUZ:  Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council is looking to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. All 15 countries who are members of the group voted for a resolution that would tighten control on nuclear materials. The measure also supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The presidency of the Security Council rotates between the member nations. This month, the U.S. has it, which is why President Obama ran yesterday's meeting.  Pittsburgh Summit  AZUZ:  After the U.N. summit, he and other world leaders headed to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for a gathering of the G-20, a group of the world's leading economic powers. They're not the only ones in town, though. Protesters have flocked to the city to take part in demonstrations. Yesterday, an unauthorized march turned violent as protesters clashed with police officers. As for the G-20, the global economy has improved since the last time it got together. But as Ed Henry reports, there's still a lot of work to do.  ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: When these 20 leaders last met, it was spring in London and the global recession was still catching fire. But as President Obama wrapped up his first big moment on the international stage, he declared they were putting out the flames.  U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We finished a very productive summit that will be, I believe, a turning point in our pursuit of global economic recovery.  HENRY: Five months later, there are signs the recession is coming to a close. But unemployment is still sky-high, helping to fuel protesters already waiting for the leaders in Pittsburgh.  (SOUND OF PROTESTERS)  HENRY: The president acknowledged to CNN's John King that unemployment may get worse in the next few months, which is why he will be pushing his counterparts to sign on to a specific pledge to make the global economy more balanced.  OBAMA: We can't go back to the era where the Chinese or the Germans or other countries just are selling everything to us, we're taking out a bunch of credit card debt or home equity loans, but we're not selling anything to them.  HENRY: But getting the Chinese to sign on will be difficult, especially after Mr. Obama slapped a tariff on Chinese tires, which raised questions about whether leaders are reneging on free trade promises they made in London.  STEVEN SCHRAGE, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC & INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: So, is the United States going to be standing up and stopping this slippage? Or is it going to be further pushing the world down towards trade conflicts and possibly a downward spiral of new types of protectionism?  HENRY: Another potential dispute: European leaders continue to push hard for a crackdown on bonuses paid to bankers. And while Mr. Obama last week reiterated his call for broader reform of Wall Street, his hand has been weakened by inaction in Washington.  SCHRAGE: The U.S. is really handicapped by the fact that its own reforms haven't gotten out of Congress. So, while they can talk about these broad reforms, until the United States is really active, it's hard for them to set the course.  Disaster Declaration  AZUZ: Catching up on a couple other headlines now, starting with the recovery process in Georgia following this week's deadly flooding. President Obama has issued a Federal Disaster Declaration for four counties in the state. That will free up money and aid to help with the relief efforts. Requests for federal aid in other counties are being reviewed.  Kennedy Replacement  AZUZ: And the governor of Massachusetts has picked Paul Kirk, who you see here, to fill the U.S. Senate seat left empty by the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy. He's only taking over the seat temporarily, however. A special election for a permanent replacement is set for January. Kirk has said he doesn't intend to take part in that process.

 Search crews have recovered the bodies of the flight captain and a steward from the Air France flight that crashed off the coast of Brazil.  A Brazilian diver floats on wreckage of Flight 447 earlier this month. The search for more debris continues.  The two flight members are among the victims that have been identified, Air France said in a statement Thursday.  About a dozen victims have been identified among roughly 50 bodies recovered from the crash of Flight 447, which killed 228 people on June 1, authorities in Brazil said this week.  Crews continue to search for bodies, wreckage and flight-data recorders that apparently rest deep on the ocean floor. Data from the recorders may be crucial in helping investigators determine what caused the plane to crash.  Watch more wreckage recovered from crash   Autopsies conducted on some of the 50 bodies found so far show they suffered broken bones, including arms, legs and hips, Brazilian authorities have told French investigators, according to Paul-Louis Arslanian, head of the French accident investigation board.  Such injuries suggest that the plane broke apart in midair, experts have said.  Asked about that theory, Air France Chief Executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon told France's RTL radio this week that he would not go that far.  "What I know is that the investigators would like to know the causes of death," Gourgeon said. "That knowledge of causes of death will better clarify what exactly happened. Were the victims killed before the impact, or during impact?"  Searchers have found dozens of pieces of debris in the water and think they know the general location of the wreck, but Arslanian said this week that there is a chance the entire aircraft may never be found.  Air France plans to pay relatives of the victims an initial compensation equivalent to about $24,500, or 17,500 euros, for each victim, Gourgeon has said.  The airliner said this week that it has been in touch with about 1,800 relatives of the people who died when the Airbus A330 crashed, but that it has been difficult tracing the relatives of all 228 victims.  "The modern world is different and we often have only a cell phone, and as you can imagine, this cell phone is unfortunately in the aircraft," Gourgeon said. "So we probably (will put in) more hours to access all the relatives."  The company is also providing families with counseling, he said.  The were 32 different nationalities present on Flight 447.

A 65-year-old man's remains were stashed in containers across South Florida, police said Thursday, releasing the victim's identity one day after charging another man in his murder.  Police began looking into the case last month after finding body parts strewn around three counties in the southern part of the state.  On Thursday, Fort Lauderdale police said in a statement that those remains belonged to Warren Danzig, whose last known mailing address was in Davie, about 10 miles southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale.  Police contended a day earlier that Jamie Saffran killed Danzig sometime between November 2 and November 5 and then dismembered his body. Saffran then stole Danzig's credit card and used it to pay his own daughter's college tuition and buy tires for his Jeep, authorities said.  According to the Broward County Medical Examiners Office, Danzig died from "blunt force trauma."  The police affidavit says the gruesome discoveries of his remains began in Fort Lauderdale on November 6, when police responded to a call about a suspicious container. Inside that bucket they found human legs and arms, poorly masked by concrete.  Additional agencies became involved in the investigation as more body partswhich included the victim's head and torsowere found in similar containers in three counties, the affidavit says.  "As the multijurisdictional investigation progressed, further evidence led investigators to suspect Saffran's involvement in the homicide," Fort Lauderdale police said.  During a search at Saffran's home, authorities discovered a shovel covered with concrete and a sledgehammer "that presumptively tested for human blood," the affidavit says. They also found two bags of cement and several sharp tools, it says.  DNA testing conclusively linked the strewn body parts to Danzig, authorities say.  Saffran told detectives that he and the victim had been friends for several years. He added that the two even shared a home mailing address, although Saffran claimed that Danzig more recently lived in the Dominican Republic. According to the police report, Saffran said the two last saw each other about October 31.  InSession's Adam Blank contributed to this report.  
 Authorities said there was no danger at Texas A&M University after a report of a gunman on campus Thursday turned out to be a person with a replica weapon.  A partial lockdown and campus-wide alert system went into effect after a bus driver spotted what he described as a man carrying what looked like an AK-47, officials said.  The alert, known as a "Code Maroon," was issued at 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET). It asked those on campus to "seek safe shelter until further notice."  About an hour and a half later, an all-clear was given and business resumed as normal at the university, officials said.  Texas A&M, located in College Station, Texas, has an enrollment of more than 49,000.  It is the home of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, and also home to the Texas Aggie Corps of Cadets, the largest uniformed ROTC body outside of the service academies. Some members of the Corps are on special drill teams and are known to train with mock rifles on campus.  Rudder Tower, where the alleged armed man was spotted, is one of the most heavily trafficked parts of campus.  CNN's Mariano Castillo, Marylynn Ryan and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.

As Manchester City's delirious fans spilled onto the pitch to revel in their team's remarkable English title win on Sunday, the celebrations also kicked off thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi.  In one cafe in the United Arab Emirates capital, some fans stood and danced, one even leaped onto a table, while others simply smiled contentedly as they puffed on their shisha pipes.  City's dramatic 3-2 win over Queens Park Rangers was beamed to an estimated global audience of 4.7 billion in a powerful advert for just why Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan splashed out $320 million to buy the English Premier League club in 2008.  The title was won at the Etihad Stadium. The players wore shirts emblazoned with the Etihad Airways logothe Abu Dhabi-based airline.  The title-clinching goal was scored by record $62 million signing Sergio Aguero in the dying seconds of the game.  It was, in short, the brightest indicator yet of the Middle East's growing influence within European football.  "For a lot of the people here, they say that they didn't even follow the Premier League until Manchester City was bought by the Abu Dhabi group," reported CNN's Leone Lakhani in Abu Dhabi, "so you can imagine they've been extremely happy with the results the entire year.  "It elevates the country's emergence as a major sporting power."  Owner Sheikh Mansour, a member of the country's ruling family, wasn't at the stadium on Sundayhe has been to only one match at the Etihadand hasn't yet commented on the club's first title win in 44 years.  But it was Sheikh Mansour who invested more than $600 million on players like Aguero, Yaya Toure and Carlos Tevez, and helped the perennial underachievers beat neighbors Manchester United to the title on goal difference.  The incredible images on Sunday delivered the message on his behalf.  Etihad Airways, which carried a message of congratulations to City on its website on Monday, reportedly paid more than $600 million for stadium naming rights and shirt sponsorship over 10 years, but the benefits are huge.  "When you win national and international titles, the exposure to a very, very relevant target audience for us couldn't be better," Peter Baumgartner, chief commercial officer of the airline, told CNN.  While so many European countries are in financial difficulties, it isn't just Abu Dhabi taking advantage of football's global appeal.  Dubai airline Emirates has a high-profile stadium and shirt sponsorship deal with Arsenal, and the Dubai-based Royal Emirates Group took over La Liga club Getafe last year.  Getafe managed an 11th-place finish in Spain, seven places behind the league's other Middle Eastern-owned club, Malaga.  Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nassar Al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, bought out Malaga in 2010 when the modest club had never finished higher than seventh in the top flight. Veteran Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy helped the club to a fourth-place finish this season and a place in the Champions League qualifiers.  Emboldened by the country's shock winning bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Qatar has since worked on spreading its influence across Europe.  Qatar Sports Investment (QSI) reportedly paid $220 million over five years to put the Qatar Foundation name on Barcelona's shirt , but it is in France where the tiny natural gas-rich nation is really making its presence felt.  QSI took over Paris Saint-Germain last summer, hoping not just to awake a sleeping giant of the French game but to create a new European powerhouse.  "This is our strategy to bring PSG on long term to be one of the biggest in the world," club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi told CNN in March.  To that end, PSG brought Brazilian Leonardo on board as sporting director, paid a French record $56 million to sign Javier Pastore and hired Carlo Ancelotti as coach.  PSG might miss out on the league titletrailing Montpellier by three points with one game remainingbut the potentially exciting end to the season at least justifies al-Jazeera's investment in the Ligue Un domestic television rights at a reported 510 million a year until 2016.  Al-Jazeera also has the international rights to the league, as well as most of the UEFA Champions League rights in France from 2012, and there are even suggestions that the broadcaster could make a bid for the UK rights for the English Premier League.  It is all designed to establish Qatar as a global sporting power, which the country hopes will be confirmed in 2022 when it hosts the biggest single-event sporting competition in the world.  The growing appeal of Qatar's domestic league has also been highlighted in recent times, with former Spain and Real Madrid striker Raul swapping German Bundesliga side Schalke for Al-Sadd in the Qatar Stars League.  For now, though, it is Abu Dhabi in the spotlight as it joins the blue half of the city of Manchester in joyous celebration.  
 LOS ANGELES, California Singer Natalie Cole underwent kidney transplant surgery at a Los Angeles, California, hospital Tuesday, according to a statement from her publicist.  Natalie Cole holds one of the Grammys she received in February for "Still Unforgettable."  Cole, daughter of legendary singer-actor Nat King Cole, has been receiving kidney dialysis three times a week since September, the statement said.  Cole was "resting comfortably" at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, it said.  "Ms. Cole's physicians have advised her to postpone her summer tour dates as she recuperates for the next three to four months," it said.  Rescheduled concert dates will be announced soon for Cole's tour, which is in support of her current double-Grammy-winning CD, "Still Unforgettable."

Venice has suffered its worst flooding in 22 years, leaving some parts of the historic Italian city neck-deep in water, reports said Monday.  A woman wades through high waters in Venice's Piazza San Marco.  Water burst the banks of the coastal city's famed canals, leaving the landmark Piazza San MarcoSt Mark's Squareunder almost a meter of water at one point, news agency ANSA reported.  Strong winds pushed waters to a high of 1.56 meters (5 feet 2 inches) at 10:45 a.m. local time, prompting the city government to issue warnings to the public, the agency said.  The flood level began to drop soon afterwards, prompted by a change in the direction of the wind.  Previous highs include 1.58 meters in 1986 and 1.66 meters in 1979, the news agency said.  Watch more about the flooding   Photographs showed people wading through inundated piazzas and waves lapping over waterside cafe tables.  Venice, built around a network of canals and small islands, has for years been trying to tackle the problem of floods that have regularly blighted the city.  In 2007, the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO warned Venicea designated World Heritage Siteis under threat from rising sea levels caused by climate change.  See pictures of Venetians wading through flood waters.   It said that unless the problem is tackled, Venice could be flooded daily and water levels would permanently rise by 54 centimeters in the city by the year 2100.  
 Frenchman Thomas Voeckler has taken the yellow jersey from Norway's Thor Hushovd after a dramatic ninth stage of the Tour de France which was marred by a series of crashes which led to two of the race favorites pulling out.  Voeckler, who led the race for 10 days in 2004, finished second to Spain's Luis-Leon Sanchez at the end of the hilly 208km run from Issoire to Saint-Flour, which saw the riders tackle seven climbs in the Massif Central region.  Both Voeckler and Sanchez were members of a six-man breakaway group which formed at the 50km mark after a succession of attacks.  Rui Costa holds on for Tour de France win  However, as the peloton began closing the gap on the six leaders, a huge pile-up on a descent at 102km saw a number of riders hit the ground at speed.  Among them were Astana team leader Alexander Vinokourov, a previous Tour of Spain winner, and Omega Pharma-Lotto leader Juergen Van Den Broeck, who finished fifth in last year's Tour.  The 37-year-old Vinokourov, who had already announced his decision to retire at the end of the season, suffered a broken leg after tumbling a few meters down a ravine, while Van Den Broeck sustained a fractured shoulder blade.  Key Garmin domestique Dave Zabriskie was also forced to retire, to add to the list of riders that have crashed out of this year's race, which include Bradley Wiggins, Tom Boonen and Janez Brajkovic.  More drama was to follow when Team Sky's Juan Antonio Flecha, one of the breakaway riders, was clipped by an accompanying French TV car, sending him and Johnny Hoogerland flying, with Dutchman Hoogerland spectacularly going head-over-heels onto some barbed wire that surrounded a field on the side of the road.  Although both riders continued the race, eventually finishing well adrift of the peloton, their bloodied bodies indicated that they may not be on the start line for Tuesday's 10th stage following Monday's rest day.  Voeckler, who began the day in 19th place, now holds the race lead after finishing five seconds behind Sanchez, but nearly four minutes ahead of the peloton.  The Team Europcar rider lies 1:49 ahead of Rabobank rider Sanchez, who is 37 seconds clear of Cadel Evans in third place.  "When you only have two minutes on a rider like Cadel Evans in the overall, you have to be realistic," Voeckler told the official Tour de France website.  "I'm not a dreamer, I will just fight and give all that I can. I know it's impossible for me to keep the lead for 10 days like in 2004 but one thing is suretomorrow I can keep the jersey because it's a rest day!" he added,  Hushovd's brave hold on the yellow jersey ended when he trailed home in 82nd place, 6:47 behind Sanchez, and he now lies 24th in the overall standings.  Defending champion Alberto Contador came home 12th, in the same group as the overall contenders, and continues to creep up the standings to 16th position overall.  However, the three-time winner was another to crash on Sunday and told reporters he was suffering from some pain in his knee, although he will have time to rest it on Monday's rest day.

It's hard to imagine a scene more gruesome and disturbing than the one Londoners encountered on an inner-city street Wednesday.  A person hacked to death, lying in a pool of his own blood. His assailants standing nearby, covered in blood and brandishing gore-soaked knives and meat cleavers as they spew violent rhetoric. A car smashed into a lamppost a few yards away.  Most bystanders kept their distance, understandably.  Yet one woman directly confronted the apparent murderersin fact, she jumped off her bus and rushed to the scene when she saw what looked like a car accident, then stuck around and tried to engage both attackers in conversation even after she realized what was going on. The woman, a 48-year-old mother of two named Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, later said she was trying to talk them down and keep them from hurting anyone else, especially children. Why did she put herself on the line when so many others stayed away?  We don't really know enough about Loyau-Kennett to be able to say for sure; perhaps we never will. History is filled with heroes, from Oskar Schindler to Paul Rusesabagina of Hotel Rwanda fame, whose life histories couldn't have predicted the extraordinary things that they later did.  Cub scout leader, ex-teacher confronted London terrorist  But what we do know, thanks to social psychology, is that what separates people like Loyau-Kennett from the rest of us is often extremely subtle. In fact, research suggests that many of us, perhaps to our own surprise, have the potential to find our own inner hero. What often makes the difference between a bystander and an "upstander" are the particulars of a crisis situation and how those details interact with a person's background.  For instance, decades of research on the "bystander effect" has shown that even good, moral people fail to take action when confronted with an emergency. One famous study found that the only factor that determined whether bystanders stopped to help someone in need was whether they were in a hurry.  Other research shows people are less likely to help when they're part of a crowd: They assume either that someone else will take responsibility or that there must not really be a crisis at all if no one else has acted yet. Taking action would mean going against the norm, breaking from the herd; they don't want to rock the boat. The bigger the crowd, the more likely all crowd members will do nothing.  Yet there are exceptions. Research suggests, for example, that when people can be made to feel a personal connection to a victim, they might intervene in a situation that they would otherwise ignore. One British study even found that people were more willing to help an injured stranger if that stranger were wearing the jersey of their favorite soccer team.  There are other exceptions as well. Research by Princeton psychologist John Darley, who pioneered the study of the bystander effect, has found no clear personality profile distinguishes the upstanders from the bystanders. More important, according to Darley and others, is whether people can recognize a crisis and feel they have the skills to help.  That finding resonated in London when Loyau-Kennett, trying to explain her actions, cited her role as a Cub Scout leader, mentioning that she had to learn first aid for the position. It was her knowledge of first aid that initially prompted her to get off her bus, thinking that she could help the victim she saw lying on the ground.  Similarly, after Wesley Autrey-- aka the Subway Heroleaped onto New York City subway tracks to save someone who'd fallen in front of a train back in 2007, many observers later pointed to Autrey's Navy service to explain why this otherwise unexceptional man sprang to action while everyone else simply watched.  In their own extensive analysis of what makes a hero, psychologists Zeno Franco and Philip Zimbardo suggest that people who don't succumb to the bystander effect are sometimes people who generally don't adhere to social norms and conventions. That means they're prone to intervene and take positive action when no one else will. But it may also mean they're prone to break other rules.  Franco and Zimbardo cite the story of Jabar Gibson, who was hailed as a hero after he drove 70 people to safety from the flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina, commandeering an abandoned school bus. Gibson thought to do something bold that others wouldn't do; he also had an extensive criminal record, which has grown in the years since.  Does this mean we can expect Ingrid Loyau-Kennett to break the law in the not-too-distant future? Hardly. But it does challenge the notion that there's a distinct category of exceptional people who are heroes, elevated above the rest of us.  Franco and Zimbardo have argued that deifying heroes like thiswhat they call "the myth of the 'heroic elect'"has the perverse effect of making us blind to our own heroic potential. If instead we believe we're capable of heroism ourselves, we'll be better prepared to realize that potential and snap into action if and when our time comes.  So science still hasn't gotten to the bottom of stories like Ingrid Loyau-Kennett's. But perhaps its greatest insight so far is that her story could be ours.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Marsh.  
 Susan Boyle, a 48-year-old unemployed charity worker who became an international sensation after her audition for "Britain's Got Talent" in April, can now lay claim to a new achievement.  Her debut CD, set to come out on November 23, has become the most pre-ordered CD in the history of Amazon.com, the online retailer said Thursday.  Eager fans began ordering copies of the CD, "I Dreamed a Dream," as soon as its release was announced late summer, pushing it to the top of the online retail chart ahead of Whitney Houston's much-anticipated comeback CD.  "One of the things that is so unique about Susan Boyle is her ability to touch people around the world," said Steve Barnett, the chairman of Columbia Records, in a statement.  Before she sang during her audition in April, the unassuming single woman with a loose mop of curly hair drew snickers from the audience, including notoriously hard-to-please judge Simon Cowell.  The scowls and eye-rolling were replaced by wild cheers as soon as she sang the first line of "I Dreamed a Dream."  Even though she eventually lost out to a dance troupe in the TV competition, her pitch-perfect rendition of the "Les Miserables" number catapulted her into an overnight sensation with a string of global television appearances.

NEW YORK New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday he is asking the city council to change the office's two-term limit to allow him to run for a third term.  "If the City Council should vote to amend term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers to look at my record of independent leadership and then decide if I've earned another term," Bloomberg said in a news conference at City Hall.  The mayor, a billionaire businessman, is credited with helping New York City recover economically after the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, which felled the twin towers of the World Trade Center and killed more than 2,700 people.  Elected for the first time just two months after the attacks, Bloomberg pumped tens of millions of dollars of his own money into that campaign, as well as his bid for re-election in 2005.  "As a businessman with expertise on Wall Street and finance and as a mayor who has balanced budgets and delivered services, I can tell you that the enormity of the challenges ahead should not be underestimated," Bloomberg said. "I care deeply about sustaining the progress we made and finishing the job the voters elected me to do."  Watch Bloomberg talk about seeking a third term   New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr., a Democrat considered a leading candidate to replace Bloomberg in next year's election, said he was "extremely disappointed" in the mayor's announcement.  "I have always taken the Mayor at his word, particularly when he said on multiple occasions that altering term limits through a council vote would be disgraceful," he said. "Let me be clear: Today's announcement constitutes an attempt to suspend democracy. We should not undermine the will of the voters."  Bloomberg, an independent since 2007, wants city council to change the current two-term limit law and offer voters another choice.  "As always, it will be up to the people to decide, not me," he said.  Standing beside Bloomberg at a later news conference regarding rebuilding at the World Trade Center site, New York Gov. David Paterson said he'd "be delighted to see [Bloomberg] running for a third term."  The mayor then jokingly pledged that he would not seek a fourth.  In 2005, Bloomberg easily defeated his Democratic opponent, Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, who was never able to gain any traction against the popular incumbent.  Before becoming mayor, Bloomberg ran Bloomberg L.P., a global communications company that provides news and financial services to thousands of businesses worldwide.  
 The bizarre case of a North Korea-bound ship being seized and searched following a violent struggle on the Panama Canal sounds like a deleted scene from the Cold War.  But officials fearing some sort of modern-day Cuban Missile Crisis could only have been relieved to find out that what Cuba describes as an assortment of antique Soviet weapons discovered aboard the shipburied under 255,000 sacks of brown sugarare more suited to a Cold War museum than they are to being used as weapons in the 21st century.  The ship, which is still being searched by Panamanian officials, contained 240 tons of Russian-made defensive weapons including two anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles in parts and spares and two MiG-21 jets, according to Cuban officials. Panama hasn't yet detailed what has been seized.  LATEST: Panama finds arms on N. Korean ship  Cuba says the weapons, which were en route to North Korea for repairs, are "obsolete." And experts who identified early Cold War relics like the Soviet-designed SA-2 air defense system among the ship's cargo say that's not far from the truth.  "We are talking about really old stuffthat technology was designed in the 1940s and 50s," said James O'Halloran, editor of Jane's Land Based Air Defence and Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems. "Very few countries still employ the SA-2 system as a frontline defensive weapon."  The SA-2, which consists of a single radar-guided missile mounted on a launcher, was developed years before the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1960 and was used by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, long before the advent of heat-seeking or satellite-guided missiles. Men sitting in radar trucks on the ground had to guide the rockets toward their targets.  O'Halloran says the tactic, if you were an American pilot in Vietnam, was to "watch this damn great thing coming toward you and at the last minute pull a heavy right or left, and the missile couldn't follow you, it just kept going."  "Today there is no reason for any Western pilot to be hit by an SA-2if you get caught by one of them, you've done something bloody stupid, or you've got very bad luck. No modern country wants to be seen with those."  But North Korea and Cuba, isolated communist allies and trading partners since the Cold War, aren't modern countries, to say the leastand after years of sanctions and embargoes there are few places (and even less cash) at their disposal to obtain new weapons, according to experts.  U.N.: North Korea continues banned weapons trade  "If you buy a new weapons system, you also have to buy the hardware and the training, which can take a year or more if you buy some of the more modern air defense systems that the Russians sell," said Mike Elleman, Senior Fellow for Regional Security Cooperation at IISS. "And the Cubans don't have the money."  Even if Cuba had the money, countries like Russia would be reluctant to sell the Castro regime advanced weapons systems for fear of infuriating the Americans. And even if Cuba obtained newer weapons, Elleman says the U.S. would still overwhelm them in short order.  What's left for countries like Cuba is to seek repairs on systems like the SA-2, which went out of commission decades ago, and the MiG-21 jet, which was last produced in 1985 and is now mostly kept by long-time Russian allies for spare parts, according to O'Halloran at Jane's.  As Panamanian authorities continue to search the Chong Chon Ganga freighter with its own checkered pastthey are asking the U.S. and United Kingdom to send teams to help them identify the weapons, and will invite a special commission from the United Nations to determine whether the shipment violates the organization's North Korea weapons ban.  In the meantime, experts don't expect the episode will have a lasting effect diplomatically on either countryNorth Korea is already "sanctioned to the hilt," says Ellemann, and Cuba's relations with the U.S. are thawing after decades of tension.  "There are a good number of people who believe that the sanctions against Cuba are very outdated and that it's just a matter of time before they're lifted, and I don't see this changing that," Ellemann told CNN.  The more lasting impression of the raid on ship could, in the end, be the 10,000 tons of brown sugar found on-board the ship. The crew attempted to sabotage the Chong Chon Gang by cutting the cables on its cargo cranes, meaning Panamanian authorities have had to remove the 255,000 bags of sugar by hand.  Experts believe the sugar could be Cuban payment to cash-strapped North Korea in exchange for the weapons repairs.  "This will be much ado about nothing, except telling the world just how bad a shape Cuba and North Korea are in todaybartering early Cold War materials for sugar, that speaks volumes," said Ellemann.

Washington Residents of the  LeDroit  Park, a low income area of Washington gathered at the neighborhood farm on Tuesday to meet with  British royalty. And, the Prince of Wales was happy to shake hands and talk  gardening.  Prince Charles arrived in the  U.S. Tuesday afternoon for a  three-day visit that includes stops at the Supreme Court, Georgetown University and the White  House.  The British Embassy says the visit will  highlight environmental sustainability and that's why he stopped by the Common  Good City Farm where they grow fruits and vegetables and supply it  to the low income residents of the community who can't afford healthy food.  With the tomato plants in the ground and  the potatoes already up, many of those residents turned out to see the Prince,  take pictures, and congratulate him on the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of  Cambridge.  His eldest son Prince William married  Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abby on Friday in what has been called the  largest celebration in London in decades.  Prince Charles talked irrigation with the  farmers, and received from a young girl a bouquet of flowers that were grown on  the farm.  Tomorrow, he will give the  keynote address at "The Future of Food" conference at Georgetown University on future sustainability of the  world's food system and the importance of resiliency of our ecosystem.  Earlier Tuesday, the prince attended a  reception at the Supreme Court for Marshall Scholar alumni. The program is  funded by the British government to introduce top U.S.  college students to British culture.  On Wednesday, Prince Charles will go to the  White House to meet with President Obama.  
 President Barack Obama has done the right thing by asking Congress to authorize the use of force against Syria to punish President Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons on his own people.  I say that even as someone who has been a sharp critic of the administration's Syria policy and an outspoken advocate of intervening in various ways to try to protect the millions of innocent Syrians whose lives are at risk, prevent the conflict from destabilizing the region and support members of the Syrian opposition who share our values.  The president, as he announced in May, is trying to steer this nation back to a world in which we are not permanently at war and we do not turn to our military as the weapon of first resort in any international crisis.  The Framers of our Constitution wanted to ensure that the decision to send our young men and women into battle could not be taken lightly. Both Democratic and Republican presidents have steadily chafed at those restraints over the course of the decades since World War II as traditional wars and formal declarations of war have faded away. George W. Bush's proclamation of a "war on terror," authorized by Congress, put this nation in a state of permanent emergency in which the commander in chief has had extraordinary powers.  Opinion: GOP shouldn't bail out Obama's floundering foreign policy  That is unhealthy and dangerous for a democracy. A former constitutional law professor, Obama understands that although he has a limited reserve of power that could allow him to act alone, his power will be far greater with Congress. The constitutional framework is designed be a check in the best senseto require our leaders to make their case to the American people, to act on the basis of reasoned arguments about the nature of American interests that will stand up far beyond the White House Situation Room.  And the American people should back him on this decision, for three reasons.  First, we are protecting ourselves and our allies. We cannot afford to live in a world in which nations can use chemical weapons with impunity. The taboo against chemical weapons is particularly strong, for good reason. Dying by the breath we need to live holds a particular terror. The parents of the children whose shrouds we see could not protect them even with their own bodies, like human shields from a bullet or a bomb.  The United States stood by when Iraq used chemical weapons first against Iran and later against its own people, to our shame. But we must not make that mistake again. Chemical weapons are the weapons of the weak against the strong, which is why al-Assad, has been driven to use them repeatedly, according to U.S. intelligence, when his back is against the wall, as it is now in Damascus. Should chemical weapons proliferate, they will be the weapons of choice for terrorists.  Opinion: Obama, ignore the polls on Syria  Second, striking Syria now will be a strike to protect the Syrian people, even if partial and belated. It will not end the massacres carried out with conventional weapons. But weapons of mass destruction are just that: weapons of mass destruction. A chemical attack that kills 1,000 today can kill 10,000 tomorrow and 100,000 the day after that.  Third, the president is asking us to do, as a nation, what a leader has to do. In his 2008 inaugural address, Obama called for a new era of responsibility in this country, "a recognition ... that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world." We have those duties not because the United States has some unique role or mission in the world, but because we are the world's most powerful nation. Other nations take their cues from our action or inaction, whether we want them to or not.  If we do not act, we are signaling that the world has suddenly become a far more permissive and dangerous place, that taboos can be broken, and that despite the pious words of the international community, leaders can do whatever they like within their own borders.  If we lead, other nations that take their responsibilities seriously as great powers will join us. A Russian veto may prevent the U.N. Security Council from authorizing our action in advance, but a majority of the members of the council will not vote to condemn the strikes after the fact.  It is now time for Congress to step up to its responsibility. The bargaining has already begun. But the use of force after the use of chemical weapons, with the world watching, is no place for partisan politics as usual.  Opinion: Obama's irony, McCain's agony  Unless a clear majority of Congress opposes any action, it is incumbent on all those members who favor some use of force to craft a compromise that gives Obama the power to use both force and diplomacy as president and commander in chief to restore the chemical taboo and do whatever he can to reach a political settlement in Syria.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anne-Marie Slaughter.

Nairobi, Kenya The villagers' faces light up as Evans Wadongo arrives. Men, women and children sing and gather around as he shows how his inventiona solar-powered LED lanternwill soon light up their homes.  "These families, they are so poor. They don't have electricity," said Wadongo, a native of rural Kenya. "It's only kerosene and firewood that they use for lighting, cooking.  "The amount of money that every household uses to buy kerosene every dayif they can just save that money, they can be able to buy food."  Wadongo, 23, not only is giving his country's rural families a way to replace the smoky kerosene and firelight with solar power, he says he also hopes his invention will ultimately improve education and reduce poverty and hunger. And he's providing it for free.  Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes  The youngest of four children, Wadongo grew up in a home that stressed the importance of educationhis father was a high school teacher. But years of exposure to smoke while studying by kerosene and firelight left Wadongo with eyesight problems.  With a lack of good light to study byWadongo often had to share one lantern with his siblings and other family membershe remembers the frustration of unfinished homework and poor exam performance.  "I couldn't compete effectively with other kids who had access to lighting," he said. "In every home in the village it was the same. Many children drop out of school for these reasons ... so they remain poor for the rest of their life. All along I was asking myself if there is anything that can be done to improve this situation."  In 2004, while attending a Kenyan university for agriculture and technology, Wadongo found his answer. He was fiddling with a dorm experiment involving the timing of LED (light-emitting diode) Christmas lights when it struck him: The environmentally friendly light source could be used to light rural homes.  "I knew it would have to be sourced by the sun to be useful to people in rural areas," he said, "but [I] had never seen a solar panel small enough for individual homes."  Then, while walking home from visiting a friend, Wadongo stumbled upon a broken-off piece of a discarded solar panel. With it, he was able to light a small number of LEDs. His projectUse Solar, Save Liveswas born.  "I immediately knew the impact that [it] would have on the rural communities," he said.  An artisan helped him design the solar lantern, which Wadongo calls MwangaBoraSwahili for "good light."  To help get the project started, Wadongo's family and friends subsidized his student loans for two years. Production of the lanterns was slow until Wadongo attended a leadership training program sponsored by the nonprofit Sustainable Development for All-Kenya.  When the group heard about his MwangaBora, it immediately committed to help, eventually bringing Wadongo on as a partner and chairman of the board.  The group has helped reduce production costs to $20 per lantern. Costs are covered by donations. Volunteers help build the lanterns and work with local government and women's groups to determine the communities most in need. The group sets a small percentage of the cost of each lamp to go toward the volunteers.  "We're helping them to earn a living. They're able now to sustain their families," he said.  Wadongo works on the lantern project full time without pay and eats only one meal a day to help save money and build more lanterns. He said he expects costs to decrease further as the program grows.  The group buys excess pieces of solar paneling, cut from commercially sold panels, in bulk from an overseas company. In an outdoor metal shop, Wadongo and volunteers hammer scrap metal for the frame of the lantern.  Wadongo estimates he's distributed 10,000 lanternsand he has no plans for slowing down.  "I want to reach out to as many rural communities as possible," he said. "The impact is saving lives."  Children can now study. Households can buy food with the money they save on kerosene, reducing hunger in communities. The solar lanterns help reduce carbon emissions, too. Wadongo said that when the time and need arises, he intends to service, replace and recycle his lanterns.  For villager Julia Dzame and her three children, life will change dramatically thanks to Wadongo and his solar lantern.  "I am so grateful for the lights," she said. "My children will have light to read, and I'll have my own light to cook in the kitchen. No more sickness brought [on] by smoke."  For Wadongo, the satisfaction comes in knowing that he's helping to lift people out of poverty.  "I just feel like it's right," he said.  Want to get involved?

 It's a fishing trip that could have had a very different ending.  Efstathios "Steve" Moumouris' wife had fitting words shortly after the Florida man was rescued from the Gulf of Mexico, where he had bobbed for nearly 24 hours.  "There are no words to describe it," Anastasia Moumouris told CNN Tampa affiliate WTSP. "I said if anybody could make it would be him."  The dehydrated Moumouris, 51, was spotted by good Samaritans who were out fishing for scallops off of Crystal River in Citrus County. He was about seven miles southwest of Crystal River.  "We got him on board and he was fairly coherent," said Todd Hoy.  The man had texted his wife Wednesday afternoon to tell her he was heading in, according to WTSP. He was not heard from again and she contacted authorities.  Moumouris' 16-food boat earlier Thursday was found unattended nine miles from the Fort Island boat ramp.  The Citrus County Sheriff's Office said a storm tossed Moumouris from his vessel. He was not wearing a life jacket when found.  The fisherman was expected to be released from a local hospital.

Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has launched a staunch defense of John Terry declaring: "He is not a racist."  Chelsea captain Terry was handed a four-match ban and a $356,000 fine by the English Football Association on Thursday after being found guilty of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand.  Terry, who captained Mourinho's Chelsea to consecutive Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006, remains close friends with the Portuguese manager, who is now Real Madrid's coach, following their successful time at Stamford Bridge.  Terry retires from England amid racism case  "He is not a racist," Mourinho told CNN in an exclusive interview.  "That's 100%. Chelsea had a squad where we had 12 African players in the squad. It was a fantastic squad and he had always a great relation with every one of them."  While defending Terry, Mourinho insisted the FA had been right to punish Terry.  "But in football it can happen, and I know it can happen, that during a football matchbecause sometimes it's more than a gamesometimes you have reactions that don't represent what you are really.  "Probably, he had a racist comment or a "racist" attitude against an opponent and, sometimes in football, we look to our opponents in the wrong way. But to pay, he has to be punished.  Racism remains "significant" problem in English football  "But please, don't say that he is a racist, because I know what I am saying. Didier Drogba will say, Geremi will say, Claude Makelele will say, all of them will say that he is not a racist."  The incident involving Terry is the second high-profile case of racist abuse on the football field following the incident between Liverpool's Luis Suarez and Manchester United's Patrice Evra last year.  The Liverpool striker was banned for eight matches and fined $65,000 after being found guilty of misconduct, regarding "using insulting words towards" Evra during the game at Anfield on October 15 2011.  And asked whether he though there is still racism in football, Mourinho replied: "I never felt it. Never. In a dressing room, I have never felt it and I've always had African players in every one of my teams."  Terry's punishment comes just days after he announced his retirement from international football, claiming that the FA had made his position within the national team 'untenable'.  In July the 31-year-old defender had been found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence at Westminster Magistrates' Court.  However the FA requires a lower burden of proof than an English court and it took the decision to bring Terry before its disciplinary system.  Terry found guilty in racism case  
 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan The Taliban in Pakistan have issued a direct challenge to the legitimacy of the Pakistani government, by declaring the country's entire legal system "un-Islamic."  Taliban representatives leave talks in Peshawar in February after reaching a deal on Sharia law in Swat.  "Let the judges and the lawyers go to Islamic university," said Muslim Khan, a Taliban spokesman in Pakistan's Swat Valley. "(After) they learn Islamic rules, Islamic regulation, they can continue to work."  In a telephone interview Tuesday with CNN, Khan demanded the imposition of Islamic sharia law all across the country. He also called for the creation of jaziya, an Islamic tax, to be levied on all non-Muslims in Pakistan. And Khan denounced any Pakistanis who disagreed with his interpretation of Islam, calling them "non-Muslims."  The Taliban militant echoed statements made by Sufi Muhammed, an Islamist fundamentalist leader who helped broker a peace deal between the Pakistani government and the Taliban in Swat Valley.  Last week, the deal led to the implementation of sharia law in Swat, an alpine region that was once one of Pakistan's most popular destinations for foreign tourists.  Speaking before an audience of tens of thousands on Sunday, Sufi Muhammed declared democracy and Pakistan's judicial system "un-Islamic."  Since reaching his peace deal with the government in Islamabad, Muhammed has been appointing qazis, or clerics, to serve as judges in Islamic courts in Swat.  The rise of the Taliban in Swat has alarmed and frightened some members of local civil society there.  "This is a time bomb for the country," said Aftab Alam, the head of the lawyers' association in Swat district.  Speaking by telephone from the town of Mingora, Alam claimed Taliban militants have kidnapped, ransomed and even killed lawyers in recent months.  "The only sane voice against the militants, the only sane voice against the criminals, is the lawyer community," he said. "And this is why we have been declared by them, I mean the militants, liable to death."  This week, some secular Pakistani political parties publicly condemned the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islam. But many other prominent officials appear unwilling or unable to challenge the creeping Taliban conversion of Pakistani society.  For example, Ali Ahmed Kurd, one of the leaders of the lawyers protest movement which helped bring down the government of military ruler Pervez Musharraf, declined to comment on Tuesday when asked by CNN about Sufi Mohammed's comments.  In recent months, videos have emerged showing what appear to be Taliban militants in Swat meting out vigilante justice.  One video shows men beating a woman accused of adultery with a cane. Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan initially claimed responsibility for the public caning in interviews with Pakistani TV stations. But in his interview with CNN on Tuesday he reversed his position, accusing "opponents of Islam" of making fake videos to hurt his movement's image.  Meanwhile, in another Taliban-run region called Orakzai, details emerged of militants forcing a small community of Sikhs to pay a jaziya or "minority tax" of 10.5 million rupees, roughly 18,000 dollars earlier this month.  During his interview, Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan said that if his vision of an Islamic society is fulfilled in Pakistan, terror mastermind Osama Bin Laden will be welcome to travel and live openly here. "Sure, he's a Muslim, he can go anywhere," Khan said.  Khan added that he would like to see sharia law implemented beyond Pakistan, even in America, a country he knows intimately. For four years, the Taliban spokesman lived in the United States, working as a painter near Boston.

Niamey, Niger An Islamist militant group has claimed responsibility for Thursday's deadly attacks on an army barracks and a uranium mine in Niger, saying they were responses to Niger's cooperation with France in a "war against Sharia," CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.  Twenty soldiers and five assailants were killed, and at least 30 other peopleincluding civilianswere injured in attacks about 200 kilometers (124 miles) apart in Niger early Thursday, the African nation's defense minister said.  Karidjo Mahamadou said later security forces were in charge of the two sites, including one where an attacker had taken hostages.  "I ensure that the situation is under control and that the Niger security forces have renewed the vow to secure the country and the people," he said.  A spokesman for the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, or MUJAO, said that "thanks to Allah, we have carried two operations against the enemies of Islam in Niger," BFMTV reported.  MUJAO is among the radical Islamist groups that have been fighting Malian and French forces in Mali, which borders Niger.  Both attacksat the army barracks in Agadez in central Niger and a Somair uranium mine in Arlit in northern Nigerhappened about 5 a.m., Niger Domestic Affairs Minister Abdou Labo said.  In Agadez, a regional capital to the southeast of Arlit, a truck carrying armed assailants and explosives detonated in front of the army barracks, Labo said.  A battle ensued in which the 20 soldiers were killed, Labo said. A breakdown of how many deaths were attributable to the bombing and how many happened in the battle wasn't available.  The surviving assailant closed himself in a building with cadets and threatened to detonate explosives, Labo said.  Mahamadou didn't say whether the suspect had been captured when he said everything was under control.  At the Somair mine, operated by French nuclear power group Areva, a truck with explosives blew up at the gates, killing two assailants, Labo said. At least 14 civilians were wounded, Mahamadou said.  Areva said the injured included at least 13 workers.  MUJAO spokesman Abu Walid Sahraoui said the group "attacked France and Niger for its cooperation with France in the war against Sharia," BFMTV reported Thursday.  France deployed about 4,000 troops to Mali, the country directly to Niger's west, in January to drive out Islamist militantsincluding MUJAO memberswho had attempted to take control of the country.  Islamic extremists with links to al Qaeda carved out a large portion of northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup in March 2012. France took military action this year after the militants began to push into the southern portion of the country.  MUJAO is a splinter group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, according to the United Nations.  France strongly condemned Thursday's attacks, the French foreign ministry said. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius spoke with his Nigerien counterpart and expressed France's solidarity with Nigerien authorities in the fight against terrorist groups, the ministry said.  Niger, a former colony of France, gained independence in 1960.  Journalist Ibbo Daddy Abdoulaye reported from Niamey, Niger. CNN's Jason Hanna and Pierre Meilhan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Amir Ahmed also contributed to this report.  
 A New York State Supreme Court justice dismissed Friday a defamation lawsuit against Syracuse University and its longtime head basketball coach, Jim Boeheim.  The suit was filed in December by two former ball boys for the basketball team, who have accused Bernie Fine, a former assistant coach, of repeated sexual abuse when they were children.  Boeheim initially supported Fine, a longtime friend and colleague, accusing Mike Lang and his stepbrother, Bobby Davis, of fabricating their accusations of Fine's alleged misconduct. The coach later apologized for his comments.  Justice Brian DeJoseph of the Onondaga County Supreme Court ruled Friday that the initial statements made to media outlets by Boeheim "were likely to be an opiniona biased, passionate, and defensive point of view of a basketball coachrather than objective fact. Thus, plaintiff's defamation claim against Boeheim fails as a matter of law."  Kevin Quinn, Syracuse's senior vice president for public affairs, said the university is "gratified" by the decision.  Gloria Allred, an attorney for Lang and Davis, vowed to appeal.  "It is difficult enough for victims of childhood sexual abuse to come forward. This decision sends the message that you can attack the alleged victim and call him a liar with impunity. It makes it even harder for victims to come forward," she said in a statement.  Fine was fired from Syracuse in November after the allegations surfaced. He has not been charged with a crime and has maintained his innocence.  CNN's Andy Rose contributed to this report.

Marvel's upcoming "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." is one of fall TV's most anticipated new shows. The cast and producers were on hand at Comic-Con to preview the series, which was created by "The Avengers" director Joss Whedon and will premiere on ABC on September 24.  Those who attended the panel were treated to far more than just a teaser; the entire premiere episode was screened for the hall of fans, who gave the episode a standing ovation during the credits.  The series follows Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee who seemingly died at the hands of villain Loki in the "Avengers" movie. However, it's revealed his death was faked, and he now heads the team that appears in this TV series.  "I didn't like being dead," Gregg said. "But I really loved my death. I never thought anything could top that. I'm a longtime Marvel fan, so I just can't believe this is happening to me. I got a call from Marvel saying, 'You really do have a big part in "The Avengers." It's what happens to you that brings them together.' It was so amazing what Joss did and wrote. It was the greatest thing I'd done, and I was really pleased and proud."  "S.H.I.E.L.D." (Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division) extends the world created in the recent Marvel films, including "The Avengers," "Iron Man," "Thor" and "Captain America." While Whedon wouldn't confirm whether those characters show up on the program, he didn't rule out the possibility either.  "We may see some people [from the films] and we may see some people from the Marvel universe who are not cinematic," Whedon said. "But the most important thing is that we get to see these people who are here every week. So probably (some of those characters will appear), but I can't say when because that would spoil it."  The show will introduce several new actors, and the producers see "S.H.I.E..L.D." as a true team effort. Agent Maria Hill (Colbie Smulders) is in the pilot episode, newcomer Brett Dalton plays Agent Grant Ward while Chloe Bennet plays a mysterious character named Skye whose true intentions come to light in the pilot.  "I have that feeling that I have not had for a long time where I have assembled this extraordinary ensemble of talented and soon-to-be very full of themselves people," Whedon said. "The endless possibilities we have between them and among them and in their pasts and in their futures and their interactions. There's stuff we've taken from the Marvel universe, stuff we're bringing to the Marvel universe. This is a show that has so much history and so much to make that I guess I'm just a little excited."  
 Los Angeles Michael Jackson's oldest son, Prince, takes another step into the public eye this week with his first commercial endorsement.  Prince Jackson, 14, revealed in an interview that while he can't sing or dance like his father, he wants to be a television and movie actor. He has previously said he wanted to be a director.  While some Jackson fans may object, saying Prince Jackson is too young to be involved in an endorsement, the lawyer for grandmother Katherine Jackson said steps are being taken to "make sure that going forward everything with the children is done by the book."  Prince isn't doing it for the money, but as a favor for his uncles, the four surviving original members of the Jackson 5 group that featured his father.  None of the marketing materials for the jackets includes Prince's name or image, but he did join Jackie, Marlon and Tito Jackson recently when they autographed 1,000 replicas of Michael Jackson's "Beat It" and "Thriller" leather jackets. Jermaine Jackson also signed the jackets, which go on sale Thursday through Amazon.com.  The J5 Collection, which is based on the styles of the Jackson 5, will introduce Michael Jackson's style "to a new generation," Prince Jackson told CNN.  He might wear them to "dress up parties," he said. "It's not casual, but it's nice to wear to events."  Prince Jackson, who's about 5-foot-10, is showing signs of a young man who is ready to make his own mark on the world.  Jackson's three childrenPrince, Paris and Blanketwere famously sheltered from public view until their father's death on June 25th, 2009. It wasn't until the pop icon's memorial service that the world got a close look at them.  Paris, now 13, spoke for her brothers then, saying her "daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine."  Prince Jackson spoke up on the Grammys stage in February 2010 when he accepted his father's lifetime achievement award.  "To all his songs, his message was simple, love," then-12-year-old Prince said. "We will continue to spread his message and help the world."  Since then, Prince talked briefly to Oprah Winfrey when she visited his home last year to interview grandparents Joe and Katherine Jackson.  Prince also walked a red carpet and answered a few questions from reporters during a recent trip to Germany to accept an award to his father.  He smiled broadly and appeared confident on stage at the tribute show to his father in Wales last month when he introduced Beyonce's song.  Prince said he's hoping to travel with Jackie, Tito and Marlon Jackson when they perform shows in Japan next month. The plan is to have Prince introduce his uncles on stage, Marlon Jackson said.  Perry Sanders, the lawyer for Katherine Jackson, said Prince has indicated he is determined to make his own money, even though he will inherit many millions from his father's estate.  Taking care to make the right decisions about what deals to accept and what to reject is crucial to protecting his brand as the eldest son of the King of Pop, he said.  His uncles asked Prince to support the "Thriller" and "Beat It" jacket sales, a line that is authorized by the executors of the Michael Jackson estate.  "These limited quantity collector's items are exact replicas of the iconic originals and were created by the original designer of the jackets," according to a news release.  Michael Jackson debuted the red "Beat It" and red and black "Thriller" jackets, designed by Marc Laurent, in 1983. The Jackson brothers signed 500 of each jacket, which will sell for $2,350.

 A Texas woman got a quadruple Valentine's Day gift this year, giving birth to four babiestwo sets of identical twins.  Ace, Blaine, Cash and Dylan Montalvo were born at the Woman's Hospital of Texas in Houston to Tressa Montalvo, 36, and her husband, Manuel, 43, of Houston.  Ace and Blaine were first, born at 8:51 a.m. and weighing 3 pounds, 10 ounces, and 3 pounds, 15 ounces, respectively, the hospital said. Cash and Dylan were a minute later and weighed 2 pounds, 15 ounces and 3 pounds, 6 ounces. All four were born by cesarean section.  "We tried to stick to the A-B-C-D theme when naming them," Tressa Montalvo said in a statement the hospital released.  The twins were not the result of fertility treatments, the hospital said. Tressa Montalvo learned she was carrying twins at 10 weeks.  A third heartbeat was found at a later doctor's visit, and the Montalvos were referred to a maternal fetal medicine specialist, Dr. Brian Kirshon.  "We couldn't have been more surprised when Dr. Kirshon told us we were having four babies and that they were two sets of twins," Manuel Montalvo said.  Each pair of twins shared a placenta, the hospital said.  Identical twins result when a fertilized egg splits into two embryos. Twins occur in about 2% of all pregnancies, according to the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Of those, 30% are identical twins.  The odds of having two sets of twins at once is about 1 in 70 million, said Dr. Alan Penzias, associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School.  The boys were all born at 31 weeks' gestation, so they face some health risks, as their immune systems aren't fully developed, said Krista Cato, a nurse in the pediatric intensive care unit of Children's National Medical Center in Washington.  Manuel Montalvo said he and his wife were trying to have "one little brother or sister" for their 2-year-old son, Memphis.  "We didn't expect it," Tressa Montalvo said. "We were trying for just one and we were blessed with four. ... We planned the pregnancyI guess we just succeeded a little too much."  Still, the Montalvos say, they are planning on trying again.

New York Protests swelled in cities nationwide Friday as police forces struggled to either corral or remove demonstrators from downtown parks and plazas in the latest development of the monthlong Occupy Wall Street movement.  Scores of protesters were arrested in Denver, Seattle, San Diego and New York, though reports of violence were rare. CNN iReporters sent in photos and video from "occupy" protests across several American cities.  In San Diego, CNN affiliate KFMB broadcast images of police detaining demonstrators as they gathered amid tents and tarps strewn about a downtown plaza.  Protesters appeared to refuse to leave the area, sitting in columns atop the plastic tarps and yelling "stay down" as police tried to remove them from the scene. At one point, police used pepper spray to break up the crowd.  "We understand people have a right to protest (but), somewhere along the line, people have a right to conduct business," San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne told CNN affiliate KGTV.  Police eventually removed tents that had been set up by protestors and cleared the area by late afternoon.  In Denver, authorities said 24 people were arrested as CNN affiliate KMGH broadcast aerial video of police detaining protesters in a downtown section of the city.  Colorado State Police spokesman Mike Baker said the demonstrators could be identified as two distinct groups: The first was a part of what he described as the local "Occupy" group, which maintained close communication with law enforcement during the demonstration. The second, he said, was a more "radical" faction.  "These were the ones (police) came into trouble with today," Baker said.  Most of those arrested in Denver were charged with unlawful conduct on state property, he said, while one other person was charged with simple assault. Another protester was arrested for impeding traffic.  In Seattle, police in riot gear rounded up and arrested 41 demonstrators who gathered in a city park, said police spokeswoman Renee Witt.  In New York , Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said law officers arrested 14 demonstrators after they sat in roadways to block traffic, overturned trash bins, knocked over a police scooter and hurled bottles.  Wesleyan University student Ben Doernberg, who attended Friday's protest in Manhattan's financial district, shot video of at least one demonstrator being taken to the ground by police.  The video captures a police officer pressing his night stick against the back of the protester's neck during the arrest. The man is seen face down on the pavement.  He can be heard screaming after what Doernberg described as an earlier incident in which the man's leg was allegedly run over by a police motorcycle.  "I saw a number of other people being shoved or pushed with batons," Doernberg said. "I saw another officer punching people."  New York police disputed the claim that the man had been run over by a police vehicle. Independent witnesses from the New York Daily News and The Associated Press saw the man intentionally place his legs under the scooter, Browne said in a statement.  "(The man) had repeatedly disregarded lawful orders to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk, and then feigned being run over before kicking over the police scooter. He was arrested for felony criminal mischief, obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest," the deputy police commissioner said.  The demonstrations, meanwhile, seemed to pick up steam across the country by late Friday afternoon.  CNN affiliate WDIV in Detroit showed aerial images of protesters rallying in city streets. An oversize sign fixed to the outside of a building read, "Outsource to Detroit."  Hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons called the protests "inspirational."  "People want this country to be better," he told CNN. "They want the money out of Washington." He said he believes the U.S. government remains largely controlled by corporations.  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also addressed the concerns again earlier Friday during his weekly radio show.  He said Brookfield Office Propertiesthe real estate firm that owns Zuccotti Park, considered a home base for Manhattan protestersmade the decision not to try to clean up the park, as it had announced, after the company was "inundated" with threatening calls from elected city officials.  The mayor said on New York's WOR Radio that he didn't know which officials allegedly made the threats, but the company decided to work out some form of a negotiated settlement in the coming days.  Bloomberg added that while he lacked firsthand knowledge of the conversations, he was told the officials generally threatened to "make life more difficult" for the real estate company.  Brookfield Properties issued a statement later Friday saying "a number of local political leaders" requested the cleaning of the park be deferred for "a short period of time." But the company declined to provide specifics on which city officials had made the calls or whether they were considered threatening.  The clean-up cancellation, meanwhile, averted a broader showdown between authorities and demonstrators, who appeared heartened by news.  "We are winning and Wall Street is afraid," protester Kira Moyer-Sims said in a written statement distributed by the group. "This movement is gaining momentum and is too big to fail."  Bloomberg's office also said the real estate firm withdrew its request for police assistance Friday.  "Our position has been consistent throughout: the city's role is to protect public health and safety, to enforce the law, and guarantee the rights of all New Yorkers," said Deputy Mayor Cas Holloway.  City officials in New York had initially told the protesters, who have been mostly peaceful, that they would have to be ready to move out of the way of cleaners beginning at 7 a.m.  But the demonstrators mopped, collected trash and scrubbed the pavement in the dead of the night as the Friday deadline neared. When the word of the postponed cleaning filtered through the more than 1,000 protesters who filled the park, they appeared jubilant.  "All day! All week! Occupy Wall Street," the group chanted, calling the development a victory of passive resistance.  "We're extremely excited. This is an example of what people power can do," said Tyler Combelic, a spokesman for the group. "This is what democracy is all about in this country,"  Protesters descended on Zuccotti Park, near the New York Stock Exchange, on September 17 to protest the nation's ailing economy.  A number of unions, including the United Auto Workers and the United Federation of Teachers, have since pledged to support the New York protest and similar demonstrations cropping up across the country.  "You want to clean up something? Clean up these crooks on Wall Street," shouted City Council member Charles Barron.  Brooklyn Councilwoman Letitia James said the move to clean the park was a "ruse" to end the protest.  But Bloomberg said Wednesday that the decision to clean the park was made after the owners voiced concerns about "unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear on the park."  "The mayor is a strong believer in the First Amendment and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest," his office said in a written statement. But the situation in the park is "not in the best interests of the protesters, residents or the city," it added.  Share your photos, video from the protests, but stay safe  Local business owners and residents have continued to express concerns about sanitation and the group's affect on the local economy.  The plan had been to clean the park in stages, with protesters being allowed to return to the park as areas were cleaned, but only if they obeyed the rules set forth by Brookfield Properties, the company said.  Authorities had distributed a pamphlet at the park outlining the rules, which included a ban on camping or pitching tents; lying on the ground or on benches; placing tarps or sleeping bags on the ground; and storing personal property that interferes with park use.  The protest campaign began in July with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange.

 No cyanide remained in the exhumed body of Illinois lottery winner Urooj Khan, preventing investigators from determining how the toxin entered his body, the Cook County medical examiner said Friday.  Still, Dr. Stephen Cina maintained his determination from January: that blood samples taken after Khan's death in July show the 46-year-old died of cyanide poisoning and that the manner of death was homicide.  Officials in January exhumed the body of Khanwho died the day after the Illinois lottery issued him a check for about $425,000 for winning a scratch-off gamehoping to determine how cyanide entered his system.  "Cyanide has a short half-life, and it may be lost over the postmortem interval unless the tissues are adequately preserved," Cina said Friday. "In this case, due to advanced putrefaction of the tissue, no cyanide was detected" after the exhumation.  Investigators initially ruled Khan's manner of death natural. But after being prompted by a relative, technicians retested Khan's blood, leading to Cina's cause of death determination in January, more than a week before the body was exhumed.  Cina also said Friday that coronary artery disease was a contributing cause to Khan's death, because the autopsy showed one of his major coronary arteries was 75% blocked.  "Since cyanide affects oxygen utilization in the tissues, it follows logically that a natural disease process that already limits blood flow to the heart could render an individual particularly susceptible to death due to this toxin," he said.  Before the exhumation, Cina said that cyanide can evaporate from a body after death and that it was possible it would not still be present.  The autopsy results have been turned over to Chicago police, who have been investigating the case as a murder.  CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.

A North Dakota judge Wednesday halted the imminent implementation of a law that threatened to shut down the state's only abortion clinic by mandating that physicians involved in the practice have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.  The preliminary injunction blocks the law, SB 2305, from going into effect as scheduled on Thursday.  "This is not meant to denigrate the deep and profound convictions of those who oppose abortion, but nothing can be gained by fueling the passions that drive this 'intensely divisive controversy,'" Judge Wickham Corwin said in his ruling.  The ruling makes SB 2305 the latest North Dakota law on abortion that a court has blocked in recent weeks.  A federal judge earlier this month temporarily blocked the enforcement of a law banning abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.  The legislation affected by Wednesday's ruling required "all physicians performing abortion procedures (to) have admitting privileges at a hospital located within 30 miles of the abortion facility, and staff privileges to replace hospital on-staff physicians at that hospital."  "These privileges must include the abortion procedures the physician will be performing at abortion facilities," the law adds.  As Corwin points out, putting the law into effect would force the closure of Red River Women's Clinica place where "all abortions ... are completed long before the fetus becomes viable (and) are extremely safe and effective."  Its staff, until now, had no reason to be affiliated with a local hospital, much less be approved to perform abortions at such facilities. The judge noted that a Catholic hospital and a veteran's hospitalneither of which perform abortionsare within the 30-mile radius, as is one other hospital that requires doctors with admitting privileges to "generate the specified minimum volume of business."  Early stage abortions "are relatively simple procedures, performed on an outpatient basis" in clinics without need for hospitalization, he added. The "old argument" that the women need to be near hospitals should "grave complications" arise has been "dispelled," according to Corwin.  "It is hard to envision how a compelling need for state regulation could ever exist," the judge said. "In any event, the existing record clearly fails to suggest any need for the requirements imposed in SB 2305."  Tammi Kromenaker, the director of the Red River Women's Clinic, expressed satisfaction with Corwin's ruling and the fact that it means North Dakotans "will continue to have the same rights as women across the United States."  "The judge clearly stated that these attempts to contrive safety concerns continue to be wrong-headed, and that the (North Dakota) constitution does include protections for women seeking abortions," Kromenaker said.

 One of the strangest sequel projects in movie history is no longer a sequel.  In a joint statement, MGM Studios and Dahlia Waingort, the producer of the film originally known as Raging Bull II, declared on Wednesday that Waingort's film now has the working title The Bronx Bull, and is in no way associated with Martin Scorsese's 1980 film Raging Bull.  The announcement resolves a lawsuit brought by MGM in July that attempted to shut down production on the film, which traces the life of boxer Jake LaMotta in the years that span before and after Raging Bull. LaMotta, now 91 years old, has been cooperating with that project, but it otherwise had nothing to do with Scorsese's film, which won star Robert De Niro an Academy Award. Instead, Boardwalk Empire's William Forsythe is playing the older LaMotta, with Mojean Aria playing him as a youth.  Check out the full statement below:  The parties have amicably reached a resolution of their pending litigation, pursuant to which production of a film based upon certain events in the life of Jake LaMotta will proceed under the working title The Bronx Bull. That film is not related in any way to the 1980 motion picture entitled Raging Bull, and MGM is not associated with the film in any respect. Neither party will have any further statements regarding this matter.   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc and Dahlia Waingort, Producer, Sunset Pictures  See full story at EW.com.

TEHRAN, Iran  Iran's supreme leader is warning the thousands of people who have been protesting last week's presidential vote to maintain self-restraint or face a stiff reaction from authorities.  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks to a crowd in Tehran during Friday prayers.  Members of the oppositionwho have staged noisy demonstrations for the last six days to protest what they believe was a rigged electionare weighing their options after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei drew a line in the sand during his all-important sermon during Friday prayers.  The supreme leader declared last week's presidential election a "definitive victory" for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and sloughed off charges of vote tampering.  "Any extremist move will fan up another extremist move," said Khamenei, who criticized the street protests and said those who caused violence during demonstrations would be held accountable.  "If the political elite want to ignore law and break the law and take wrong measures which are harmful willy nilly, they will be held accountable for all the violence and blood and rioting."  Khamenei called on those who don't believe the results to use proper legal avenues, such as requesting a recount they could observe.  Watch Khamenei deny allegations of vote-rigging   He did not, however, issue a call for a new votea move that opposition leaders such as Mir Hossein Moussavi have been demanding.  Instead, he passionately defended the election as he addressed a crowd at Tehran University.  The election is expected to be a topic of conversation on Saturday before the Guardian Council, which supervises the country's elections. A council official said the body has invited three candidatesMoussavi, Mehdi Barrubi, and Mohsen Rezaieto its meeting to discuss any issues they see fit, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.  Watch Khamenei defend the outcome of the election   More protest rallies are planned for Saturdayone sponsored by supporters of opposition candidates Moussavi and Karrubi and another by supporters of former President Mohammed Khatami. While both camps said they had no plans to cancel the marches, the Interior Ministry told FARS news agency there were no permits issued for either event.  Analysts and observers are now debating what will happen next as more developments emerged on Friday.  "We do not yet know whether Ahmadinejad will stay, whether Mousavi will somehow be given a second chance, and if the ongoing political struggle will affect the security of the Supreme Leader," Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic & International Studies wrote in a paper published Friday after the speech.  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour describe what she saw while reporting on Iran election   He said that it's clear Khamenei is backing Ahmadinejad and any review of the election will be under those loyal to the supreme leader. But at the same time, Khamenei "cannot put this genie back in the bottle."  "Whatever happens, if Ahmadinejad stays without a truly legitimate election, the result will fester, not go away. Every embarrassing new piece of excessive rhetoric, every new threat to Iran's neighbors, every new problem in the economy, and every new act of social repression will be a reminder of the fact that Iran's leadership has questionable legitimacy at best," Cordesman wrote.  Human rights monitor Amnesty International issued a statement on Friday saying Khamenei's sermon "indicates the authorities' readiness to launch violent crackdowns if people continue to protest which may cause a widespread loss of life."  "We are extremely disturbed at statements made by Ayatollah Khamenei which seem to give the green light to security forces to violently handle protesters exercising their right to demonstrate and express their views," said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty's deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa program.  "If large numbers of people take to the street in protests in the next couple of days, we fear that they will face arbitrary arrest and excessive use of force, as has happened in recent days."  The group said Khamenei should have warned security to act with restraint.  "For a head of state to put the onus of security on peaceful demonstrators and not on the security forces is a gross dereliction of duty and a license for abuse," Sahraoui said on Friday.  Ahmadinejad got more than 24 million votes, defeating Moussavi, his main challenger, Khamenei said. He called the result plausible.  "Eleven million votes difference? Sometimes there's a margin of 100,000, 200,000, or 1 million maximum. Then one can doubt maybe there has been some rigging or manipulation or irregularities. But there's a difference of 11 million votes. How can vote rigging happen?" he asked.  He lauded the election as a "political earthquake."  "It was a great manifestation of people's participation in the affairs of their country. It depicted very well people's solidarity with their establishment," he said.  Khamenei praised the 85 percent voter turnout of about 40 million people, but said that some critics "wanted to indicate that as a doubtful victory; some even wanted to show that this is a national defeat. They wanted to give you bad taste in the mouth."  He also criticized what he said was a media narrative that the election pitted people who support the government against those who don't. He said all four candidates support the Islamic revolution.  "Enemies try through various media, and some of those media belong to the Zionists, ill-wishers. They try to make believe in those media that there is a fight between supporters of the Islamic establishment and the opposition. No, that's not true," he said.  Watch CNN's Kara Finnstrom on how information is coming out of Iran   At various junctures through the talk, the crowd chanted "Allah is Great," "Death to Israel," "Death to America," and "Death to Britain."  The supreme leader took on the United States, Britain, and Israel and apparently people in Iran, accusing them of manipulating and undermining the process. The comments prompted Britain's Foreign Office to summon Iran's ambassador to Britain.  Watch how world has reacted to the election   The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday overwhelmingly approved a resolution that supports "all Iranians who embrace the values of freedom, human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law." A similar measure was being prepared in the Senate.  And President Obama, in an interview with CBS News, said he was "very concernedbased on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been madethat the government of Iran recognize that the world is watching.  "And how they approach and deal with people who are, through peaceful means, trying to be heard will, I think, send a pretty clear signal to the international community about what Iran is and is not," Obama said.  Since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, sermons during Friday prayers have been delivered by prominent officials, including by the supreme leader on usually important occasions.  This appearance comes at what observers call a critical juncture in Iranian history, and since last Friday, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken  to the streets of Iran's capital to protest the election results.  When Iranian TV airs Friday prayers, the camera regularly focuses on important officials. In this case, the event was noteworthy for who was and who was not there. iReport.com: Share images from Iran  Ahmadinejad and Rezaie were there, but Karrubi and Moussaviwho called for a boycott of the prayerswere not seen.  Parliament speaker Ali Larijani, who has had a tense relationship in the past with Ahmadinejad, was sitting next to the president.  But former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has been in a power struggle with Khamenei, wasn't shown on the TV broadcast. Rafsanjani is chairman of the Assembly of Expertswhich is responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader and monitoring that body's attitudes toward Khamenei.  Khamenei remained staunch in his defense of Ahmadinejad, saying his views were closer to the president's than to those of Hashemi Rafsanjani, a supporter of Moussavi.  The supreme leader at the same time defended Rafsanjani from charges of corruption made by the president during the presidential debate. However, he opened the door to corruption charges against Rafsanjani's relatives.  Khatami, a supporter of Moussavi, wasn't seen as well.  In discussing Iran's support of human rights, Khamenei slammed U.S. policies in Afghanistan and Iraq .  There have been arrests and casualties since the election, with Amnesty International saying reports suggest up to 15 people have died. The government maintains the death toll is seven. An activist told CNN that the death toll has climbed to 32 across the nation, with 12 of those victims in Tehran.  Iranian TV Thursday night aired confessions from people who authorities say were paid to destabilize Iran. TV aired remarks from some "terrorists" who said the United States paid them to come from Iraq to Iran for the purposes of committing terrorist acts against the Iranian leadership.

 On Friday, a military jury decided U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales will get life in prison without parole for killing 16 Afghan villagers.  Yet victims left behindsome bearing physical scars, others with emotional ones from seeing their kin indiscriminately, brutally gunned downsay that, with that sentence, they don't feel they got justice.  Friday's decision was not entirely unexpected. In June Bales' pleaded guilty to more than 30 criminal charges, including 16 premeditated murder counts, spared himself from the prospect of a death sentence. He also pleaded guilty to charges related to illicit steroid and alcohol use.  But it still remained up to a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel to decide whether Bales should be eligible for parole.  They decided Friday he is not, according to Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield with Joint Base Lewis-McChord. That means the 39-year-old will spend the rest of his life in a military prison.  That's not punishment enough for Haji Wazir. Now 40, Wazir was inside his home in the Panjwai district of Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province in the pre-dawn hours of March 11, 2012, when Bales barged in.  What followed was a nightmare, ending with bloodied, limp and in some instances scorched bodies.  "We wanted this murderer to be executed, but we didn't get our wish," Wazir said through an interpreter Friday from the Washington state U.S. Army base where the sentence was handed down.  The sentence was not just, he added, before appealing to the U.S public to put themselves in his shoes.  "I'm asking the average American right here: If somebody jumps into your house in the middle of the night and kills 11 members of your family and tries to burn them, what punishment would you be passing on that person?"  Wazir and his family weren't the only ones torn on that horrific morning some 18 months ago.  Bales slipped away from Camp Belambay, the remote outpost where he was stationed, and into one village, where he began shooting at civilians. After that, he returned to the base, reloaded and went out again to target another village.  He left a trail of blood and gore in both villages, with nine children among the dead. Witnesses claimed that the U.S. soldier dragged some bodies of his victims' outside and set them ablaze.  The horror ended when Bales returned, once again, to Camp Belambay and turned himself in.  In the subsequent hours and days, some spoke highly about Bales, such as attorney Emma Scanlan who described him as a "devoted husband, father and dedicated member of the armed service."  Yet in Afghanistan and around the world, the massacre quickly spurred outrage.  The Taliban vowed to retaliate "by killing and beheading Americans anywhere in the country." Afghan President Hamid Karzai suggested, after meeting with villagers who'd seen the carnage and wanted Bales to be tried there to "heal our broken hearts," that the incident had put U.S.-Afghan relations at a breaking point.  "It is by all means the end of the rope here," Karzai said then. "The end of the rope that nobody can afford such luxuries anymore."  Bales was identified as the culprit days later and eventually put in solitary confinement at the U.S. military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  The military announced last December that Bales faced a court-martial.  The Army soldier spoke at this week's sentencing, calling what he'd done "an act of cowardice."  "I hid behind a mask of Bravado," Bales said, according to a tweet from court from Drew Mikkelsen of CNN Seattle affiliate KING. Also admitting he'd taken steroids and drank sporadically, the soldier apologized to his victims.  "I am responsible," he said.  Because of him, some in Afghanistan are still suffering the consequences.  Haji Mohammad Naim saw Bales come into his southwest Afghanistan home around 2 a.m. and kill women there, as well as some of his children. Bullets struck him in the neck and the face.  That incident and others in which U.S. soldiers have killed civiliansincluding another of Naim's sons, in a separate incident, he sayshave disgraced American forces in the eyes of many Afghans. Children in his village used to run toward U.S. troops, Naim said; now, they "run away and try to hide."  If America is to improve its image, there must be accountability, he said. And if Washington wants to help rebuild Afghanistan, "try to send the right people, not maniacs and psychos like (Bales)."  Still, even if the U.S. governments acts differently, some pain and suffering can't be undone.  Recalling tears shed by Bales' mother during the legal proceedings, Naim said, "But at least she can go and visit him.  "What about us?" he asked rhetorically. "Our family members are actually 6 feet under, and there's no way that we can visit them at all.  "They're gone."

Trayvon Martin's father says his heart is broken but his faith is not.  "God blessed Me & Sybrina with Tray and even in his death I know my baby proud of the FIGHT we along with all of you put up for him GOD BLESS," Tracy Martin wrote, in the first of three tweets sent about 30 minutes after the not-guilty decision was read in the Sanford, Florida, courtroom. By midnight, it had been retweeted more than 20,000 times.  Neither Tracy Martin nor Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother, was in the courtroom Saturday night when a six-woman jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the death of their son, Trayvon.  An attorney for the family said he told family members it would be better if they went home so they could attend church in the morning. Attorney Darryl Parks didn't say where Martin and Fulton were spending the night but called it a "safe location."  In his tweets, Martin thanked the family's supporters and the people who will join them to "make sure that this doesn't happen again."  Martin closed by saying: "Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY."  Later, Fulton sent out a message that offered thanks to God, whom she said she leans on for support.  "Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you," she said. "You are all that I have. At the end of the day, GOD is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I will love you forever Trayvon!!! In the name of Jesus!!!"  Tracy Martin and Fulton were in the courtroom for most of the trial, leaving briefly when photos of their dead son were shown one time to the jury. Each of them testified during the two-week trial. They both said they believed it was their son's voice crying for help on the recording of a 911 call made the night in February 2012 when Trayvon Martin was shot and killed.  But two police investigators told the jury that Tracy Martin had said 'no' when they asked him the same question.  The 911 call was played several times, ending with the gunshot that killed Trayvon Martin. The emotional toll of that, of testifying and sitting through all the testimony and the jury selection process was difficult for the family to endure, Parks said.  Zimmerman could still be held responsible for Martin's death  Benjamin Crump, the family's lead attorney, said Trayvon Martin would have been proud of his parents.  "Your tireless work in the name of your son has made Sanford and many other cities just a little safer for all our children," he said. "I know Trayvon is up there, proud at the changes that you as his parents have inspired in his name."  When asked what he has to say to Trayvon Martin's parents, Zimmerman's brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. said, "I think it would be remiss of me not to say, I understand tonight, I understand their pain. And there are no winners. They will not win or lose anything more than they already have lost, which is their son's life, by any kind of verdict for George.  "I applaud them for asking for the verdict to be respected. ... And I will pray for them."  Analysis: The race factor  CNN's Allison Gilbert contributed to this story.  
 Hong Kong Occupy Central in Hong Kong, one of the last outposts of the global protests sparked by the Occupy Wall Street movement, has been ordered to clear its encampment outside one of the world's largest banks.  For ten months, protestors have gathered at HSBC's headquarters in the heart of Hong Kong's financial district to air their grievances against corporate greed and social inequality  But on Monday, a Hong Kong court ruled in favor of HSBC's request to remove protesters camped by the entrance of its Asia-Pacific headquarters.  Although the bank is required by law to provide a passageway for pedestrians at its headquarters, the court ruled that protesters have no legal right to stake their ground.  "We welcome the decision of the court," HSBC spokesperson Gareth Hewett wrote in an email, adding that protesters will have two weeks to clear out before the bank intervenes.  While the number of active protestors has dwindled, more than a dozen tents remain at the site.  Ho Yiu Sing, one of three defendants who appeared in court on Monday, has camped under the bank since November.  The former financial analyst said he was treated unfairly in court and was disappointed by the verdict. He plans to leave the encampment, but hopes to find an alternate place to protest.  "Nowadays, most Hong Kong people aren't happy," Ho said. "The workers work for their whole lives for Hong Kong but they don't have money to buy food."  Chin Tang, an active Occupy Central member who works as a freelance graphic designer, said the protest sends a crucial anti-capitalist message to a city that is fueled by finance.  "We plan on coming back if they decide to evict us by force but we're not going to leave voluntarily," she added.  The order to evict Occupy protestors in Hong Kong comes a week after police cleared Occupy Frankfurt's encampment outside the European Central Bank's headquarters.  Most Occupy encampments in major cities have not enjoyed such longevity. Protestors at Occupy Wall Streetwhere the first Occupy protest took placewere evicted by police from their Zuccotti Park grounds two months in. London's iconic protest at Finsbury Square was removed by the local council after eight months.  The Occupy movement, which grew to encompass 900 cities, stemmed from a call for an "occupation" of New York City's financial center, published in Adbusters, an anti-consumerism magazine based in Vancouver, Canada. The grassroots movement has attracted a disparate group of protesters, bound by grievances toward socioeconomic inequality.

(Mashable)Apple developers, start your engines. Mac users, start dreaming of how much cooler your desktop or laptop experience could be this summer. That's when Apple will launch the latest big cat-themed Mac OS X, version 10.8: Mountain Lion.  At 8:30 a.m. EST Thursday, the developer preview version of Mountain Lion became available to Apple's legions of app makers. Mashable was briefed on the new Mac OS prior to the announcement.  Bottom line? It's a few more vital steps closer to fully connecting the experience you have on the Mac with the world of the iPad and the iPhonedumping iChat in favor of iMessage and Twitter, to take the most radical example. It's almost as if it makes your Mac moonlight as an iPad.  But it is categorically not the one OS to rule them all, if such a thing is even on Apple's radar.  OS 10.7, or Lion, launched in July 2011; 30 percent of Mac users now have it installed. (Another 50 percent of us still favor Snow Leopard). Coming in the wake of the iPad, it was clearly influenced by the success of the device. It introduced such iOS-like features as multitouch gestures on the trackpad and a "launchpad" of apps that looked just like the iPad's home screen.  Some of us began to wonder, with some cause, whether Mac OS X and the iOS were heading for a marriage down the road.  The iOS Moves In  Well, here's the next phase in the relationship, and iOS has practically moved in to Mac's house. If Lion was a toothbrush in the bathroom, Mountain Lion is a chest of drawers in the bedroom. Reminders, iMessage, Game Center, Notifications, iCloud and Twitter integration  all iOS's most intimate stuff is here, and it all pretty much looks the same as it does on the iPad. Most of it is designed to sync up so it is exactly the same.  SEE ALSO: Apple Mountain Lion Embraces Flickr and Vimeo Sharing  And Mac OS X has had to throw out some of its stuff. Bouncing icons in the dock? Who needs them when you've got Notifications, which appear in classy banners down the side of the screen? The venerable antique Instant Message software, iChat, a 2002 vintage? A stupid wagon-wheel coffee table, says iOS. Throw it out.  Instead, here's iMessage, which will still let you IM your contacts (if you must). But what it really wants you to do is use Apple's seamless texting replacement of the same name. Admittedly, the thought of being able to immediately text anyone with an iPhone for free from your desktop is so unbelievably cool, it can bring on an attack of the vapors.  You get the sense the Mac is going to be happy with its new roommate. What's not to like about Airplay, which can seamlessly mirror your desktop on an HDTV? Or a separate Notes app, where you can attach notes to the desktop like stickies? Or Game Center, which will mean a lot more cross-device play?  Or a "share sheet," which effectively means developers are going to be able to put Twitter buttons everywhere? Mountain Lion will already let you tweet from all standard OS X apps such as Safari and Photo Booth. That means you can sit and take photos of yourself and instantly tweet them, to your heart's content. It's a boon for Twitter users (Twitter readers, not so much).  So things are going to be a lot more fun around the edges of the Mac OSwhich is no bad thing. At the grand old age of 12, OS X was starting to seem a little too same-y with each iteration. This new younger partner is about to give the Mac a new lease on life. (How much that will cost, we don't know; Apple isn't announcing a price yet, or a launch date more precise than "late summer.")  But don't expect iOS to go hog-wild and bring its apps on board in future versions. Apple is giving a hefty push to the Mac app store, which benefits from a security feature called Gatekeeper where you can limit installations to just Mac store apps. (You might want to do this for your malware prone-parents, say.)  Developers are going to have to make two separate versions of apps they want on Mac and iOS for some time to come, and that's just fine with Apple. When it comes to its two operating systems, the company seems to believe living together is good enough.  So what do you think? Will you buy it? Take a quick gander at a video we put together with material from Apple, then a gallery of screenshotsand last but not least, your chance to chat up a storm about this major Mac development in the comments.   2011 MASHABLE.com.

 New York Amtrak Northeast Corridor service between New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, continued to be affected by ongoing signal problems Wednesday in New Jersey, Amtrak said in a 10 a.m. statement. In addition, while New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor service improved as the morning progressed, the line was still suffering delays into the afternoon, the railroad's website said in a 12:24 p.m. update.  The outage was caused by a downed tree that fell into the overhead wire system near Hamilton, New Jersey, Amtrak said.  As a result, Amtrak trains were moving at greatly reduced speeds, with some trains canceled due to associated congestion.  Amtrak said its personnel were working to repair the problem, but passengers should expect westbound/southbound delays of 90 to 120 minutes and 60 to 90 minute eastbound/northbound delays.  No trains were stranded between stations, and passengers were being re-accommodated on other trains where available, Amtrak said.  Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole couldn't say how long trains would be traveling with reduced speed and frequency before service would be completely restored.  New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor service between New Brunswick, New Jersey, and New York was back on schedule or close to on schedule in both directions, according to the transit website.  However, 30- to 45-minute delays plagued the Northeast Corridor line into the afternoon because of signal problems, the website said.  Service was suspended most of the morning in both directions between Trenton, New Jersey, and New Brunswick, because of the signal problems. Passengers were advised to get on the 11:17 a.m. train departing from Trenton.  Transit and suburban buses were accepting rail tickets and passes for fares Wednesday morning, the website said.

Stop me if you've heard this one before.  A TV series based on a comic book series premieres Friday.  There have been a lot of them lately, from "Gotham" to "The Flash" (and of course the ratings juggernaut "The Walking Dead"). They've done quite well this season: Both "Gotham" and "Flash" received full-season pickups.  NBC's new offering, "Constantine," is a riskier proposition. It's based on the story of cult character John Constantine, the chain-smoking exorcist antihero from the "Hellblazer" comic books. Keanu Reeves played him in a 2005 film version, which got a lukewarm reception.  Even so, the show seems well-suited to NBC's Friday night horror lineup, following the sleeper hit "Grimm."  CNN visited the Atlanta set of "Constantine" and spoke with Constantine himself, Matt Ryan, as well as his co-star Charlie Halford (who plays one of John's sidekicks, Chas), and later spoke to executive producer Daniel Cerone.  The set itself included a cobweb-filled library that serves as John's base of operations. Watching a contortionist portray a demon-possessed woman seemed to be just another day at the office here.  In between scenes, we asked their thoughts on whether the show had what it takes to be another comics-based hit.  CNN: Do you think the hardcore fans will enjoy this series?  Matt Ryan: I think the fans will get a lot out of this series. I hope they will. The source material is so amazing. We're really trying to stay true to that. We're transposing it to this medium of television. We're staying true to this character in the comics. The fans will hopefully come with us, and new fans will like the show as will.  Daniel Cerone: The fans are very important to us. I'm fortunate enough to have as my partner David Goyer, who has brought comic books to life in films. We are fans of the property; it's a property that David loves and wanted to bring to screen. For us, it's a dream come true. It would never occur to us to be anything less than loyal to the fans.  CNN: Do you understand why fans would be nervous?  Charlie Halford: I totally understand that. I like to think that we're stepping up to the plate, at least with this show. The greatest compliment we can hope to receive is the blessing of die-hard "Hellblazer" fans. Everyone involved with the show have become relatively big fans of the comic book. You keep wanting to read one story then the next and the next. I asked the writers, what's the "bible" for this show? They said, "It's the 'Hellblazer' comic." I took great confidence in that.  Ryan: A very good friend of mine has his own comic book company, and for years, he's been telling me about John Constantine being his favorite comic book character and "Hellblazer" his favorite book. Ever since I got the part, he keeps sending me emails: "Why don't you do this storyline or that storyline?" It's like I've got my own personalized fan who's feeding me all the great things about the character. I didn't know that much about it until I delved about the comics, and the more I'm reading, the more I'm loving.  CNN: Compared with "The Walking Dead," for example, how much of the show is directly from the comic?  Halford: You've got 350 issues of a comic book that ran for almost 30 years. If we ever needed a storyline, they just go right back to the comic books. With some of these episodes we've been shooting recently, it's as though these characters walked right off the page. Hopefully, that resonates with the fans.  Cerone: Our perceived story arc is based on his first appearance in "Swamp Thing." They were facing this menace called the "rising darkness," a force trying to create this climate of fear across the world, to enable a large evil to be born into the world. That arc from "Swamp Thing" is exactly what we're bringing to "Constantine." Week to week, we have to find our own stories. Sometimes they're from the comics, sometimes not.  Ryan: To be honest, I've tried to absorb the comics and let that influence me. You have to stay true to the essence of it, but you have to give it your take as well. The most important thing for me was, what is John about? It's just trying to find that and how I connect to that. There's bits of me in there as well and fleshing it out as well.  Cerone: It's a little bit easier for us, since we're not a show about superheroes, and John Constantine doesn't have superpowers. In a way, we're more of a horror show than a comic-book show. For us, as a horror show, it might be easier than other straight comic-book adaptations. For us, the draw of the show was the character himself. John Constantine is a character we haven't seen on television. He isn't afraid to thumb his nose at any form of evil. He's just a really fun, inventive character. His costume is a trench coat and a skinny tie. He fits our reality.  CNN: "Hellblazer" was definitely a book for mature audiences. What can you get away with at 10 p.m. on a Friday on network TV?  Cerone: We're always trying to find that balance. To NBC's credit, more often than not, we'll turn in a script or a cut of an episode, and NBC will say, "Take it further; make it more extreme." They'll push us to make it darker. They understand the way people watch television, at least for this kind of show. David Goyer and myself are censoring ourselves with what you can and can't do on television, and it's NBC that's telling us to take it further.  
 Stomping through the fields and industrial wastelands of Britain, this giant six-legged walking robot is a world first, say its creators.  Weighing in at 1,900 kilograms (4,190 pounds) and measuring 2.8 meters (9.1 feet) tall, Mantis is the biggest all-terrain operational hexapod in the world, according to Winchester-based animatronics and robotics company Micromagic Systems.  Chief engineer Matt Denton spent three years designing and testing the machine before completing a successful test drive last year.  Denton started building hexapods in 2001his smaller robots have even featured in the "Harry Potter" film series.  "My fascination with walking machines started at a young age watching sci-fi films such as 'The Empire Strikes Back,'" he explains.  "Seeing the imposing images of an AT-AT (All Terrain Armored Transport) walking across a snowscape really got me fascinated with the concept of using legged locomotion on vehicles."  Mantis has already cost Denton "hundreds of thousands of pounds," but there are still plenty of engineering challenges to overcome, he says.  The hydraulic power pack and legs could be "much lighter and more efficient" while the 2.2-liter turbo diesel engine would benefit from being "more modern."  Denton hopes to show off the fruits of his labor at events around the UK this summer.

Los Angeles In the wake of a teacher misconduct scandal, Los Angeles school officials have referred the discipline cases of 604 teachers from the past four years to state authorities to decide whether the teachers' licenses should also be revoked, a school spokesman said Thursday.  Of the 604 cases in which teachers were fired or facing discipline, 60 teachers were accused of sexual misconduct with pupils on or off campus or with minors who weren't students, school officials told CNN.  The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing will investigate 366 of the 604 teacher cases, spokeswoman Anne Padilla said on Thursday. Most of the cases focused on allegations of teacher misconduct that involved student safety.  The referral of the cases to state licensing investigators is the latest turn in the nation's second largest school system. It has been reeling from a scandal at Miramonte Elementary School, where two teachers have been charged with lewd acts on pupils, including one teacher accused of putting children in adult-like bondage situations and placing semen-filled spoons at their mouths.  The lurid allegations prompted an internal review of the system's handling of past teacher misconduct cases, and the district determined that 604 cases needed to be referred to state licensing authorities for review, though "a substantial number" of other misconduct cases had already been reported to the state, school officials told CNN.  "Protecting California's schoolchildren is always a priority for the commission. The workload has been a challenge, but a necessary one," commission executive director Mary Vixie Sandy said in a statement.  The 604 cases include teachers who were disciplined or were about to face discipline since July 2008, according to Ira Berman, Los Angeles Unified School District director of employee relations, and Vivian Ekchian, the district's chief human resources officer.  The cases also include teachers who were fired by the school board or who left the district after termination proceedings were initiated or while an allegation of misconduct was pending, Berman and Ekchian said.  The system doesn't know whether any of the teachers who were fired or who left the district are still in the classroom in other school districts, according to Berman and Ekchian.  The 604 figure also includes teachers who were suspended for 11 days or more for a variety of reasons not involving sexual misconduct with students, the two officials said.  "The safety of our students is our No. 1 priority," Ekchian said in explaining why the system referred the 604 cases to the state.  The United Teachers Los Angeles, the teachers' union, had no comment Thursday on the school board's action, spokeswoman Marla Eby said.  The system's internal investigation arose after parental outrage at Miramonte, where a teacher resigned from the system last year but was not referred to the state for possible license revocation, school district spokesman Tom Waldman said.  That person is former teacher Mark Berndt, 61, who pleaded not guilty in February to allegations he bound young students, then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and three-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces, among other graphic depictions.  "We had not informed Sacramento to revoke Mr. Berndt's credentials," Waldman said.  Berndt's teaching credentials have been suspended, Padilla said.  Berndt is being held on $23 million bond and faces 23 counts of lewd acts on a child. The 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said.  Authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by Berndt in his classroom.  Los Angeles School Superintendent John Deasy has said Berndt was removed from his teaching job in January 2011 after school officials learned of the police investigation.  A teacher for 30 years, Berndt initially challenged the school district's decision to dismiss him. But he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned last spring.  His arrest in January led to a broader fallout over the adequacy of safeguards for the school's students and the prospect of more victims.  Days after Berndt was taken into custody, another Miramonte Elementary teacherMartin Springer, 49was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl younger than 14. He has pleaded not guilty.  The school board subsequently shut Miramonte for two days, during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400-student school. Miramonte is in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about six miles south of downtown Los Angeles.  Meanwhile, the California state auditor is going to carry out an emergency $300,000 audit of the Los Angeles Unified School District's actions in managing and documenting child abuse claims, said State Assemblyman Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, who sponsored the performance audit proposal.  The incident at Miramonte and similar allegations of child sex abuse at other Los Angeles public schools prompted the audit, Lara said.  CNN's Jaqueline Hurtado contributed to this report.  
 The World Health Organization raised the swine flu alert Thursday to its highest level, saying the H1N1 virus has spread to enough countries to be considered a global pandemic.  Kindergarten students, some wearing masks, attend school in a residential estate in Hong Kong on Thursday.  Increasing the alert to Phase 6 does not mean that the disease is deadlier or more dangerous than before, just that it has spread to more countries, the WHO said.  "This is an important and challenging day for all of us," WHO Director General Margaret Chan said in a briefing with reporters. "We are moving into the early days of the first flu pandemic of the 21st century."  The last previous pandemic occurred in 1968.  As of Thursday, the virus had spread to 74 countries, the health agency said. There were 28,774 confirmed cases and 144 deaths.  The United States had 13,217 cases and 27 deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said June 5 in its weekly update. Cases have been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  See where H1N1 flu cases are in the U.S.   The U.S. death toll is expected be higher when the CDC releases its latest figures Friday, said Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.  New Englandparticularly Massachusettsand the New York and New Jersey areas have been hit the hardest, Schuchat said Thursday at a CDC news conference.  The Phase 6 pandemic designation had been widely expected for weeks.  "Further spread is considered inevitable," Chan said at a news conference at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. "The scientific criteria for an influenza pandemic have been met."  The announcement came after a meeting of the WHO's Emergency Committee, which has debated since April whether the spread of a novel H1N1 flu virus was fast and widespread enough to warrant a Phase 6 designation.  Phase 6, Chan said, is meant as a signal to countries to recalibrate their strategies to minimize the harm from swine flu. In countries where the virus and the response to it are already widespread, it is not likely to mean significant changes, but Chan urged countries that have not seen cases, or seen only limited cases, to get ready.  "The virus is not stoppable," she said. "I would advise them to maintain vigilance, enhance surveillance and be prepared for the arrival of the novel H1N1 in their country."  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security said those agencies have been acting for weeks as if Phase 6 were already in effect and no additional measures would be put into effect.  The United States declared a public health emergency April 26.  "WHO continues to recommend no restriction on travel and on border closures," Chan said.  Discussions about shifting to Phase 6 have been under way for weeks. Chan indicated that a major factor in the decision was surveillance from countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is under way. In Chile and Australia, two countries with many flu cases, she said H1N1 appears to be the dominant strain, "crowding out" the seasonal influenza virus.  Chan said she would recommend that vaccine manufacturers proceed with mass production of an inoculation against the new swine flu strain as soon as they finish production of seasonal vaccine, which she estimated would be complete in about two weeks.  HHS spokesman Bill Hall said Thursday that no decision has been made on full-scale production because there is no need yet to make that decision.  It is a step-by-step process that is moving forward. "We're doing as much as we can now," he said.  The agency awarded a contract several weeks ago to five manufacturers to develop an H1N1 antigen. The companies are producing pilot lots. Clinical testing will take place over the summer, Hall said.  At the end of the summer, HHS will decide whether to go into production.  "There's no specific date on the calendar," Hall said.  If officials decide to produce a vaccine, the first doses would be ready early in the fall. Hall noted that even full-scale production doesn't mean there will be an immunization campaign. Federal officials may have a vaccine and decide not to use it, he said.  Also Thursday, authorities in Hong Kong ordered the closure of all elementary schools, kindergartens and day care centers in the city after 12 students were found to be infected with the virus.  Authorities have not determined the source of the infection, said Hong Kong's Chief Executive Donald Tsang. This makes it the first cluster of swine flu cases in the city without a link to someone who had traveled overseas.  The schools and day care centers were told to close for 14 days as investigators tried to identify the source of the infection, said Tsang, the chief executive.  The health department will decide after two weeks whether to continue the shutdown.  Also on Thursday, Israel's health ministry announced that the number of people diagnosed with swine flu there was 68.  Health officials use the virus' clinical nameH1N1to reflect that it's actually a combination of several different types of flu and to reduce confusion about whether eating pork can spread the virus. It cannot.  CNN's David S. Martin, Roya Shadravan in Hong Kong, and Michal Zippori in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

An Ohio distributor is recalling about 6 million Chinese-made tire valve stems after concluding that some of them were improperly made and could increase the risk of accidents.  An Ohio distributor is recalling 6 million Chinese-made car tire valve stems.  Tech International, the part's Johnstown, Ohio-based distributor, estimates that just 8,600 of roughly 6 million of those valves are defective.  The valve is a replacement snap-in tire valveModel No. TR413manufactured between July and November 2006.  It was imported by Tech International from manufacturer Shanghai Baolong Industries Co. in Shanghai, China, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  According to the recall, the rubber part of the valve may crack after being in use for about six months, causing a gradual loss of tire pressure.  Continuing to drive on underinflated tires can cause them to burst, possibly leading to crashes.  Tech International told the NHTSA that the company doesn't have records of the final purchasers of the valve stems.  According to the company, the defect was identified after "a small number" of the valves were reported by customers and one distributor to have failed.  The samples were shipped to China, and, in March, Baolong concluded that some valves could be defective.  "The cause of the defect is likely improper mixing of the rubber compound in the manufacturer's facility," Tech International wrote in a letter to the transportation safety authority.  
 The coroner who conducted the inquest into the death of Amy Winehouse has resigned, raising the possibility that the case could be reopened.  Assistant Deputy Coroner Suzanne Greenaway ruled in October that Winehouse, who was found dead on July 23rd, died of accidental alcohol poisoning.  Greenaway resigned in November after officials discovered that she had not been a registered lawyer in the United Kingdom for the required five years. Her resignation was not made public until today.  Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Greenaway was appointed to her post by her husband, Andrew Reid, who serves as a London coroner himself. In a statement, Reid said that he was under the impression that his wife's tenure as a registered lawyer in her native Australia qualified her for the post. The Camden Council, the local authority in the matter, said it believed Reid "had made an error in good faith."  Reid indicated he would be willing to perform any of Greenaway's inquests again if the families of the deceased requested it. Winehouse's family said they are consulting with attorneys and have not yet decided whether to pursue a new inquest.  See the full article at RollingStone.com.

Applauding budget-cutting measures taken and proposed by Greece's government in the face of intense public pressure, European finance ministers announced Monday that Athens is on track to receive fresh loans in mid-July.  "The Greek authorities are embarking on a significant and necessary adjustment effort," said members of the Eurogroup, which consists of officials from countries in the Euro economic zone, in a statement. "Ministers recognized the considerable progress achieved by the Greek authorities over the last year (and) are also conscious of the serious challenges that Greek citizens are facing in these difficult times."  No specifics were given on the extent or parameters of the loans, which would be the second round in the bailout aimed at keeping Greece solventand preventing its economic crisis from worsening and spreading through Europe and beyond.  While Athens is on track for the new loans, the ministers said they were contingent on completing a planned "compliance report," finalizing details through ongoing negotiations with European officials and taking other steps, including continuing austerity measures.  "This, together with the passing of key laws on the fiscal strategy and privatization by the Greek parliament, will pave the way for the next disbursement (of loans)," the finance ministers said.  The Eurogroup also said "voluntary roll-overs of existing Greek debt" would be permitted under the strict parameters of its bailout plan. The ministers explained the relaxed move was needed given that Athens likely won't get access to private market funds until early next year.  This statement came a day after Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou called for lawmakers to back his latest round of budget-cutting measures, telling them, "The government must stop spending more than it takes in."  He's fighting to stay in power in the face of weeks of protests against plans for measures to bring down the country's budget deficit and get a second international bailout.  He reshuffled his Cabinet on Friday and is seeking a vote of confidence in his new ministers as his party clings to a wafer-thin majority in parliament.  Two days after his appointment as finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos attended talks Sunday on a second economic bailout package for his debt-strapped country as part of a two-day meeting on Europe's economic outlook in Luxembourg. The former defense minister also took over the post of deputy prime minister.  The Greek bailout tops the agenda of the meeting of the Eurogroup and Economic and Finance Ministers Council, which representatives of the International Monetary Fund will also attend, according to an EU news release. The IMF is contributing to the bailouts of European Union member countries.  IMF staff members will present their assessment of Europe's economy. They and the finance ministers will examine existing bailouts for Ireland and Portugal, as well as the economic progress in those countries.  Ireland is poised to meet proposed austerity conditions for the second quarter, according to the EU, and has received second-quarter disbursements. Portugal has met requirements for the first payments of its bailout package.  The crisis raises concerns for Europe's currency, the euro. A default on its debts by Greece, or another struggling nation such as Portugal or Ireland, could adversely affect the world economy.  The harsh reforms designed to help reduce Greece's enormous budget deficit have so far led to tax hikes and public-sector job losses alongside already record-high unemployment.  There are fears that efforts to restructure Greece's debt could send shock waves through Europe's banking sector and spark investor panic similar to that in the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the U.S.-based global investment bank.  Venizelos addressed the Greek nation Friday, urging consensus in solving the crisis.  "Our priority is the viability and sustainability of the public debt," he said. "There is no disagreement on this issue."  Papandreou faces opposition from his party over the austerity measures needed to secure an additional bailout package.  The IMF said Thursday that it would continue to back Greece provided that Greece carried out the economic policy reforms agreed upon by the government.  The Greek government's popularity has plunged recently, and anti-government protests turned violent Wednesday, as demonstrators threw gasoline bombs at the finance ministry and police fired tear gas at protesters, police said.  On June 9, the Cabinet approved a tough five-year plan for 2011-15 and introduced a bill in Parliament to put austerity measures into effect.  The latest measures include further cuts in public spending, more tax increases and the faster privatization of state-held assets, including utilities, ports and airports.  The government proposes reducing the public-sector workforce by 150,000; workers will also face changes in working hours, practices and wages. The plan also sets out changes to social benefits, including pensions and unemployment aid.  According to the finance ministry, these measures will help achieve 28.3 billion euros ($40.5 billion) in cuts from 2012 to 2015, and shrink Greece's public deficit to less than 3% of gross domestic product, in accordance with the EU target.  The government has said the passage of these additional measures is essential to Greece's securing the fifth portion of the first 110 billion euro ($158 billion) bailout package that Greece signed with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to prevent the country from defaulting on its debts.  CNN's Diana Magnay and Ben Brumfield and journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.  
 During his travels around the nation, meeting countless working men and women, Mike Rowe has certainly seen many different ways to make a livingsome more dangerous than others.  Before becoming the host of CNN's new series "Somebody's Gotta Do It," Rowe hosted a Discovery Channel series called "Dirty Jobs." After an episode that took place on an oil rig, Rowe received a job-safety question from a fan.  "My husband works on the oil rigs as a well tester," wrote "suzemommy." "We watched you folks do so without any eye protection! Are you crazy? Drilling a hole with no protective eyewear? Between him, a well tester, and me, a workers' compensation lawyer, we're cringing! Somebody could LOSE AN EYE! SeriouslySafety First, fellas! I would expect better from the Discovery Channel!!"  Rowe responded, "I sincerely appreciate your concern for me, and agree that stupidity plays an ongoing role in my professional and personal life. But believe me, I have no wish to be injured on the job.  However, it is not the objective of Dirty Jobs to conform to any particular set of safety standards, other than those dictated by the people for whom I happen to be working at the time. I take my cues from them, and I assume whatever risk they assume, for the most part. In the end, we hope to capture an honest look at what life is like for the workers in a particular venue. We do not aspire to set an example, or be a poster child for OSHA or any particular industry. I realize that may sound controversial, but it's the truth, and not nearly as inflammatory as what I'm going to say next.  Ready?  Of all the platitudes automatically embraced in the workplaceand there are manythere is none more pervasive, erroneous, overused, and dangerous, than "Safety First!" in my opinion.  I have heard this slogan countless times. I have seen it emblazoned on banners, T-shirts and hats. I have sat through mandatory briefings and slideshows and presentations designed to "protect me from the hazards at hand." And I have listened as safety officers and foreman have run down list after list of OSHA requirements, all apparently construed to remind me that nothing is more important to the employer than my own well-being. What a load of unmitigated nonsense.  In the jobs I have seen thus far, I can tell you with certainty, that safety, while always a major consideration, is never the priority.  Never.  Never, ever.  Not even once.  Is it important? Of course. But is it more important than getting the job done? No. Not even close. Making money is more important than safetyalwaysand it's very dangerous in my opinion to ignore that. When we start to believe that someone else is more concerned about our own safety than we are, we become complacent, and then, we get careless. When a business tells you that they are more concerned with your safety than anything else, beware. They are not being honest. They are hedging their own bets, and following the advice of lawyers hired to protect them from lawsuits arising from accidents.  You are correct to suggest that wearing safety glasses would have made the task at hand safer. But why stop there? Wearing a helmet would have made it safer still. And wearing a steel mesh shark suit would have made it really, super safe.  I know that sounds glib, and I know that many will wish to scold me for appearing cavalier. But really, I'm not. In a car, I wear a safety belt. On a motorcycle, I wear a helmet. Not because it's the law, but because it seems a reasonable precaution. And ultimately, the only one responsible for my own safety is me. (Besides, if the government were really concerned with my safety above all else, wouldn't they drop the legal speed limit to 30 miles an hour and make cars out of rubber?)  Again, you're rightI probably should have been wearing safety glasses, not because safety is first, but because I like to hedge my bets.  We can always be safer. We can always assume less risk. But if safety were really first, I wouldn't travel at all, or engage in any activity that required me to assume any risk. And I certainly wouldn't be hosting Dirty Jobs."

American journalist Michael Scott Moore, held for more than two years by Somali pirates, has been freed, Moore's family and a Somali official told CNN on Tuesday.  "We are just elated," Marlis Saunders, Moore's mother, said in a brief conversation. "It took a lot of work for us to get this point. And to hear he is freejust joyful, I can't describe it."  "All this is just so new," said Saunders, who lives in Redondo Beach, California. "I did not have much time to talk with him. We just have a lot of things to do and I cannot talk anymore. We need a little time to evaluate all this."  The governor of Somalia's Mudug region, Ahmed Muse, told CNN that local elders negotiated Moore's release, adding that the journalist is "physically and mentally" worn out.  Moore boarded a plane at an airport in Galkayo, in the north-central part of Somalia, Muse said.  Muse would not say where the journalist is headed.  "I'm absolutely thrilled," said Michel Todd, who was Moore's web editor at Pacific Standard magazine. "It's like seeing somebody come back from the dead. It's a marvelous resurrection."  Todd said Moore was a weekly freelance columnist who wrote often about Somalia. He had been researching Somali pirates.  "As a news organization, we wanted to write about his capture," Todd said. "But we had been encouraged by the FBI and State Department to (not) write about it because this would hurt his cause. They said, if you really care about the guy, that is not a good idea, raising his profile would make his release more difficult."  Todd said Moore's stories suggested that illegal European fishing was driving Somalis into piracy.  "Of all the people for the pirates to nab," he said. "He wasn't necessarily a spokesman, but he was someone who was more amenable to getting (the pirates') point across. I'm not saying he was pro-pirate, but he was pro-truth and that seemed like something that might have been helpful to Somalis."  Maria Streshinsky, editor of Pacific Standard, said, "We are thrilled, but it has been really far too long. It's been such a worrisome situation. We are just elated. We may have a toast and a beer in his honor. I hope he is healthy."  Pacific Standard is a publication of the Miller-McCune Center for Research, Media and Public Policy, a California-based nonprofit. PSmag.com claims to reach nearly one million readers each month with research-based articles about the social sciences,  Moore's mother declined to comment when asked if a ransom was paid for her son.  Muse said he did not know if a ransom was paid.  In lawless Somalia, it's commonparticularly among piratesthat people are kidnapped and their freedom negotiated for ransom. The pirates operate in the Gulf of Aden, one of the globe's most trafficked shipping waterways.  The U.S. State Department confirmed in January 2012 that officials had spoken with Moore's family and been in touch with contacts in Kenya and Somalia to get more information.  The department noted at the time that a travel warning for Somalia cautioned U.S. citizens of the risks of traveling to the country and recommended avoiding it.  Freed journalist Peter Theo Curtis back in the U.S.  CNN's Ray Sanchez and journalist Mohamed Sheikh Nor in Somalia contributed to this report.  
 A Massachusetts teenager faces a pretrial hearing in April on involuntary manslaughter charges for allegedly sending text messages urging a friend to commit suicide, even after he expressed second thoughts, authorities said Saturday.  Michelle Carter, 18, was indicted on February 5.  Conrad Roy, 18, of Fairhaven and Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, was found dead in his car of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning on July 13, Sgt. Kevin Kobza, public information officer for the Fairhaven Police Department, said Saturday.  At one point the night of Roy's death, he exited the vehicle and communicated to Carter that he was having second thoughts about taking his own life, Kobza told CNN. Carter then urged him via text message to get back in the car, Kobza said.  Upon searching Roy's cell phone, police discovered "hundreds" of texts between Roy and Carter, many which contained language from Carter that encouraged Roy to take his own life, Kobza said.  "Instead of attempting to assist him or notify his family or school officials, Ms. Carter is alleged to have strongly influenced his decision to take his own life, encouraged him to commit suicide and guided him in his engagement of activities which led to his death," Gregg Miliote, director of communications for the Bristol County District Attorney's Office, said in a statement.  Carter's lawyer, Joseph Cataldo, said Saturday that the evidence will show this was not manslaughter and that Carter attempted to console Roy on "many occasions."  "The facts that have been given out to the public at this point put her in the worst possible light," Cataldo said. "My heart goes out to the family, but this was a young man who planned this for months and months."  On a Twitter page confirmed by the District Attorney's Office to be Carter's, several photos and tweets about Roy have been posted since his death. One tweet reads, "I can't believe today already marks 4 months without you. I love you and miss you always Conrad..."  In September 2014, Carter organized a softball tournament in Roy's memory and raised $2,300 for mental health awareness, according to Kobza.  Carter was arraigned on the indictment on February 6 in New Bedford Juvenile Court, released on $2,500 bail and told not to use social media, according to Miliote.  Carter was indicted as a youthful offender because she was not yet 18 when the alleged crimes occurred. Youthful offenders are tried in juvenile court but the proceedings are public, Cataldo said.  Because of a familial relationship he has with the victim's family, Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn recused himself from the investigation and prosecution of this case, the District Attorney's Office said.  Carter's pretrial hearing is set for April 17.

San Diego Politicians in both parties might have seriously miscalculated. The election returns aren't in yet, so we can't know for sure. Still, if trends continue, this could turn out to be a bad year for fear.  When this election season started several months ago, Republicans and Democrats thought they'd scare up a few votes by accusing their opponents of being, let's see, soft on the border, determined to take away women's reproductive rights, simpatico with tea party extremists, incapable of protecting America from terrorists or deadly viruses, eager to impeach the President, or even intent on dragging us back to one of our country's darkest chapters by bringing back lynching.  You think I'm exaggerating? Perhaps a little, but not much. Have you taken a look at the campaign fliers in your mailbox? Be warned. They're pretty scary. This October, every day felt like Halloween.  Whether it was coming from Republicans or Democrats, the message was pretty much the same: "Boo!" Or in the long form, it went like this: "You're in danger!"  And Candidate XYZ is going to make you even less safe and more vulnerable. You need to protect yourself and your family, and vote against Candidate XYZ. And hey, look, I'm on the ballot, too. So why not vote for me as a safer alternative?"  This isn't your usual surge of negative campaigning, where candidates sling mud and attack one another's character, honesty or integrity. Americans are used to that. In fact, hopefully, they're largely immune to it by now.  This is much worse. What was on display in many of this year's Senate races was the politics of fear, where politicians are so desperate to get elected or re-elected that they use inflammatory commercials and wild accusations to terrify the same group of voters who they should be trying to inspire with a hopeful and confident message.  When will they learn that positive messages are always stronger than negative ones? This lesson was not lost on two of the most successful politicians in the last half of the 20th century: Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Both men were happy warriors whose hopeful messages triumphed over the doom and gloom peddled by their opponents.  The good news is that, this year, it doesn't seem as if this strategy have worked out very well for the fear mongers. Look at the polls in races where specific candidates have tried to scare voters away from their opponents: Fear is on the run in North Carolina, where a third party group's campaign mailer in support of Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, which was clearly aimed at African-Americans, warned that electing Republican challenger Thom Tillis would set the stage for the immediate impeachment of President Barack Obama. The faded image in the background: a lynching.  So if Hagan isn't re-elected, the nation's first African-American president is headed for a political lynching? That's shameful but not exactly subtle. In the same contest, the Senate Majority PAC released a radio ad slamming Tillis for his support for Stand Your Ground Laws "that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin." So Tillis somehow contributed to the 2012 death of Martin? Outrageous. Fear is on the run in Texas, Arizona, California and New Mexico where Republicans want to scare voters into thinking that ISIS and Ebolaor perhaps even ISIS militants infected with Ebolaare salsa dancing across a porous U.S.-Mexican border.  There's no evidence that either ISIS or Ebola is coming across the border, and the Department of Homeland Security has called the idea "categorically false." Consequently, that line of attack isn't gaining any traction in key races in border states. Even in those races where Republicans are favored, the scare tactics don't seem to winning over independent voters who wouldn't normally support the GOP.  Why doesn't the Republican Party just be honest and go back to what GOP elected officials in the Southwest have always portrayed as the real threat: Invading hordes of Mexicans who steal the worst and dirtiest jobs? Maybe Republicans are the ones who are afraid. Maybe they're concerned that, if they said this, they would sound racist. Imagine that. And, most of all, fear is on the run in Colorado, where Republican Cory Gardner maintains a narrow lead over Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in most polls.  Technically, the race is a toss-up, but given that Udall had the money and name recognition that comes with being the incumbent, it's no wonder that Democrats are bracing for a defeat. Udall bet all his marbles on the female vote, but then he proceeded to insult that constituency by overplaying his hand.  Forgetting that women care about issues such as the economy and terrorism as much as men do, Udall pushed the issue of abortion rights to the point where the senator has been mockingly dubbed: "Mark Uterus." This was not a good re-election strategy for Udall, but it has turned out to be good for the Gardner campaign.  Even with all this election year negativity, there is a positive side. One group of voters after anotherfrom African-Americans to pro-border security conservatives to womenhave, whether they realize it or not, been given a valuable gift.  On Tuesday, they have the opportunity to shrug off the soundbites, declare their independence from the politics of fear and send a message of their own. From this point on, they need to insist upon something that elected officials don't always give voters: respect.  
 The road was melting.  Extreme heat from thermal features at Yellowstone National Park, created by the active volcano below the park, caused oil to bubble on a road surface on July 9 and damage it.  Park crews had to close and repair the 3.3-mile loop road that takes visitors past White Dome Geyser, Great Fountain Geyser and Firehole Lake.  Blame it on the Yellowstone Volcano.  Yellowstone National Parka UNESCO World Heritage Sitesits atop one of the world's largest volcanoes, and some of the thermal spots have damaged the popular Firehole Lake Drive. The park features over 10,000 thermal spots, about half the world's known thermal spots.  Yellowstone: One of the first UNESCO World Heritage Sites  Although the volcano is activeevidenced by the thermal features and 1,000 to 3,000 earthquakes annuallypark officials don't expect a catastrophic eruption anytime in the next 1,000 or even 10,000 years.  Yellowstone's first supervolcanic eruption occurred 2.1 million years ago, and there were other Yellowstone supereruptions 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago.  The park has instruments monitoring the volcano throughout the park, and there would be plenty of warningweeks or even monthsif an eruption were going to occur.  In the meantime, enjoy the park!

Is this the end of "Gangnam Style" mania?  Korean pop star PSYwho rose to fame through his YouTube record-breaking video "Gangnam Style"apologized Friday for anti-American lyrics he rapped back in 2004.  That performance resurfaced on CNN's iReport and then circulated widely online. It included lyrics calling for the death of American troops serving in Iraq, not long after news of the brutal slaying of a South Korean hostage by Iraqi insurgentsan incident which sparked anti-American sentiment in South Korea.  In his apology, PSY said his performance had been emotionally charged and was a response to events in the war in Iraq.  "I understand the sacrifices American servicemen and women have made to protect freedom and democracy in my country and around the world," he said in a statement.  He said the song "was part of a deeply emotional reaction to the war in Iraq and the killing of two Korean schoolgirls that was part of the overall anti-war sentiment shared by others around the world at that time."  The girls were struck and killed by a U.S. military vehicle.  PSY continued: "While I'm grateful for the freedom to express one's self, I've learned there are limits to what language is appropriate and I'm deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be interpreted. I will forever be sorry for any pain I have caused by those words.  "While it's important that we express our opinions, I deeply regret the inflammatory and inappropriate language I used to do so."  The lyrics of the song, titled "Dear America," were written by the South Korean rock band N.E.X.T., and PSY was one of three performers rapping out the lyrics on stage.  The lyrics were posted on a then-unvetted CNN iReport in October. The English translation of the Korean lyrics has picked up steam online since then, drawing thousands of views, and then exploding on blogs and social media this week. CNN reached out to the iReporter who brought attention to PSY's anti-American lyrics, but did not receive a response.  CNN was able to translate the lyrics as saying," Kill those f--ing Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives and those who ordered them to torture," and going on to say, "Kill them all slowly and painfully," as well as "daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers."  PSY shook hands with President Barack Obama over the weekend at "Christmas in Washington," a charity music concert where he performed alongside stars such as Diana Ross and Demi Lovato.  Before PSY's D.C. performance, his controversial lyrics led to a petition on whitehouse.gov demanding that he be dropped from the concert. Even as conservative websites picked up the story, the petition was deleted later in the day. The White House website claimed that it violated terms of participation.  Commenters on the original CNN iReport responded with varying viewpoints on the lyrics.  Some expressed outrage over the Korean pop star's alleged call for the slaying American troops. Commenter shin000 said on October 31: "Whatever the reason is, the fact that PSY insulted American Army and their family is changeless. He sang this song because of that accident and public opinion?"  Others praised PSY for speaking up and expressing his anti-war sentiments. Commenter SavvyMike said on October 30: "As an American, this makes me like Psy even more. Glad to see he has the balls to call out America when we are doing evil."  Other commenters lashed out at the iReporter, saying that he misrepresented PSY in his iReport contribution. Commenter jsong9172 said on October 30, 2012: "He is criticizing the US Army, not the country. Do a thorough background research before you scribble something otherwise you'd ruin one's life."  After the lyrics from the 2004 performance surfaced, there was an often vitriolic response on Twitter:  "So Mr. 'Gangnam Style' @psy_oppa made a song before about America and how all U.S. soldiers should be killed....guy should flee the US now," said @TheOfficialTate.  Fashion publicist/reality star Kelly Cutrone said his "words against the women in my country" were "disgusting," and referred to him as a "poseur faker freak."  @eclecticbrotha defended him saying, "Oh look, we're supposed to hate Psy because he once joined protests against American imperialism."  As for PSY's handling of the criticism, Matt J. Duffy, a journalism teacher from Atlanta, tweeted, "His statement is lesson in good crisis PR."  It's unclear what the fallout of the revelation of these anti-American lyrics will be.  But it has us wonderingwhat do you think the consequences should be? Should a rapper be held accountable for what he said in 2004? Let's talk about it in the comments on this story. You can be sure we'll continue this conversation on CNN for the next few days.  
 London Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has again opened the dispute over sovereignty of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, accusing the British government of blatant colonialism.  Known to the Argentinians as Las Malvinas, the two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands.  In an open letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron and published in British newspapers Thursday, the Argentinian leader said "Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic, thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity."  The British government was swift to respond, insisting that there would be no discussions over sovereignty "unless and until such as the time as the islanders so wish."  It is the latest in a recent series of incidents that has raised tensions between the two countries.  What led to the latest dispute?  The Argentinian president has raised the sovereignty issue several times over the last two years, including a claim at the U.N., but the dispute made global headlines when Prince William, second in line to the British throne, was deployed on a military mission to the islands in 2012. The UK also decided to dispatch the new warship HMS Dauntless to the Falklandsa move that inflamed anger in Argentina which accused Britain of militarizing the South Atlantic.  Tensions were raised again in December when the UK renamed a portion of the British Antarctic Territory as Queen Elizabeth Land in honor of the British head of state Queen Elizabeth II. Argentina also has a claim on some of the territory and lodged a protest with the British.  Last year also saw a public confrontation between the two countries' leaders when Fernandez tried to hand a letter to Cameron at the G-20 summita letter he refused to acceptand there was more bad feeling between the nations ahead of the London 2012 Olympics when Argentina released a video boosting its Olympic team that was filmed on the islands.  Where are the Falklands and why are they important?  Located in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 480 kilometers east of the tip of South America, the windswept Falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources.  Their remoteness, however, exposed them to neglect and complex wrangling over ownership among British, French, Spanish and Argentinian interests. Argentina's forerunners formally declared possession in 1820, prompting Britain to reclaim a sovereignty it originally declared In 1765.  Falklands conflict in photos  Despite regular challenges, notably in 1982, British control has endured and the Falklands' current population of about 3,000 looks to London to safeguard oil, fishing, farming and tourism incomes.  What happened in 1982?  Documents recently revealed under the UK's 30-year rule show that the British government was surprised by the Argentinian invasion of the islands on April 2, 1982, with the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher describing it as "the worst... moment of my life."  In evidence given to the Falkland Islands Review Committee in October 1982, and some months after the war ended, Thatcher said there were no warning signs from Argentina since its 1977 statement saying there would be talks.  "I never, never expected the Argentines to invade the Falklands head-on," she told the committee. "It was such a stupid thing to do, as events happened, such a stupid thing even to contemplate doing."  The files also show that Thatcher's Cabinet was trying to pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis through the help of then U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, while also preparing a military response.  British naval forces were dispatched after Argentinian President Leopoldo Galtieri's military dictatorship put troops on the Falklands. Soldiers fought land battles on the islands, aircraft were shot down and ships were attacked with significant losses of lifemost notably the Argentinian General Belgrano and Britain's HMS Sheffield, HMS Antelope and RFA Sir Galahad.  Britain declared an end to fighting after 74 days and following the surrender of Argentinian troops. Argentina put its death toll at 645. Britain's civil and military losses amounted to 255.  How did the United States and other world powers react?  President Ronald Reagan's administration declared economic sanctions against Argentina. It also gave its Cold War ally a strategic edge by supplying potent Sidewinder missiles to counter Argentina's Exocets.  At the height of the conflict, a meeting of the world's biggest economiesincluding the UK, U.S., Germany, Italy, France, Japan and Canadabacked Britain's position.  Why won't the UK give up the islands like it did Hong Kong?  Britain acknowledges its claim to the Falklands is disputed, but has made clear it has no intention of discussing the sovereignty issue with Argentina.  Professor Clive Schofield, an expert in maritime territorial disputes at Australia's University of Wollongong, said last year that there was no comparison to Hong Kong, which Britain returned to Chinese control after expiry of a set lease in 1997. "The UK position on the Falklands is that they are under British sovereigntythey are not leased from anyone," he said.  What has happened to the islands since the end of the war in 1982?  Spurred by the conflict and stung by accusations of neglect, Britain began taking renewed economic interest in the Falklands. It protected fishing rights and asserted control over oil exploration licenses. It also stepped up its military interests, building a new airfield and bolstering naval, army and air force presences.  Images of life in the Falklands  Cooperation between Britain and Argentinaby now an established democracy whose militarist past has left current leaders distrustful of its armed forceshas improved, but Buenos Aires continued to reject any territorial claim to Las Malvinas other than its own.  The Falkland Islanders are due to hold a referendum on their political status on March 10/11, 2013. According to the Falklands legislative assembly, the vote is intended to affirm islanders' desire to remain a self-governing territory of the United Kingdom and to reject claims of ownership by Argentina.  So why is the language between London and Buenos Aires so tense now?  Analysts have previously pointed to Argentinian politicians seeking to divert voters from the pain caused by inflation and reduced subsidies on oil, gas and electricity.  "The government is being squeezed from lots of different areas, so one way to distract from the economic problems facing the country is to raise the Malvinas issue," Professor Mark Jones, an expert in Latin American politics at Rice University in Texas said last year. "It's one of the few issues outside football that you can get universal consensus on."  In the UK, Camerona successor to Thatcher as leader of the Conservative Partymust be seen to defend the principles of his predecessor who mobilized troops to reclaim the islands.  British Falklands conflict veteran Simon Weston said: "It's not about asserting a claim, it's about allowing people of the Falklands to have the right to self-determination."  What has Argentina done to bolster its claims?  Regional allies were recruited to the cause at the end of 2011, with members of the South American Mercosur trading bloc uniting to ban Falklands-flagged vessels from their ports.  This is largely "diplomatic dressing" that will do little to isolate the islands, Professor Roett Riordan, who heads the Latin American program at John Hopkins University in Washington D.C, said last year.  Is this really all about oil?  Partly. There is Argentinian resentment of a British oil exploration project launched off the Falklands in 2010. This has been worsened by Argentina's recent relegation from exporter to net importer of hydrocarbons.  Analysts, however, insist this remains a sideshow to the political traction offered by the Malvinas dispute.  How much oil is there?  Press reports say up to 8.3 billion barrels of undersea oil reserves could lie in the Falklands economic zonea radius of 320-kilometers around the islands, but despite successful drilling, this quantity is still speculative.  The figures are backed by claims from small oil ventures, including Rockhopper and Borders & Southern Petroleum, which are hoping to raise capital for further exploration in fields licensed by the islands' British-backed government.  Attempts to attract investment in the projects has been hampered by the Anglo-Argentinian dispute. Many major oil firms have interests in Argentina and are wary of upsetting Buenos Aires by involving themselves in the Falklands.  Also a problem is the considerable cost of extracting deep water reserves from the remote South Atlantic.  Professor Alex Kemp, a petroleum economics expert at the University of Aberdeen, described the Falklands oil reserve estimates as "optimistic," adding that even if they are proven, the cost of exploiting them could still be prohibitive.  "It's one thing doing exploration, but when you come to development, we're talking about bigger volumes of materials and to get that there is expensive because at the moment there's nothing therejust sheep farmers," he said.  "It will take a few 100 million barrels to make it worth it, and there's a number of ifs and buts before we get there."  Is conflict likely again?  No, say analysts. While there are parallels with the 1980spoliticians using Anglo-Argentinian tensions to court votes and divert from economic woes at homethere is little appetite for conflict on either side. Any action is likely to remain in the diplomatic sphere.  A former senior British military officer said in early 2012 that UK military cutbacks had left Britain unprepared for another Falklands conflict.  Argentina is apparently in a similar state, with a heavily depleted military that experts say would be no match even for Britain's depleted force. "Even if Argentina wanted to go to war, they have no military capacity," Jones said.  He said Fernandez's own antipathy towards the militarya legacy of her political opposition to Argentina's former dictatorshipmeant she would be unlikely to support even a maritime blockade of British vessels.  
	 'Korean pop star PSYapologized Friday for anti-American lyrics he rapped'
O'Fallon, Missouri Nathan Halbach is 22, with a diagnosis of terminal brain cancer. He knows that "horrible stuff" lies ahead.  His mother, Pat Bond, has been taking care of him full time. But when she needed help, she reached out to the Roman Catholic Church.  After all, his father is a priest.  Nathan was born in 1986, during a five-year affair between his mother and Father Henry Willenborg, the Franciscan priest who celebrated Nathan's baptism. In a story first reported in the New York Times, it was revealed that The Franciscan Order drew up an agreement acknowledging the boy's paternity and agreeing to pay child support in exchange for a pledge of confidentiality.  Now her sonthe youngest of four childrenmay have just weeks to live. And when the Franciscans balked at paying for his care, she decided she was no longer bound by her pledge of confidentiality.  "I never asked for extraordinary amounts. I asked for the basic needs and care of my son," Bond told CNN's "AC 360."  But she said the church told her, "No, we are not Nathan's biological father, we have no legal obligation to your son."  Willenborg, whose priestly vows require celibacy, has been suspended from his most recent assignment, in northern Wisconsin, as Catholic leaders investigate allegations that he was involved with another womanthen in high schoolaround the same time he was seeing Bond. Willenborg has acknowledged his relationship with Bond, but denies any inappropriate relationship with the other woman while she was a minor, according to his current bishop.  And his order acknowledges its agreement to support his son, telling CNN they have paid about $233,000 to support Nathan over his lifetime. Since the affair has become public, the Franciscan Order has agreed to pick up Nathan's medical bills and the costs for the funeral that now appears likely.  Willenborg refused to speak to CNN. But a statement to his parishioners in Ashland, Wisconsin, in September, said, "My failure to be faithful to my vows has caused me and many others pain and disappointment. I have regretted this for a long time."  And in October, he told The New York Times, "We've been very caring, very supportive, very generous over these 20-something years. It's very tragic what's going on with Nathan."  Bond, then Patricia Halbach, said she and Willenborg began their affair in 1983. At the time, Willenborg was a priest in her hometown of Quincy, Illinois, about 130 miles north of St. Louis, Missouri.  Bond, then a 27-year-old, married mother of three, went to a retreat for women with troubled relationships. Willenborg was the retreat's spiritual director, and she said he was a "terrific" priest"incredibly charismatic, very sought-after."  He began to counsel her on a regular basis. After about three months, at the end of one of their sessions, she said he kissed her. Bond said she went home and immediately asked her husband for a separation, and she said she began a romantic relationship with Willenborg.  Bond said she knew he was forbidden to have sex with her. But she said when in love, "You don't think clearly."  "I make stupid decisions in my life," she said. "I am not perfect, far from sainthood, and I loved him."  During their relationship, Bond was a lay leader in the church, and "We were a very good team, a very dynamic team," she said.  But in 1985, she learned she was pregnant. The pregnancy ended with a miscarriage that October. She said in its aftermath, she ended her sexual relationship with Willenborg, only to resume it the following spring. It was during that period that Nathan was conceived, she said.  Nathan was born in December 1986. Willenborg had to disclose the affair and Bond's pregnancy to his superiors. A deal was negotiated by Father Robert Karris, who told CNN the Franciscans insisted on confidentiality "to protect Nathan, his mother, and the priest." But Karris, now on the research faculty of the Franciscan Institute at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, New York, also acknowledged the goal in part was to protect the church.  The agreement was reached about a year after Nathan's birth. Afterward, Willenborg was removed from his job, and it was 17 years before he would lead a congregation again. He told his superiors that his relationship with Bond was over, but she said it continued.  "That was the statement, and they bought it," Bond said. "But the truth of the matter is during those eight month of negotiations, we were living together physically, sexually and every form of relationship there was under their nose."  The relationship went on until Nathan was nearly 2 years old, Bond said. She and Willenborg went on family outings, including a trip to Florida, with Nathan and her children from her previous marriage. Back in Quincy, where she grew up, Bond said she had a simple answer to questions about Nathan's parentage: "He's my baby."  But things ended in 1988, after Bond learned that Willenborg was seeing another woman. She eventually moved from Quincy to a St. Louis suburb.  "You had to go away, you had to take your story, you had to take your children, you had to get out of this town. We're a small community, everybody knew everybody," she said.  Nathan grew up as a popular, athletic boy, a big fan of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball club and the Blues hockey team. He has autographs of the entire hockey team and a Cardinals uniform signed by All-Star first baseman Albert Pujols.  For years, he said, he wanted a relationship with his father.  "He's popped in and out of my life, but I've never gotten the full respect and love out of him that I would always want," he said. But several years ago, after Willenborg took him out to dinner on their first night out in years, he said his father didn't seem to want to have anything to do with him.  "When it comes to this person who's my dad, who should be helping me out more than a person on the street, he hasn't done so throughout my 20-plus years of life," Nathan said.  Nathan was diagnosed with cancer in 2006. Over the summer, he and his mother went to New York's Sloan-Kettering cancer center in a last-ditch effort to halt the disease. It was unsuccessful, and doctors give him a prognosis of weeks.  "If I just live my life as happy as I can, I can have a lot of fun until this horrible stuff happens," he said.  The church had paid for some medical expenses and gave her $1,000 toward travel expenses for the trip, but not room and board or treatment costs, Bond said. And in the past week, she said, the church was questioning the cost of a looming funeral.  "They were concerned with getting us out of their lives, and I guarantee you, the day my son goes, the church will rejoice," she said.  Since she went public, the Franciscans wrote a letter to Bond telling her they will cover 100 percent of her son's funeral costsand added, "Please advise if there is any additional assistance that the Franciscans can provide to Nathan at this time in connection with his day-to-day expenses and comfort." The order also has since said it will not take Bond to court for breaching the confidentiality of the agreement.  For four years before September, Willenborg was a priest at Our Lady of the Lake church in Ashland, Wisconsin. Bishop Peter Christensen, whose diocese includes the church, said Willenborg was a good priestbut added, "Because of his behavior 23 years ago, the community is now suffering."  Nathan will not be going back to the hospital and will die at home, Bond said. She can't afford a part-time nurse to help take care of him in his last days, but said she hopes the church lives up to its word.  
 A Holland America cruise ship was disrupted early Saturday morning by an intoxicated passenger who released the ship's anchor, according to an affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun website.  California resident Rick Ehlert, 44, released the anchor and a life buoy between 5:25 a.m. and 5:55 a.m., according to the affidavit.  The MS Ryndam was unharmed, but the release of the anchor could have caused "significant damage to the ship's rudder or propeller, which could disable the ship's ability to maneuver, or puncturing of the ship, which could result in sinking or severe flooding," according to the affidavit.  The ship was traveling from Costa Maya, Mexico, to Tampa, Florida.  A surveillance video shows Ehlert taking multiple steps to deploy the anchor while the ship was in motion. The MS Ryndam's maximum speed is 22 knots, which is approximately 25 mph, according to Holland America's website.  Ehlert confessed to dropping the ship's anchor when questioned by special agents from the FBI. He admitted to being intoxicated at the time and detailed the multiple steps he took in deploying the anchor, including entering an area marked as off-limits to passengers.  "There is probable cause to believe on November 27 that Rick Ehlert did attempt to damage, destroy, disable, or wreck a vessel," FBI agent John Manning stated in the affidavit.  Ehlert was arrested Sunday on a felony charge and taken into custody. He has not yet hired an attorney, according to the office of the magistrate who is handling the case.

In a $40 million federal lawsuit, five people arrested recently in Ferguson, Missouri, accuse police of using "wanton and excessive force" and treating U.S. citizens "as if they were war combatants."  A complaint filed Thursday alleges that police officers from Ferguson and St. Louis County used unnecessary force and made unjustified arrests as they cracked down on protests after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown earlier this month.  The lawsuit lists Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, Ferguson officer Justin Cosma, several unnamed officers and the city and county governments as defendants.  A St. Louis County police spokesman declined to comment Friday, referring inquiries to the county prosecuting attorney's office. The St. Louis County prosecuting attorney's office told CNN it has no comment on the lawsuit.  The suitwhich includes accusations of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, and assault and batterydetails circumstances allegedly surrounding several arrests between August 11-13: Tracey White was about to buy an ice cream sundae at McDonald's when officers "in what appeared to be army uniforms, carrying rifles and sticks and wearing helmets" entered and ordered her to leave, according to the lawsuit. She was told to shut up, thrown to the ground and handcuffed after criticizing officers for the way they were treating her son, the lawsuit claims. Dewayne Matthews was walking to his mother's house when a group of officers in military uniforms shot rubber bullets at him, the lawsuit alleges. He fell into a creek or sewer, the suit says, where officers "pounced on him, slammed his face into the concrete, and pushed his head into the water to the point that he felt he was going to be drowned." Kerry White was shooting footage and holding his camera out his car window when an officer snatched his camera, "took out his memory card and threw it to the ground," the lawsuit says. Damon Coleman and Theophilus Green were peacefully protesting, the lawsuit says, when police in riot gear fired tear gas and what appeared to be stun grenades in their direction, then "hurled racial epithets at them, while punching and kicking them the entire time."  CNN has not independently confirmed details of the arrests.  Police tactics to calm the crowds drew sharp criticism, including a rebuke from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.  "At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message," Holder said as the protests unfolded.  As criticism of police tactics mounted, Gov. Jay Nixon Missouri tapped State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson to head up security in Ferguson on August 14.  This week, Johnson said police were scaling back their efforts in Ferguson now that the situation has cooled.  Belmar, the St. Louis County Police Chief, told reporters on Wednesday that he doesn't regret his agency's decisions to fire tear gas at protesters. That approach, he said, was much better than using nightsticks or dogs.  Even though President Barack Obama has called for a review of military equipment sales to local police departments in light of the clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, Belmar said that such equipment is often necessary.  "I never envisioned a day that we would ever see that kind of equipment used against protesters," he said. "But I also never imagined a day in 28 years when we would see that kind of criminal activity spin out of peaceful demonstrations."  Complete coverage  
 Des Moines, Iowa From church pews to cheeseburger joints, Iowa's faithful are a major prize in the political ground war raging between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.  Of the roughly 3 million Iowans, about 30% call themselves evangelical or Catholic. Fifty-seven percent of Iowans who voted in the caucuses this year were evangelical Christians.  Evangelicals overwhelmingly supported Rick Santorum over Romney in the Iowa caucuses, helping Santorum squeeze out a slight victory in the final count.  In Des Moines, evangelical Christians flock to Grace Church, affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, to talk faith, family and the presidential election. The evangelical voters we met strongly supported Romney, but they also expressed a general unease about his moderate history on social issues such as abortion.  Obama, Romney paths to victory cross in Iowa  "His (Romney's) past positions in terms of abortion or in terms of his record in Massachusettsit's not been an easy choice to make either way," Mwasi Mwamba said. Mwamba said he has no party affiliation and voted early.  His wife, Dawn, plans to vote for Romney but said her religious beliefs don't align with either candidate. "I have to look at it, though I hate saying it this way, as the lesser of two evils if you will."  The Undecided Evangelical: Radical for Jesus, dubious of Romney  Sheri Hess described herself as having a "biblical worldview." Hess plans to vote for Romney this year but admitted his record on social issues concerns her. "He's definitely not a Christian in my view," she said when asked if Romney's Mormon faith plays into her vote. But she said she thinks he supports the Christian beliefs she holds dear.  One evangelical voter not supporting Romney is Mike Pike. He won't vote for either candidatehe's not casting a ballot in a presidential election for the first time in his life. Pike said the two non-negotiable issues for him are abortion and the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman.  Ohio: Overwhelmed by ads  Obama and Romney, he said, have "failed on both of those." "What a person says and what they do, when they're two different things, I have to go by what they've done so therefore I can't support either candidate in this election."  In December, ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Steve Scheffler, president of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, said the Romney campaign "has a very deliberate plan to snub social conservatives."  But this week in Des Moines, he had changed his tune, saying Romney has "proved that he has tried to make that outreach to social conservatives and economic conservatives and he's done a good job in Iowa."  For Catholic voters, it's the first time they've had a choice between two ticketseach with a Catholic on it.  Battleground Blog: A deeper look inside the swing states  In traditionally democratic Dubuque, some Catholic voters are split over issues such as abortion, funding for contraception and same-sex marriage. They disagree on how best to help the poorthrough government-run social programs or private charity.  "(There are) the life issues which most Catholics hold dear and central to their faith, but then there's this belief that remains that the Democratic Party somehow cares for the poor better. I think it somehow comes down to that tension," said Dawn Luekin, a Catholic voter and member of St. Joseph the Worker parish in Dubuque. She's a fervid opponent of abortion, as is her mother, Ellen Markham, who said the top issues for her in this election are "life and sanctity of marriage." Both support Romney.  Quiz: Which Jesus do you believe in?  At the Village Inn restaurant in Dubuque, Jenni, a Catholic voter and Obama supporter who didn't want to share her last name, said she was concerned about backlash from co-workers. She cast an early vote for Obama this year. She's pro-abortion rights and calls it one of the top issues for her in this election but maintains her religion does not affect her vote.  10 things you didn't know about Iowa  Sue, a practicing Catholic who also declined to give her last name, was eating a cheeseburger when we chatted with her at the Village Inn. She said it is hard to reconcile abortion with her religious beliefs but said she is supporting Obama. "I can't bring myself to just vote on that one issue."  But for Caroline Koppes, who is Catholic and an Obama campaign volunteer in Dubuque, it's clear-cut. "I just think we have got to get out of the bedrooms, and if we're against big government and we are knocking on the doors of every bedroom that is ridiculous."  Romney's vision for America  Then there are the coveted undecided voters, such as retiree Lois Nilles. She's fed up with the partisan bickering in Washington. She said she thinks Obama has done a "fairly good job" considering tough opposition from Republicans in Congress, but as a practicing Catholic she is bothered by his abortion-rights stance.  Obama's vision for America  Complicating the president's relationship with Catholics in an election year, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has been vocal in its opposition of the Obama administration's rule requiring health insurers to provide free contraceptive coverage. Catholic teaching opposes contraception and considers some methods of contraception to be tantamount to abortion.  Nationwide, Obama won 54% of the Catholic vote in 2008 and 26% of the evangelical vote, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.  Those religious votes are key in Iowaa battleground state with six electoral votesor as folks here call it, a "purple state."  Election campaign ends with chess match in swing states

P.K. Keen, head of U.S. Southern Command, told CNN at the hospital. He said the troops were providing some security there.  4:11 p.m.A clarification on the death toll: At least 72,000 bodies have been recovered since the earthquake, and that doesn't include bodies buried by families or collected by the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive says.

 Spanish club Villarreal will wait until the end of this season to appoint a permanent new manager after deciding to give reserve coach Juan Carlos Garrido the reins on a short-term basis.  The 40-year-old takes over from Ernesto Valverde, who was relieved of his duties following Sunday night's 2-0 home defeat by Osasuna.  Garrido has been appointed despite "The Yellow Submarine" being linked with former Getafe coach Michael Laudrup, with the team 10th in La Liga after last year's impressive fifth placing and having been knocked out of the Copa Del Rey by second division Celta Vigo.  Valverde, who moved to El Madrigal after Manuel Pellegrini joined Real Madrid in June, bid a sad farewell to his players on Monday.  "I've come to say goodbye to the team. It's a different and hard situation for me. The club decided that we wouldn't continue at the helm of Villarreal," he told reporters.  "I came with a lot of excitement because it was the team I wanted to train and it is true that things, from the beginning, did not happen as we all hoped.  "It's certain that we haven't played very well in the past two or three games and that the elimination from the Copa did us a lot of damage and also yesterday the team were bad, and I can only say that the only person responsible is me.  "I am the visible head of the team, the club made a decision and I have to accept it."  Meanwhile, struggling Real Valladolid sacked coach Jose Luis Mendilibar on Monday, making him the seventh managerial casualty of the Spanish top-flight season.  The 48-year-old had kept the club in La Liga for two seasons after a record-breaking promotion-winning campaign, but Sunday night's 1-1 draw with lowly Almeria left his team just one point above the relegation zone.  Reserve-team coach Onesimo Sanchez takes over a team who have won just three times in the last 31 league outings, with the announcement made as Valladolid unveiled new loan signing Asier del Horno.  The 29-year-old former Athletic Bilbao and Chelsea defender, a 10-time Spain international, could make his debut against his parent club Valencia on Saturday.

London His blistering pace and larger-than-life antics made him the king of the track in London, and bolstered his claims to be a "living legend."  Now figures released by Twitter and Facebook have confirmed that Usain Bolt was the most talked about athlete at the Olympics, edging out swimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time.  On Twitter, Bolt's two individual gold medal-winning sprints each generated more discussion than any other moment of Olympic competition.  According to figures released by Andrew Fitzgerald, Twitter's editorial programming manager, Bolt's victory in the 200-meter sprint was the most discussed moment of competition, inspiring a flurry of more than 80,000 tweets per minute,  His earlier performance in the 100 meters was the most talked about Olympic moment on Facebook, and the second most talked about on Twitter, generating 74,000 tweets per minute.  Bolt was a key figure in the fourth most discussed moment of competition on Twitter as well, when the Jamaican 4x100-meter relay team set a world record in their final. The victory to Great Britain's Andy Murray over Roger Federer in the men's tennis final was the third most talked about Olympic moment on Twitter, generating 57,000 tweets per minute.  Bolt was followed by swim star Phelps at the top of Twitter's list of the 10 most talked about athletes, each of whom was mentioned more than a million times on the service.  Read more: London 2012's top 10 moments  The multiple gold medalists were followed by British diver Tom Daley (3), US swimmer Ryan Lochte (4), American gymnast Gabby Douglas (5), Murray (6), US basketball player Kobe Bryant (7), Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake (8), Malaysian badminton player Lee Chong Wei (9) and American basketball player LeBron James (10)  Facebook's line-up was slightly different, but Bolt and Phelps held on to the first and second spots, followed by Douglas (3), Lochte (4), Daley (5), Brazilian soccer player Neymar (6), Murray (7), British athlete Jessica Ennis (8), South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius (9) and American tennis player Serena Williams (10).  Known as the global game, it is little surprise that soccer was the most discussed Olympic event on Twitter: the subject of more than 5 million tweets. Also popular were swimming, track and field, gymnastics, and volleyball.  Read more: London 2012trust the British to get it right  But the spectacles of the opening and closing ceremonies generated even more chatter than any of the sporting events.. Both ceremonies drove large spikes in Twitter conversation, with the biggest generated by the reformed Spice Girls, whose closing ceremony performance prompted more than 116,000 tweets per minute.  But if Boltwhose Twitter biography proclaims himself the "most naturally gifted athlete the world has ever seen"takes umbrage at being temporarily overshadowed by a 90s girl group, he can turn to his Facebook fans for solace. While the Spice Girls, who had their heyday in a world before social media, can muster only 166,000 fans on Facebook, Bolt has more than 8 million of them.  
 More than 8,000 peoplemost of them women and childrenfled into Tunisia during the weekend to escape fighting between Libyan government troops and opposition forces, the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees said Tuesday.  The refugees arriving in Dehiba, in southern Tunisia, are predominantly from ethnic Berber tribes that have long been persecuted by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, a spokesperson for the U.N. aid agency said.  Nearly 40,000 Libyans have fled the country's western mountainous region in the past month as pro-Gadhafi and opposition forces have fought for control of the border crossing point, according to the U.N.  UNHCR staff in Dehiba said the situation of the refugees was being made worse by a violent sandstorm that has battered the area. Hundreds of tents and two huge portable warehouses, set up in an effort to accommodate the exodus, were destroyed.  Opposition forces continue to have control of the border crossing despite fighting that has spilled into Tunisian territory, the agency spokesperson said, adding that UNHCR will give tents to Tunisian authorities, which they can distribute to residents of Dehiba should they need to relocate farther from any further border skirmishes.  Most of the Libyan refugees are arriving in Tunisia in tribal groups. Many are choosing to stay in the camps for a few days before moving on to stay with Tunisian families. UNHCR, and partners, including the World Food Programme and other agencies, are planning to distribute food and relief items to the refugees and their host families.  The situation in Libya has become increasingly precarious for civilians and migrant workers, who have been caught in the crossfire of the conflict that has killed tens of thousands and left thousands more wounded since it began two months ago.  NATO-led forces began bombing regime targets in Libya last month after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians.  More than 550,000 people, mostly migrant workers, have fled Libya for neighboring countries. It has been difficult to track the exact number of Libyans who have fled, because few have claimed asylum, UNHCR has said.  The agency said that there have been more than 8,000 "irregular arrivals" on Italian territory from Libya since March 26. Another 1,132 people have arrived in Malta on boats from Libya since mid-April.

A computer failure temporarily halted the processing of food stamp purchases in parts of the country Saturday.  A system shutdown began at 11 a.m. ET Saturday and affected 17 states, said a spokeswoman for Xeroxwhich is a contractor for the program. By Saturday night, the issue had been resolved.  "We realize that access to these benefits is important to families in the states we serve," said spokeswoman Jennifer Wasmer. "We continue to investigate the cause of the issue so we can take steps to ensure a similar interruption does not re-occur."  The food stamp program, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, allows many beneficiaries to present a payment card at grocery stores. Some of those transactions were being prevented Saturday in unspecified parts of the country.  The program is administered by the Department of Agriculture. The department's public affairs staff has been furloughed and its website was not being updated Saturday because of the partial government shutdown. A phone call to the office of the department's communication director was not answered.  Officials in several states said the computer problem was unrelated to the government shutdown.  CNN affiliate KJRH-TV in Tulsa, Oklahoma, quoted Wasmer as saying the shutdown happened during a test of the company's backup systems.  She said the glitch also affected payments through the Women Infants and Children, or WIC, program.  CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.  
 Vehicles began streaming across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge early Tuesdaya day ahead of scheduleafter the completion of repairs to a crack in the structure's east span.  Commuters make the trek across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge after it reopened Tuesday.  Commuters began driving over the bridge around 6:40 a.m. PT (9:40 a.m. ET), shortly after Randy Iwasaki, director of the California Department of Transportation, announced the reopening at a news conference.  "The bridge has been inspected, and it is safer than when we closed it on Friday," Iwasaki said.  Over the weekend, crews began repairing a "significant crack" that was found on the east span of the bridge during a planned closure for another project.  The target time for reopening had been early Wednesday, but crews worked nonstop overnight to repair the eyebar beam, Iwasaki said. He thanked motorists for being patient.  "I know it's been trying. I received a few e-mail notes," the official said.  Iwasaki said some closures or detours near the bridge would remain in place a while longer, including those along northbound and southbound Interstate 880.  About 280,000 vehicles cross the landmark bridge every day, according to the department.  The Bay Bridge was closed last week as part of a seismic retrofitting project that required cutting out and replacing a double-deck portion of the east span.  Watch as the bridge needed big repairs   A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed in 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake, prompting efforts to make it quake tolerant.

The security chief at One World Trade Center in New York City has stepped down after embarrassing security breaches at the site.  David Velazquez, a former FBI agent, resigned Friday, said Jordan Barowitz, director of external affairs for the Durst Organization. The Durst Organization handles security on the inside of the building and the Port Authority is in charge of the grounds.  A few weeks ago Justin Casquejo, 16, sneaked past security and made his way to the 104th floor of the 1,776-foot building, the tallest in the United States.  On Monday, four men were arrested for a base jumping stunt at the building. Authorities said three men slipped through security September 30 and parachuted from the building while a fourth man stood lookout on the ground.  Velazquez had been with Durst since 2013 and took the top security job in January 2014. Barowitz said the resignation is not immediate. A successor has not been named.  Elizabeth Landers in New York City has contributed to this report.

PRINCETON, New Jersey This week, Jews will conclude the eight-day celebration of Passover, a holiday that has often found its way into the political realm.  Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. frequently invoked the story of the liberation of the Jewish people from the Egyptians in his struggle against white oppression. President Obama made headlines last week when he hosted a Passover Seder in the White House.  Today, Democrats can draw an important lesson from Passover, this time not so much from the story that is retold during the holiday but through the rituals that are the focus of the week. Last Wednesday and Thursday evenings, Jews gathered with families, friends and other groups to have a Seder.  These meals are not just about eating and talking, but also about learning and debating the stories of the holiday contained in a book called the Haggadah. There is no right answer to many of the questions that are raised, and discussions change over time as the life experiences of the participants bring new perspectives to the table.  The highlight of the Seder is when the youngest child asks the Four Questions, asking the adults what makes these nights different from the others and then offering some possible answers.  Politicians could learn a lot from the Seder, particularly when one party controls both the executive and the legislative branch, and the temptation is to act in lock-step. Republicans did not have enough moments of questioning and reflection between 2002 and 2006, which many observers agree was not just damaging to the country but to the party as well.  While there was strong private, internal disagreement among Republicans over how to conduct the war on terror, over whether the war in Iraq was a wise move and over the basic contours of economic policy, most Republicans stayed silent in public.  Even when they gathered in the private corridors of the White House, according to memoirs that have been published by former officials such as Scott McClellan, Republicans tended to remain deferential to President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.  Historically, vigorous internal party debate has had the ability to strengthen a party politically. The fight that took place between Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican primaries, where Reagan pushed President Ford to be more responsive to the growing conservative movement and avoid making all his decisions from inside the beltway, created a GOP that in the 1980s was a formidable political force.  Bill Clinton's insistence that Democrats needed to rethink some of their conventional wisdom from the New Deal and Great Society periods, with his preference being to move toward the center, opened up a healthy debate about what Democrats should stand for that helped result in Barack Obama's victory in 2008.  Thus far, Democrats have been more comfortable openly criticizing each other. Princeton economist Paul Krugman has emerged as the leading liberal critic of the administration by arguing that President Obama is not spending enough to stimulate the economy and that his financial bailout plan will only provide Band-Aid solutions that place all the risk on taxpayers.  But Democrats will feel less comfortable having internal debates as the elections of 2010 and 2012 get closer, as the pressures of re-election intensify and as Republicans become more aggressive and more coherent in their attacks.  To get the conversation started, it would be worth thinking about the four questions that Democrats should keep asking when they get together in the next few years.  The first is: What are the issues on which Democrats are willing to compromise with Republicans, if any?  The compromises will not be easy given that Republicans have refused to endorse Democratic proposals in the first few months of Obama's presidency. However, if the popularity of the GOP continues to erode and Obama's stays strong, there might be an opportunity for the president to act. Compromises means giving something up, so Democrats will have to talk among themselves about what that might be.  The second question is: Where are Democrats willing to renege on campaign promises?  Since November, Democrats have already backed off some very big promises. Though Obama ran as a candidate who promised to change the way that government worked, government reform has quickly dropped off the agenda.  Nor has the White House been fully compliant with its promise to end the secrecy practiced by the Bush administration. It is natural that a party won't be able to do everything it said in a campaign, but Democrats need to think about which issues they are willing to let go and which they are determined to fulfill.  The third question is: What is the foreign policy agenda of the current administration?  This has been the murkiest part of the First 100 Days. When Barack Obama ran for president, it was clear what kind of foreign policy he opposed. His campaign took aim at the unilateralism, militarism and pre-emptive strategy of the Bush administration.  Yet it is easier to be against something than for something. Now the burden is on President Obama to define what he will be about in the next four years and what he hopes to pursue. This agenda will be dynamic and unfold as international crises occur. But Democrats need to keep coming back to the questions and keep forcing the president to articulate what his goals are in this arena.  The final question is: What are the policy priorities of the Democratic Party?  This is always one of the most difficult questions for any party given that events move politics in unexpected directions. This White House has naturally been consumed by the economic freefall and the effort to stabilize economic conditions.  With his budget, Obama has highlighted two priorities from the campaignhealth care and the environment, though some will get traded away in upcoming negotiations. Another issue that the White House may make a priority is immigration reform. Whereas the campaign established a certain framework for thinking about priorities, that framework fades as the election moves farther away.  Democrats must keep getting together, asking their own version of the four questions and insisting on internal debates. Although the discussions can become uncomfortable (as most Jews will recall from their Seders), this is a formula for making the strongest party possible.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.

New York Three members of two popular Iranian indie bands who were living and working in the United States were shot and killed in Brooklyn early Monday by a fellow rocker who then turned the gun on himself, police said.  The dead included Soroush Farazmand, 27, whose rock band the Yellow Dogs was featured in a 2009 CNN report about Iran's burgeoning underground rock scene. Police found the guitarist dead from a shot to the chest in a second-floor bedroom of the East Williamsburg building where band members lived and practiced.  Farazmand's brother, Arash, 28, a drummer with the band the Free Keys who later joined the Yellow Dogs, was also shot and killed at the same location, as was a third Iranian musician, Ali Eskandarian, 35.  An Iranian street artist was shot in the arm, police said.  The shooter, who took his own life on the rooftop of the building, was identified as Ali Akbar Mohammadi Rafie, 29, police said. A spokesman for the Yellow Dogs told CNN that he had been a member of the Free Keys.  Ali Salehezadeh, who handles publicity for the Yellow Dogs, told CNN that a "petty conflict" resulted in a break of communication between the gunman and the band.  New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters that the gunman used a .308-caliber assault rifle, apparently to settle a "dispute ... over money" between the bands. The gunman shot and killed one of the victims through a window before entering the building in the East Williamsburg neighborhood and shooting the others on the second and third floors, Kelly said. Rafie shot himself on the roof after scuffling with at least one of two other people who hid in a bathroom.  In the 2009 CNN story, members of Yellow Dogs described performing in an improvised, clandestine music studio to avoid the wrath of Islamic authorities. The band settled in East Williamsburg after attention generated by the group's contribution to the soundtrack of a film called "No One Knows About Persian Cats," a movie about Iran's underground music scene that won an award at the Cannes Film Festival.  "The law has a problem with rock music so we can't play it," Siavash Karampour, the Yellow Dogs band leader, told CNN in 2009.  Karampour was working at another job at the time of the shooting, Salehezadeh told CNN.  Karampour told CNN that Iranian authorities viewed the band members as "anarchists."  "They're like my brothers," Karampour said of the band members. "They're more close than my brothers."  In the CNN story, Yellow Dog members described their brand of music as rock played with bad equipment and said it touched on subjects ranging from Iranian oppression to American greed.  CNN's Reza Sayah, Nic Robertson and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.  
 Kanye West is paying a price for not ignoring a swarm of paparazzi surrounding him at an airport this past summer.  West's lawyer entered a no contest plea Monday on behalf of the rapper to a misdemeanor count of battery against a photographer.  A no contest plea is treated the same as a guilty plea for purposes of the sentencing.  Judge Alan Rubin sentenced West to serve two years' probation for the misdemeanor battery conviction. He must attend 24 anger management sessions, perform 250 hours of community service and pay restitution to the victim.  Rubin said he will review the community service to make sure he is getting no special treatment.  Photographer Daniel Ramos told the judge he wanted West thrown in jail.  "I was only doing my job, and he broke the law," Ramos said. "I believe that if I did what he did to me, I would have been put behind bars."  The incident was caught on camera, leaving West with the prospect of a tough trial and the possibility of jail unless he accepted a plea deal from prosecutors that included probation.  West was not required to appear in court since the charge was just a misdemeanor.  The video recorded the following exchange:  "Kanye! Kanye! Talk to me, Kanye!" a photographer shouted outside of a Los Angeles International Airport terminal on the night of July 19, 2013.  "Now come on, Kanye, I don't want to fight with you."  "I told you, don't talk to me, right. You're trying to get me in trouble so I step off and have to pay you like $250,000."  West is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands.  West retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer.  "I simply asked him a question, and I didn't use any vulgar language," Ramos told the judge Monday. "In fact, I gave him a compliment and told him that he was cool."  Lawyer Gloria Allred has filed a civil suit against West on behalf of the photographer.  Beverly Hills Police investigated an incident in January in which West was accused of assaulting a man at a Beverly Hills chiropractor's office.  West avoided criminal charges by reaching a civil settlement with the man.  Kim and Kanye's wedding: Save the date  Bonnaroo lineup includes Elton John and Kanye West

SAN FRANCISCO, California  Imagine collecting thousands of empty plastic bottles, lashing them together to make a boat and sailing the thing from California to Australia, a journey of 11,000 miles (17,700 km) through treacherous seas.  This 60-foot sailboat, the Plastiki, is being built from more than 12,000 recycled plastic bottles.  You'd have to be crazy, or trying to make a point. David de Rothschild is trying to make a point.  De Rothschild hopes his one-of-a-kind vessel, now being built on a San Francisco pier, will boost recycling of plastic bottles, which he says are a symbol of global waste. Except for the masts, which are metal, everything on the 60-foot catamaran is made from recycled plastic.  "It's all sail power," he said. "The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere, or into our oceans for that matter, so everything on the boat will be composted. Everything will be recycled. Even the vessel is going to end up being recycled when we finish."  De Rothschild's vessel, scheduled to set sail from San Francisco in April, is called the Plastiki. Its name is an homage of sorts to Thor Heyerdahl, the fabled Norwegian explorer who in 1947 sailed 4,300 miles across the Pacific on the Kon-Tiki, a raft made from balsa wood.  De Rothschild is something of an adventurer himself. The scion of a wealthy British banking family, he is one of only several dozen people to traverse both the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps. In 2005 he founded Adventure Ecology, an organization that uses field expeditions to call attention to environmental issues.  Watch how the boat is constructed   Joining him on the Plastiki will be a permanent crew of three sailors and scientists plus a handful of other crew members who will rotate through the voyage. The Plastiki is expected to stop in Hawaii, Tuvalu and Fiji on its way to Sydney, a trip estimated to take more than 100 days.  The plastic sailboat is taking shape in an old pier building not far from this city's famous Fisherman's Wharf. Here, thousands of two-liter soda bottles are being stripped of their labels, washed, filled with dry-ice powder and then resealed. The dry ice sublimates into carbon dioxide gas and pressurizes the bottle, making it rigid.  The vessel's twin hulls will be filled with 12,000 to 16,000 bottles. Skin-like panels made from recycled PET, a woven plastic fabric, will cover the hulls and a watertight cabin, which sleeps four.  "This actually is the same material that is made out of bottles," said de Rothschild of the PET fabric. "We actually wrap the PET fabric over the PET foam and then basically put it under a vacuum, heat it, press it and create these long PET panels. So that means the boat is, technically, one giant bottle."  Two wind turbines and an array of solar panels will charge a bank of 12-volt batteries, which will power several onboard laptop computers, a GPS and SAT phone.  Only about 10 percent of the Plastiki will be made from new materials, de Rothschild said. He declined to reveal how much it's costing him to build the boat.  "We could potentially put together a boat that costs a fraction of what normal conventional boats are made of," he said. "The idea is to take the Plastiki, break it down [after the voyage], and put it back into the system. So, it may come out being a jacket, a bag, more bottles. It's infinitely recyclable."  The ultimate goal of the Plastiki voyage is not just to encourage people to embrace clean, renewable energy but also to see consumer waste as a potential resource.  That's what this is all aboutshowcasing cradle-to-cradle products rather than cradle-to-grave," de Rothschild said.  Whether the Plastiki will successfully complete its unique journey remains to be seen. But to conservationists concerned about the amount of energy required to manufacture and distribute plastic bottles, its symbolic message is a welcome one.  "Anything that gets in the news and makes people stop and think about plastic can be very helpful," said Betty McLaughlin, executive director of the Container Recycling Institute.  "But it strikes me as a long way to go. I flew from Los Angeles to Australia once, and it took forever. This trip strikes me as kind of dangerous."  
 Rome, Italy In his traditional Christmas message delivered Saturday to crowds braving winter's chill, Pope Benedict XVI urged peace in the Middle East and asked for God's comfort upon beleaguered Christian communities in Iraq and elsewhere in the region.  The annual "To the City and the World address, known in Latin as "Urbi et Orbi," mentioned other global hot spots.  The pope wished for security in places overcome by conflict like Somalia, Sudan's Darfur region, Ivory Coast, Afghanistan and the Korean peninsula and those nations like Haiti that are grappling with the consequences of disease and natural disaster.  "May the light of Christmas shine forth anew in the Land where Jesus was born, and inspire Israelis and Palestinians to strive for a just and peaceful coexistence," Benedict said in the speech delivered in 64 languages, from English and Latin to Maori and Maltese.  "May the comforting message of the coming of Emmanuel ease the pain and bring consolation amid their trials to the beloved Christian communities in Iraq and throughout the Middle East," he said.  Violence targeting Christians in Iraq in recent months forced some Iraqi churches to tone down Christmas observances, even canceling Christmas Mass. Many fear an exodus of Christians from that part of the world.  In his message of hope, Benedict also prayed for the perseverance of Christians in communist China.  "May the birth of the Saviour strengthen the spirit of faith, patience and courage of the faithful of the Church in mainland China, that they may not lose heart through the limitations imposed on their freedom of religion and conscience but, persevering in fidelity to Christ and his Church, may keep alive the flame of hope," he said.  Tens of thousands of people clutched umbrellas under drizzle and rain to hear the 83-year-old pontiff at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City.  "May the birth of the Saviour open horizons of lasting peace and authentic progress for the peoples of Somalia, Darfur and Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast); may it promote political and social stability in Madagascar; may it bring security and respect for human rights in Afghanistan and in Pakistan; may it encourage dialogue between Nicaragua and Costa Rica; and may it advance reconciliation on the Korean peninsula," he said.  This year's Christmas festivities appeared uneventful compared to last year when a woman jumped a barrier and lunged at the pope during Christmas Eve Mass.  Benedict was quickly helped to his feet by his aides and not injured in the incident. The service resumed as the woman was detained by Vatican police and taken to a mental institution.

Qantas Airways' fleet of Airbus A380 aircraft will remain grounded indefinitely after new problems with the planes' engines were uncovered over the weekend, the Australian airline's CEO said Monday.  The fleet was grounded Thursday after one of four engines on one of the airliner's A380s failed in mid-flight, forcing an emergency landing.  Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said Friday that he hoped to have the fleet up in the air within 48 hours after completing engine safety checks, but backed away from that statement Monday, telling Australian Broadcasting Corp., "We did find some issues that we are investigating further."  "Hopefully over the next day or so we will have an understanding of when the aircraft can get back in the air," he added. "Our top priority is making sure that we have the continued safe operation of the aircraft and if this takes a bit longer, it will take longer."  Thursday's incident began shortly after takeoff when the flight carrying 440 passengers and 26 crew members to Sydney, Australia, was forced to return to Singapore's Changi Airport. While above the western Indonesian island of Batam, part  of the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off.  On Friday, Joyce described the incident as an "engine issue" rather than an incident caused by poor maintenance.  He elaborated in his radio interview Monday, saying that on three of the fleet's Rolls-Royce engines "what we found is slight anomalies, oil where it shouldn't be on the engines. And we are just trying to check what could the cause of that be."  "These are new engines on new aircraft and they shouldn't have these issues at this stage and so it has given us an indication of an area for us to focus into," he said.  Rolls-Royce said in a statement last week that it has been working closely with Qantas and air safety authorities "to collect and understand information relating to the event and to determine suitable actions."  Qantas has six A380sthe world's largest airlinersin its fleet of 191 planes. Airbus will at some point deliver 14 more, the airline said.  
 Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release from Taliban captivity was largely celebrated at first.  In the ensuing days, however, several serious issues about death, honor and the law have arisen, and those issues continue to grow.  Is Bergdahl in military trouble?  Any legal issues about Bergdahl, who's been accused of desertion, will be addressed once he has returned to U.S. soil. He's now being treated at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany.  A senior U.S. defense official said this week that Bergdahl has not been classified a deserter and is still scheduled to be promoted to the rank of staff sergeant later this month.  "We have not classified him as a deserter. At this point we do not have any understanding of why he left his camp that night" in June 2009, the official said.  Military officials need to hear Bergdahl's explanation of those events, the official said. He noted that the Army promoted Bergdahl in rank during his captivity.  One expert, Geoffrey Corn, a professor at South Texas College of Law, said the accusations raise "some very serious violations of the uniform code of military justice and arguably violations that led to the loss of life of members of his own unit in their efforts to recover him."  "There's going to be a very deliberate and careful effort to develop the facts, although that also raises complicating issues related to whether or not he is entitled to a Miranda-type warning under the military code, which might lead him to say he doesn't want to talk about it at all," Corn said.  Corn spent 22 years in the Army as an officer and civilian employee, with his last post as the Army's senior law of war expert in the office of the judge advocate general.  Were U.S. soldiers killed searching for Bergdahl?  There is controversy over whether soldiers were killed, directly or indirectly, in the search for Bergdahl after he was taken captive by the Taliban.  Former soldiers involved in the operations to find Bergdahl asserted to CNN this week that at least six soldiers were killed in the search for Bergdahl in 2009. They provided the soldiers' names and their dates of death, with circumstances for some of them.  A day later, Nathan Bradley Bethea, a former member of Bergdahl's battalion who searched for him that summer in 2009, wrote in the Daily Beast that eight soldiers' deaths were tied to the Bergdahl search. Bethea provided the eight soldiers' namesincluding six names that CNN earlier reported.  Pentagon and Army officials have looked at the claims, and "right now there is no evidence to back that up," a U.S. official told CNN on Thursday.  Asked about the accusations, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters Wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find Bergdahl.  Bergdahl's former team leader, former Sgt. Evan Buetow, told CNN, "I can't say for a fact and I don't know if there is really anyone who can prove that soldiers died on a directed mission to find Bergdahl. However every mission, especially in the following two or more months, those were directed missions. Everything after that, they were still missions that were in search of Bergdahl. ... Bergdahl leaving changed the mission."  Bowe Bergdahl: Strong, well-rounded and easy to talk to, friends say  Did Bergdahl desert?  An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded that Bergdahl left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to a U.S. military official briefed on the report. The official spoke to CNN Tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information.  There was no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intentsomething Army officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier. The investigation included interviews with members of Bergdahl's unit, none of whom reported seeing him go, the official said.  It is "unfair" to Bergdahl and his family to presume anything about his motivations for leaving the base, Hagel said Wednesday.  Secretary of the Army John McHugh said Tuesday that "a comprehensive, coordinated" review of Bergdahl's case will be conducted.  The review "will include speaking with Sergeant Bergdahl to better learn from him the circumstances regarding his disappearance and captivity," McHugh said.  Earlier in the week, Hagel declined to address directly detailed questions about Bergdahl's caseparticularly accusations that he deserted, as some of his former brothers-in-arms allege.  Before he went missing, Bergdahl spoke of wanting to get lost in the mountains and walking to India, his comrades said.  "I believe he totally deserted," said former Staff Sgt. Justin Gerleve, Bergdahl's former squad leader.  Opinion: Five tough ethics issues in Bergdahl swap  Did Obama break the law?  Bergdahl's captors freed him in exchange for the release of five Taliban fighters held at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but the Obama administration didn't tell Congress of the releases. Under law, the White House has to give a 30-day notice to Capitol Hill before any terrorists are transferred from Guantanamo.  White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice defended President Obama's decision not to notify Congress.  "Given the acute urgency of the health condition of Sergeant Bergdahl, and given the President's constitutional responsibilities, it was determined that it was necessary and appropriate not to adhere to the 30-day notification requirement, because it would have potentially meant that the opportunity to get Sergeant Bergdahl would have been lost," Rice said.  The president did indeed break the letter of the law, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.  But there are questions about the law itself, he added.  "There's two different questions here. One is, did he violate the federal law? The answer to that is most obviously yes," Turley said. "The second question is whether that law is constitutional. And the answer to that is more difficult.  "This is just a notice requirement. There are thousands of such notice requirements. And the problem with the President's argument is there's no limiting principle, that he could argue that all national security laws could fall into the same unilateral power," Turley said.  Hillary Clinton wanted tougher deal for Bergdahl  Did Bergdahl help the Taliban?  There's no evidence that Bergdahl helped the enemy directly, though he's certainly been used in Taliban propaganda.  What has partly fueled this accusation is how Bergdahl reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing U.S. activities in Afghanistan, according to a 2012 story in Rolling Stone magazine.  Bergdahl's former comrades also wondered if he gave the Taliban intelligence because the enemy executed "very calculated, very methodical" strikes after Bergdahl's disappearance, said Buetow.  But a U.S. official who has been briefed on the initial Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl disappeared told CNN that Bergdahl's commanders referred to him as "a good soldier" in that report.  Some of his teammates said he had expressed "boredom" and thought his unit was too passive and should have been "kicking down doors," the official said.  Taliban video shows Bowe Bergdahl's release in Afghanistan  Was Bergdahl tortured?  It's too early to say how severely Bergdahl was mistreated during his five years of captivity.  Officials have yet to state the findings of their medical examination of Bergdahl following his release Saturday.  A Taliban propaganda video of the handover of Bergdahl showed him looking gaunt and blinking repeatedlyas if in disbelief or shock.  "He doesn't look that bad to me," remarked Chris Voss, a former FBI lead international hostage negotiator, about Bergdahl's condition.  Some experts speculate Bergdahl may have experienced Stockholm syndrome, in which he may have emotionally bonded with his Taliban captors over the five years.  Why is his unit coming out against him?  There's something new and something old motivating the former members of Bergdahl's unit to condemn him.  First there were the immediate reports that Bergdahl was being hailed as a hero. Those accounts incensed the former soldiers.  The comrades also remembered 2009 and how they searched for Bergdahl.  "He walked off," said former Pfc. Jose Baggett, 27, of Chicago. "He left his guard post. Nobody knows if he defected or he's a traitor or he was kidnapped. What I do know is, he was there to protect us, and instead he decided to defer from America and go and do his own thing. I don't know why he decided to do that, but we spent so much of our resources, and some of those resources were soldiers' lives."  In fact, the former soldiers say they are so outraged that they are speaking out publicly at significant peril. The former servicemen said they earlier signed nondisclosure agreements about the disappearance and search for Bergdahl, but they're now violating it.  The six soldiers at center of Bergdahl debate  Is that illegal?  The former soldiers may well be in open violation of that contract.  But they say they will risk punishment.  "It's certainly a possibility, but I don't think that I could have continued to go on without being able to share with you and the people the true things that happened in this situation, because if you guys aren't made aware of it, it will just go on, he will be a hero, and nobody is going to be able to know the truth," said former Army Sgt. Josh Korder, whose back is tattooed with the names of three soldiers who purportedly died while searching for Bergdahl.  Army officials didn't immediately return a CNN request for comment about what consequences, if any, the former soldiers may face if they're in violation of a nondisclosure agreement.  For those former troops, honor is at stake.  "For me, he's a deserter. America needs to know," said Gerleve, the former squad leader. "He's back, and he needs to be held accountable."

In this period of gloomy economic forecasts, Africa's rise has become a widely discussed international policy topic. The sweeping optimism about Africa's economic prospects has been reinforced by 2013 projections that the continent will grow faster than the world average.  The content of the growth, however, has been a source of discomfort among African leaders. They worry that this growth is linked to a commodity boom which is fueled largely by China's demand.  Africa's ability to sustain its current growth will depend largely on how quickly it will be able to shift from reliance on traditional commodity markets to modern economic structures that focus on technology-driven development. The focus on innovation is emerging as a key theme in the Africa Union's long-term strategy, Agenda 2063.  Read this: 10 African tech startups you need to know  The African Union appointed a high-level panel on science, technology and innovation to provide proposals on how the continent can leverage the world's fund of technological knowledge for economic transformation. The panel is chaired by myself and Professor Ismail Serageldin, director of the Library of Alexandria in Egypt.  Building on emerging trends across the continent, the panel's draft report, "On the Wings of Innovation: Africa 2024," makes key recommendations related to harnessing emerging technologies, constructing basic infrastructure, investing in higher technical training, and promoting entrepreneurship.  As a latecomer Africa has the benefit of tapping into vast quantities of technological knowledge available worldwide. The continent's leapfrogging into the mobile revolution illustrated the power of latecomer advantages. Africa is now the origin of new industries such as mobile money transfer. The mobile revolution is still in its infancy and is already being extended to other sectors such as health, education and agriculture.  Biotechnology  Another important area that promises to transform Africa is agricultural biotechnology. To date, only four African countries (South Africa, Burkina Faso, Egypt and Sudan) have adopted transgenic crops. African scientists in additional countries such as Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana are at the forefront of leveraging biotechnology to address local agricultural challenges. They are focusing on problems such as pests, disease, drought and low nutritional content of staple crops.  In addition to technical work, policy makers across the continent are starting to review the laws that govern the same development of biotechnology to create freedom to innovate. This is akin to past efforts to liberalize the telecommunications market to create space for the entry of mobile phones.  Biotechnology is already a multi-billion dollar industry and the associated technical knowledge can be adapted to other sectors, such as health, industry and environment management. The experience gained in adopting mobile technologies and biotechnology will make it easier for Africa to move into other fields, such as nanotechnology and new materials. The debate over biotechnology is therefore a strategic battle to position Africa as a global player in the field of new technologies.  Infrastructure  The draft report focuses on the urgent need to invest in basic infrastructure, such as energy, transportation, irrigation and telecommunications. The World Bank has estimated that the continent will need to invest nearly $93 billion a year in the next decade to meet its infrastructure targets.  African countries are already starting to respond to the challenge. For example, last year South Africa allocated $97 billion to infrastructure projects over the next three years. This magnitude of investment will require considerable creativity that will involve the participation of sectors such as the military. In addition, it offers a new opportunity for building up the much-needed capacity in engineering by creating new research and technical training institutes to support national infrastructure backbones.  Read this: Building roads in Africa? Send in the troops  Training  "On the Wings of Innovation" pays particular attention to the importance of technical training of the youth and recommends the creation of a new generation of universities that combine research, teaching and product commercialization. There is a prototype for universities: The Nelson Mandela Institute of African Science and Technology in Arusha, Tanzania. The institute is located in the Ministry of Telecommunications, Science and Technology.  Africa's technology-based line ministries have a wide range of research and technical institutes that can be upgraded to create a new family of universities that promote innovation for economic development. Their success will also inspire traditional universities to adjust their missions, syllabi and teaching methods to become more relevant to the challenge of human improvement.  Tech entrepreneurs  Finally, the report stresses Africa's need to foster technology-based business incubation. There are two areas that require attention. The first is supporting start-ups. There are good examples of this across Africa, which include initiatives such as iHub in Nairobi and InnovateLagos in Nigeria. The next frontier of policy focus should be scaling up new businesses.  Read this: Tech hub working on 'Nigeria's next big idea'  Flying on the wings of innovation will require long-term vision, policy focus and change-management capacity among African leaders at the continental, national and sub-national levels. Much of the practical action will occur in sub-national regions such as cities, provinces and counties. It will demand smarter governance styles that are supported by evidence rather than political rhetoric.  Creating technology-driven economies will demand greater investment in smart government than is required in the age of extractive industries. Countries that fail to upgrade their governance systems to reflect the competitive challenges of modern global markets will fall by the wayside.

 Amiyrah Martin of Edison, New Jersey, an African-American mom of two, says she and her husband are still trying to figure out how to sit their 8-year-old son down and explain the Trayvon Martin case and its conclusionwithout getting emotional.  "My biggest issue is ... giving him the facts rather than getting upset and giving him how I feel, because I want him to come to his own consensus," the host of the blog Four Hats and Frugal said in an interview. "My husband is the same way. He's very emotional about it ... so he doesn't want him to think, 'Well, Dad feels this way so I should.' He wants him to create his own opinion."  When Martin, who is not related to Trayvon Martin's family, ultimately has the conversation with her little guy, who always "likes to know the why," he'll no doubt ask about race, she said.  "We're going to have to tell him that it may have been due to Trayvon's race, and this is how it happened, and this is how George Zimmerman decided to react to it," she said. "It's going to be very hard to sit him down and have the conversation, but we know we have to do it."  While not everyone agrees that Martin was racially profiled, the case and the protests that followed have led to larger conversations between parents and kids. Some are focusing on raceMartin was black and Zimmerman identifies as Hispanic, so it's not just a black and white issue. Still, others aren't even talking about race but are focusing on behavior.  But when I set out to interview moms about the verdict, and ask what they are telling their kids, I got two very different responses. African-American moms like Amiyrah Martin were extremely willing and interested to talk about their experiences, while very few moms who were not African-American came forward.  Then I saw a post by Liz Gumbinner, a white mom of two and author of the blog Mom-101, which explained a lotthat white moms aren't talking about the story, at least not publicly, and they should be.  "I think that non-African-Americans are talking about it privately, but they are nervous to talk about it publicly, and I think this is an ongoing issue in the U.S., that race is still a topic that people are afraid to discuss unless you're a person of color and you're living it every day," Gumbinner told me.  "It's easy for my friends of color who are mothers to say, 'That could have been my kid and it feels personal,' and it's easier for them to speak out and take action the way I think so many white people did with Sandy Hook, for example'That could have been my kid,'" she added. "What's important is for us to remember is that it could have been any of our kids, skin color aside, and so there are so many layered issues that we have to have these conversations."  Gumbinner says she hasn't talked with her girls, ages 6 and 8, about the Trayvon Martin case, but if her 8-year-old hears about it, she'll discuss it with her. "I'd rather talk about the macro issue with her, about treating people with respect and not judging people based on how they look, than get into the details of a murder case. She is still very young."  One mom's message to her kids  While some parents may approach the topic from the viewpoint that Martin was more likely to be treated differently because he was African-American, other parents are using the case as a behavioral lesson and leaving race aside.  Catherine Martines Mortensen, a mom of two in Fairfax, Virginia, watched a lot of the trial with her 15-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son, and discussed the verdict when it was handed down. "I told my kids both people used really poor judgment," she said during an interview. "They had assumptions about the other, even without knowing the situation. Neither one of them should have engaged. They should have left."  "I told my kids, if they are ever in a situation where they don't know if someone's following them or what's going on, they just need to get home. Don't linger around," she said.  As they watched the trial, she said her kids were constantly trying to figure out who was right and who was wrong. "My kids would go back and forth. One would say, 'Well, Trayvon, it was his fault because he started the fight.' The other one would have said, 'Well, Zimmerman, he should have never gotten out of the car.' I think it was never clear-cut."  "A lot of times children's brains will try to process information in a very black and white way, but in this case, they couldn't do that," she said.  Comforting a brother who doesn't understand  Cindy Rodriguez, editor for Latino audiences at CNN.com, went to pick up her 14-year-old brother for a movie outing Sunday, a day after the verdict was announced. Her brother carried a hoodie over his arm. His father told him not to put it on until they got inside the movie theater. Her brother didn't understand, and told Rodriguez their dad said it's because of "that kid that died."  "He didn't have a gun on him, right? So why would that other guy shoot him?" her little brother asked. When she told him about the "stand your ground" law in Florida, her brother responded that Trayvon Martin was "so small."  "Every question that seems so obvious to everyone that's so shocked by the verdict, I see it in my little brother's eyes," she told me. "He said, 'I just don't get it. ... Why would they have that law?' "  Rodriguez said she has steered away from talking about race with her brother, saying she was always raised to believe she is the same as everyone else. But after the Trayvon Martin case, she felt she needed to talk with her brother about it. "We kind of live in a world where the minority teenager with the hoodie on means trouble, and unfortunately that's kind of the way things are going now," she told her brother.  She told him he might not encounter racism now because he lives in a predominantly Hispanic community, but that when he leaves his neighborhood in North Bergen, New Jersey, that could change. "People are going to approach you differently," she told him, giving a big-sister message she really wishes she'd never had to give.  Conflicted about whether to have the conversation  Marie Stroughter, an African-American mother with three children, including a 15-year-old son, said she and her husband are having "deep" conversations about whether they should talk with their kids about the case and the reactions to the verdict.  "I think our fear is we've raised them as much as possible in this society to be pretty much colorblind," the co-creator of the blog African-American Conservatives told me during an interview. "I mean, they are aware of their own heritage, but our fear is injecting thoughts into them that they don't necessarily need to have. Do we want them to view people with suspicion that don't need to be viewed with suspicion?"  Stroughter worries that by telling her children to watch out for discrimination from certain people, they'll end up doing the very thing she wants them to avoidracially profiling others.  While she tries to figure out what to do, she says she and her husband will continue to rely on their strong Christian faith. "The only thing we can think of is to teach them Christian values that are colorblind," she added.  Mom guilt  Amiyrah Martin showcased a picture of her son on a post titled "This is My Boy," in which she confessed to feeling something else after the Travyon Martin verdictmom guilt.  "I do feel a little bit of guilt because I did bring him into this world, him and his sister, and they're going to have a lot of adversity still to comeso should I have thought about that before I brought them into this world? Is it fair that I did that to them? And that's been in the back of my mind quite a bit since it happened," she told me.  When Martin ultimately has the talk with her son, I don't know if she'll share that she's feeling some mom guilt. Maybe if we'd all start talking about race in all of our householdsnot just the ones headed by African-Americansmoms like Martin wouldn't have anything to feel guilty about.

	 'Calestous Juma: The 8-year-old son of Trayvon Martin'
The brother of skater Nancy Kerrigan, charged with assault and battery in an incident involving his father, was released on bond, authorities said Wednesday.  Mark Kerrigan posted the previously set $10,000 bail and was released from custody, according to the Woburn District Court Clerk's office in Massachusetts.  Kerrigan, 45, was fitted with a tracking device and under conditions of his release is not allowed to leave his home other than to visit his attorney, the clerk's office said. He also is forbidden to use any drugs or alcohol other than prescription medication, can have no access to weapons and must have mental health counseling.  "The Kerrigan family is delighted to have Mark back with them," family spokeswoman Nancy Sterling said in a statement. "They ask that you respect their privacy as they welcome Mark home."  He was arraigned in January and pleaded not guilty to charges he assaulted his father, Daniel Kerrigan, 70. The elder Kerrigan died January 24 after an alleged altercation with his 45-year-old son at the family's home in Stoneham, Massachusetts.  Mark Kerrigan, through his attorney, has denied any responsibility in his father's death.  Daniel Kerrigan's death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner, but Middlesex County prosecutors have not said whether other charges might be filed against the younger Kerrigan in light of the finding.  The Kerrigan family has said, in a statement released through their attorney, that they believe the medical examiner's finding to be "premature and inaccurate."  "The Kerrigan family does not blame anyone for the unfortunate death of Dan Kerrigan, who had a pre-existing heart condition," said the family statement, released by attorney Tracy Miner.  According to Middlesex County Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Keeley, police responded to a 911 call at approximately 1:30 a.m. January 24 from Brenda Kerrigan, wife of Daniel and mother to Mark and Nancy Kerrigan.  Keeley told District Court Judge Mark Sullivan during the arraignment for Mark Kerrigan that there was a violent argument and struggle between the father and his son, resulting in the elder Kerrigan falling or collapsing on the kitchen floor. Keeley said that Mark Kerrigan told authorities "that he did in fact have an argument with his father, the argument became physical, he grabbed his father around the neck, and at some point the father collapsed to the floor."  According to Keeley, police found Mark Kerrigan in the basement of the house, "clearly intoxicated" and "extremely combative." He refused to comply with police officers, said Keeley, and they had to subdue him with pepper spray before forcibly removing him from the home.  Mark Kerrigan's attorney, Denise Moore, said in court that Kerrigan was unemployed, was recently released from a correctional facility and was living at home with his parents. He is taking medications and seeking psychological help for post-traumatic stress, apparently from his time in the Army, she added.  Nancy Kerrigan first gained prominence by winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. In 1994 she earned an Olympic silver medal in Lillehammer, Norway.  She is perhaps best remembered for surviving an attack before the 1994 Winter Games by skating rival Tonya Harding's ex-husband and an accomplice.  CNN's Bob Crowley, Evan Buxbaum and Vanessa Juarez contributed to this report.  
 Even before her 18th birthday, Maria had already been enslaved by a gang of human traffickers and held in captivity for four months in her homeland of Mexico.  While a prisoner, Maria witnessed a sickening trade in human life and recalls how young girls were drugged, forced into prostitution and then murdered.  What makes Maria's story so special is that she was one of the lucky ones who were able to escape.  Maria, whose real name we aren't using, used to live in the border town of Ciudad Juarez.  The city is home to two drug cartels that fight a bloody turf war for lucrative smuggling routes to America.  In a four-day period, 41 people were murdered, while over the past decade, 450 women were killed and 3,000 went missing.  "Today girls are still going missing but their bodies are never found," Miguel Perea, a local journalist told Britain's Channel 4.  "There's no trace of them and their mothers and families of these girlsthey haven't got a clue what's happened to them."  Maria described how at the age of 16 she was lured off the streets by a young man who promised the world, but delivered nothing but pain.  She was raped, drugged and sold for sex. "They took a gallon of gasoline and started pouring it over a girl," Maria said.  "One of the men told me if you don't do as I say I will do the same to you.  "I wanted to look away, but they didn't let me. Even though the girl was on fire they kept hitting her and they were laughing as if they were enjoying what they were doing."  Maria described a cross-border trade in young children and babieswith orders coming in regularly from the U.S.  "They stole the children and one of the gang members took a six-year-old kid that I had to look after for three hours.  "He told me he wanted to see his mummy then I started crying and said 'I don't think you're ever going to see your mummy again.'"  The claims that Maria made were so serious that she was asked by the Department of Homeland Security to come to the U.S. to tell her story.  Mexican authorities accompanied Maria on her trip to Houston to work alongside U.S. authorities on the case.  The U.S. State Department estimates that more than 20,000 people are trafficked into the U.S. each yearmainly destined for the sex trade.  Authorities have launched an immediate investigation into Maria's story.  "I want to tell the story so that in the near future, other girls don't go through the same," Maria said.  "Women are sold, they are abducted, bought and even killed by these men.  "If these men are ever found, jail won't be enough to make them pay for the way they've made us feel."

A controversial Rolling Stone article began a heated conversation about rape on college campus after a student the magazine called "Jackie" described being gang raped at a University of Virginia fraternity.  Now some advocates worry where that conversation is headed after the magazine flagged possible flaws in the article.  "I've had a lot of our members, especially sexual assault survivors, emailing me, asking if this is going to distract from the broader, bigger problem of sexual assault on campus," said Monika Johnson-Hostler, president of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. "They're worried that fallout from one story is going to give people a reason to believe campus sexual assault isn't a real problem or it's been overhyped."  One in five women are sexually assaulted during college, according to a White House task force report issued this summer.  Last month, Rolling Stone published Jackie's story, a harrowing retelling of how she was allegedly raped by seven men at a Phi Kappa Psi party in 2012. The article sparked international outrage and placed the University of Virginia in the spotlight on the issue of campus sexual assault.  Students protested, and university officials banned Greek activities for the semester and vowed change.  Then The Washington Post identified holes in the story. Also on Friday, Rolling Stone posted an apology on its website. Editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on Jackie, nor did the magazine attempt to contact any of the men Jackie claimed participated in the attack for fear that that could bring retaliation against the college student.  Editors regretted that, the note said.  The note went a step further, saying: "In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced."  A day later, Rolling Stone amended that note. It removed the reference to trust being misplaced and added this: "These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie." The magazine offered no explanation for the update.  Victim blaming?  Rolling Stone has been accused of victim blaming when it said that its trust in Jackie was "misplaced."  On CNN's "Reliable Sources," writer Hanna Rosin spoke about the peril of focusing blame on Jackie.  Rolling Stone's initial apology that said its trust in Jackie was misplaced "essentially said this is Jackie's fault but, you know, Jackie is not a journalist," Rosin said. "She doesn't know the rules of journalism. She's just telling her own story. It's on us to know that you have to trust but verify. You have to check the sources. You have to figure out with the story is true because if not you end up in a mess like the one we're in now."  Johnson-Hostler said that by focusing on the telling of one survivor's story, it can have the unintended consequence of holding that experience as the "true" rape experience. "It can imply to a survivor, 'Well, my experience wasn't as bad as that one, so maybe I wasn't raped,' " said she said.  Would all of that actually make it less likely survivors might come forward?  "A survivor will see the way this young woman in the Rolling Stone article is being attacked from all sidesfrom the media, from the school, from the Greek systemand think it's not worth coming forward," said John Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor who was an assistant dean at UVA from 1998 to 2002. He has devoted much of his career researching sexual assault in college and military culture.  Are discrepancies really that?  Foubert says the "noise" around the Rolling Stone editors' apology will probably mean survivors are going to be less willing to share their stories with journalists.  Some advocates feel that keeping those stories in the dark only makes survivors feel more alone and it takes away from the public's education about preventing and reporting sexual assault.  As far as perceived discrepancies in Jackie's story, Foubert said that could simply be symptom of the trauma she endured. "Someone who experiences such extreme stress will talk and remember the stress in different ways at different times, through each telling. The assumption is that it didn't happen or she's lying."  That is not in line with the way post traumatic stress presents itself, he said.  University of Virginia English professor Susan Fraiman also worries that the attention paid to the Rolling Stone story will detract from the bigger picture at the school.  "There's a broader desire to make sure that adjudication of rape cases are handled fair," she told CNN.  Even after the Rolling Stone article published, there was more fallout from UVA regarding campus sexual assaults.  Associate Dean of Students Nicole Eramo, who guides women through their options when they report they've been assaulted, recently told WUVA that no student had been expelled for committing sexual assault, even when the accused admitted it.  Eramo told WUVA that there had been 38 reports of sexual assault last year.  
 Former U.S. Marine Cesar Laurean was convicted in North Carolina on Monday of first degree murder in the 2007 death of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach, who was eight months pregnant when she died.  An autopsy showed that Lauterbach, 20, died of blunt force trauma to the head. Police unearthed her charred body from beneath a barbecue pit in Laurean's backyard in January 2008. She had disappeared the month before.  Laurean, who was dressed in black slacks and wore a white shirt and black tie, did not show any emotion as the judge read his sentence of life in prison without parole. He either said or mouthed something to someone in the audience of the courtroom before he was led out in handcuffs, video showed.  Laurean and Lauterbach were stationed together at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  "I truly believe that Maria was the perfect victim. Because of her credibility problems, our pleas for help [after her disappearance] were rejected or discounted by everyone," Mary Lauterbach, the victim's mother, said after the verdict was read, CNN affiliate WRAL reported.  North Carolina prosecutors alleged Laurean killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico. Laurean was arrested there in April 2008. He holds dual citizenship in the United States and Mexico.  Before her death, Lauterbach told the Marines that Laurean had raped her. Laurean denied it, and disappeared just a few weeks before a scheduled rape hearing at Camp LeJeune. WRAL reported Lauterbach later recanted the allegation of rape.  The DNA of Lauterbach's unborn child did not match that of Laurean, according to law enforcement personnel.  Onslow County Chief Assistant District Attorney Ernie Lee said in his closing argument that Laurean needed to kill Lauterbach to salvage his military career, WRAL reported.  "I can get rid of my problem," Lee said to explain what Laurean might have been thinking, reported WRAL.  Authorities found Lauterbach's body after Laurean's wife, Christina, produced a note her husband had written claiming the 20-year-old woman slit her own throat during an argument, according to officials.  Although a gaping 4-inch wound was found on the left side of Lauterbach's neck, autopsy results indicated that the wound itself would not have been fatal and may have occurred after death.  "It is a just result, but still a tragedy with no winners," Merle Wilberding, a lawyer who represented the Lauterbach family, wrote in an e-mail to CNN after the verdict.  Laurean's lawyer said his client would appeal the decision.  CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.

Cross-country skiing is less speedyand therefore less intimidatingthan its steep-sloped cousin, downhill skiing. It also burns more calories, as skiers glide along snowy trails and skate up inclines.  Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are $21 for adultsbut ask about specials.  So, for those of you trying to stay true to your 2009 resolutions, the sport may be the perfect way to get more exercise and take in a dose of nature in the process.  CNN asked Ron Bergin, publisher of Cross Country Skier magazine, to recommend five places to hit the horizontal slopes.  Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, Lake Tahoe, California  The area around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the border between California and Nevada, is ripe with cross-country skiing opportunities.  So much so, said Kevin Murnane, general manager of the Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, that "you can spend a whole week here and ski at a different area every day."  Bergin said the lakeside scenery is top-notch, as is the skier culture. You likely will find buddies who will share trail stories and a drink after a long day on the trails.  Murnane's ski area allows dogs on some trails and offers free lessons to help learners adjust to the balance-intensive sport.  Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are $21 for adults, but ask about specials. On Tuesdays, passes run $12. Groups and early-morning skiers also get a discount.  Trapp Family Lodge, Stowe, Vermont  Owned by descendants of Maria von Trappyes, that Trapp family, whose life inspired "The Sound of Music"the Trapp Family Lodge brings a little piece of Austria's lively hills to the mountains of Vermont.  Johannes von Trapp, the real Maria's youngest son, helped open the lodge in 1968. The family had been in the lodging business before the musical film starring Julie Andrews debuted in 1965.  For Bergin, the history itself is a draw. So is the fact that the luxury lodge, which still pulls off a quaint charm, is dedicated to cross-country skiing.  "It's beautiful. It backs up to the mountains and you've got a great view of a lot of trails," Bergin said.  The lodge offers a range of promotions, from wine-and-dine packages to those geared toward "winter wellness."  The lodge offers rooms and chalets ranging from $275 to $475 per night. Go for the two-night package and you'll get ski rentals, breakfast, dinner and lodging for both days for $500 per person.  Methow Valley, Winthrop, Washington  Northeast of Seattle in the Cascade Mountains, nearly 125 miles of ski trails connect the villages of Methow Valley. It's almost as if cross-country skiing becomes a form of transportation in and around the area, Bergin said.  While the linear path is "not a typical layout" compared to most cross-country loops, Bergin said the trails offer a sense of adventure and exploration.  At one end, you'll find The Sun Mountain Lodge, which is the area's luxurious gem. But the valley also has hangouts for the Bohemian traveler: The Old Schoolhouse Brewery sells $4 pints in a smart red building and the local food cooperative offers organic smoothies and sandwiches.  Trail passes run $20 for adults and $10 for teens ages 13 to 17.  Stokely Creek Lodge, Goulais River, Ontario, Canada  Located in Ontario, Canada, north of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, this remote lodge gives skiers a serene escape from the bustle of everyday life.  "You ski away from the lodge and immediately you feel like you're out in the wilderness," Bergin said. "All of a sudden, you're just transported from the day-to-day."  The natural scenerymore than 12 square miles of itis varied and always exciting, he said. Around some curves, skiers will find a cold creek. Other areas are known for hills or lakes that seem like they're in the middle of nowhere.  The lodge offers $15 day passes for groups of ten or more; kids 18 and younger pay $10 and adult passes are $18. For the full treatment, though, two adults can stay the night at rates ranging from $98 to $170. That includes two ski passes and three meals, which, according to lodge manager Jamie Martin, are almost as big a hit as the skiing. The kitchen serves highbrow treats like filet mignon and Cornish hen, he said.  Cable Area, Cable, Wisconsin  Northern Wisconsin is proof that you don't need huge mountains for good skiing.  The Cable Areawhich includes the towns of Cable, Drummond, Namakagon and Grand Viewboasts one of the world's biggest cross-country ski races and is regarded by some as the birthplace for the sport in North America, Bergin said.  Bergin, who lives in the area, called the Cable Area the "Mecca" for cross-country skiing in the region.  "Within the radius of an hour's drive, you could probably find 30 or 40 trail systems of all sizes and shapes," he said. "There's quite a skiing culture."  The Telemark Resort offers trail passes that are cheaper than most: $11 per day. Lodging at the resort ranges from $79 for a room in the lodge to $275 for a 1,000-square-foot condo, said Darrell Buchmann, the resort's general manager.  
 ATLANTA, Georgia  Three former Atlanta police officers were sentenced Tuesday to prison terms ranging from five to 10 years for covering up a botched drug raid in which a 92-year-old woman was killed.  Kathryn Johnston was shot five times in a botched drug raid on her Atlanta home two years ago.  Jason Smith was sentenced to 10 years in the November 2006 raid that left Kathryn Johnston dead in a hail of bullets. Former officers Greg Junnier and Arthur Tesler were sentenced to six and five years, respectively, said Patrick Crosby, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Georgia.  Investigators determined the raid at Johnston's home was based on falsified paperwork stating that illegal drugs were present. The incident prompted a major overhaul of the Atlanta Police Department's drug unit.  "Officers who think, as these defendants once did, that the ends justify the means or that 'taking shortcuts' and telling lies will not be discovered and punished should realize that they are risking their careers and their liberty." U.S. Attorney David Nahmias said in a written statement.  "Officers who try to obstruct justice when their misconduct faces exposure, rather than cooperating in the investigation, should realize that they will face even more severe punishment."  All three men pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death. Smith and Junnier also pleaded guilty to state charges of voluntary manslaughter and making false statements, and Smith admitted to planting bags of marijuana in Johnston's home after her death.  U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes ordered all three men to serve three years of supervised release after their prison terms, and to split Johnston's funeral costs, which totaled $8,180, authorities said.  On Monday, Junnier broke down on the witness stand during a sentencing hearing, WXIA reported, saying, "I used to think I was a good person."  Smith said, "I pray daily for Ms. Johnston. I also pray other officers in Atlanta will have the moral fortitude I didn't have," according to WXIA.  Tesler was convicted on one state count of making false statements after filling out an affidavit saying that an informant had purchased crack cocaine at Johnston's home in a crime-plagued neighborhood near downtown Atlanta.  The informant, however, denied ever having been to Johnston's home, leading to probes by local and federal authorities as well as the breakup and reorganization of the Atlanta police narcotics unit.  The raid occurred as police were executing a so-called "no-knock" search warrant based on the faulty information. Police said Johnston fired at them with an old pistol during the raid, and they returned fire in self-defense. Johnston's one shot went through her front door and over the officers' heads; they responded with 39 shots, hitting the elderly woman five times.  Tesler's state conviction was reversed on appeal, but he pleaded guilty to the federal charge. Junnier and Smith face sentencing March 5 on state charges including voluntary manslaughter, but according to their plea agreement, their sentence will be served at the same time as the federal sentence, authorities said.  Shortly after the federal probe began, however, Junnier began cooperating with authorities, providing "valuable assistance in the investigation and prosecution of Smith and Tesler," according to the statement issued by Nahmias' office. Smith also cooperated "to a more limited extent," the statement said, adding that both Junnier and Smith's sentences were reduced because of their cooperation.  Prosecutors have said that the officers regularly presented false information to obtain warrants and that they cut corners to make more time for lucrative side jobs providing additional security to businesses, often while on duty, and receiving cash payments.  "As Atlanta police narcotics officers, these three defendants repeatedly failed to follow proper procedures and then lied under oath to obtain search warrants," Nahmias said. "Their routine violations of the Fourth Amendment led to the death of an innocent citizen."  The investigation into the raid at Johnston's home also led to guilty pleas from the police sergeant in charge of the narcotics unit and another officer who admitted to extortion, prosecutors said.

Toronto Describing Canada's terrorism activity as "diverse and constantly evolving," the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Tuesday charged three Ottawa men with terrorism-related offenses.  Awso Peshdary, 25; John Maguire, 24; and Khadar Khalib, 23, were charged with conspiracy to facilitate a terrorist act, knowingly participating in the activities of a terror group and counseling a person to knowingly participate in a terrorist activity.  Maguire and Khalib are believed to be fighting with ISIS in Syria or Iraq and were charged in absentia.  Peshdary was arrested in Ottawa on Tuesday without incident.  Maguire has been a menacing presence on social media, seen in videos threatening Canada and its allies and boasting of ISIS strength.  Posts on social media in recent weeks have claimed that Maguire died while fighting with ISIS, but Canadian authorities say they have no proof that Maguire on whether he's dead or alive.  "Through collaborative efforts with our partners, we were able to disrupt an organized network associated with (ISIS). This network was involved in recruiting individuals for terrorism purposes and in sending them into Syria and Iraq for the benefit of this terrorist group," said James Malizia, an assistant RCMP commissioner, in a statement.  The arrests Tuesday were part of yet another extensive national security criminal investigation, this one named "Project Servant." It involved the RCMP as well as local and provincial police.  Including those charged Tuesday, Canadian police have now charged six Ottawa men in recent weeks with terrorism related offenses. They say all knew each other and were communicating through social media. It is unclear whether they were part of one cell or operating more loosely.  "These charges along with other terrorism-related arrests within the past few weeks underscore the reality that there are individuals in Canada who become radicalized to violence and who are willing to act upon it,"  said Malizia during a news conference in Ottawa.  
 What happens when you give a 2-year-old a camera? For Toronto toddler Henry Shakyaver, his imagination runs wild in a good way.  Portrait and wedding photographer Alex Neary has been Henry's nanny for the past year and a half. One day, during a visit to the park, they were sitting in a sandbox and Henry leaned over a toy dump truck.  '"Take a photo of me like this," Neary recalls him saying.  Then he asked her to mimic his pose and let him take her photo. She showed him how to hold her iPhone and push the shutter button.  The results were delightful, if not a little blurry. Neary started compiling the images on her website in a photos series Henry's Concepts that's catching the attention of blogs and local media.  Neary has been photographing Henry since she became his nanny, so his mother wasn't surprised to see him show an interest in getting behind the camera.  "The irony is that he won't sit still to take a picture for me," Lorri MacDonald said.  McDonald thinks the project teaches her son observation skills and inspires him to be creative.  "He's learning to see the world through a different lens. I think he's aware of his surroundings more through this project," MacDonald said.  Neary has also learned a thing or two from the project, which continues on her site. She shared with CNN some wisdom and tips for teaching children photography skills. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.  CNN: What are some of Henry's interests?  Neary: He loves dinosaurs. We go to the museum a lot. The aquarium; he loves underwater life. He loves trucks, trains and building ramps. He's a really hands-on, energetic kid.  CNN: I'm amazed these are all shot with an iPhone.  Neary: With the iPhone, doing indoor shots with him is tough. I'm trying to teach him how to focus, but he doesn't quite get that. Some of the photos are blurry and not quite right.  I don't know if I'd be able to do this if it were a real camera. But because it's an iPhone, it's so light and small enough for his tiny little hands to hold. He can hold it and slide his thumb over to take a photo.  CNN: How many times does it take to get a picture before turns out?  Neary: Sometimes he gets it on the first go. Sometimes it takes three or four times. Usually I get in a pose, then he takes the photo, then I have to take a look to see if he got the shot. If he didn't get it, I'll get back in the pose and we'll try again. Sometimes he only gets my legs in it, or my head and sometimes his thumb is over it.  CNN: What has Henry learned in doing this project with you?  Neary: I don't know if he's learned anything really, but he's taking interest in taking photos of other things in the location that we're in. I think it's starting to bring out an interest in photography. I don't know if he'll grow up to be a photographer, but I think he'll definitely do something creative.  CNN: What are your tips for other parents or people who want to try having their kids take photos?  Neary: If they show an interest in it, and you feel comfortable and safe with them using the camera or phone, teach them the basic skills, like this is the button to push. When you see what you like in the screen, tap the icon. I think it's more about getting them to have an interest in photography and having them interested in seeing things with a photographic eye.  Be game for what they throw at you. Kids have crazy imaginations. You just have to be ready for whatever they throw at you. Be ready to laugh at yourself and make a fool out of yourself.  CNN: What has Henry taught you through this project?  Neary: The poses he chooses, I would never make my clients do that. More than anything it's just brought me a lot of happiness. There's really no age limit to photography and creativity. If you have a creative mind at such a young age, then just embrace it and try to bring it out. Just let him do his thing.  He's starting to get really smart with this. I was getting him ready for his nap and he said, "How about before nap time we do seven different poses?" He's using the posing as a way to stall things that he just really doesn't want to do.  Related: Meet Fuji, the 3-year-old photographer

How will the Dreamliner get back in the air? The answers lie in a dense federal document posted online Thursday.  The Federal Aviation Administration's Airworthiness Directive for Boeing's 787-8 was posted online Thursday and goes into effect upon publication Friday in the Federal Register.  The directive outlines the modifications necessary for the much-anticipated Dreamliner to fly again after faulty battery systems grounded the aircraft earlier this year.  The FAA stated that any 787's return to service would only take place after the agency monitors modifications of the aircraft in the U.S. fleet and inspects the work.  United plans to resume 787 service in May  "An FAA inspector will have to accept the work before the airplane technically is in compliance with the (directive)," said FAA spokesman Les Dorr.  Nearly 50 already-delivered Dreamliners have been grounded for more than three months, after two incidents on jets operated by Japanese airlines called the battery systems into question. The Dreamliner's use of lightweight composite materials to greatly improve fuel economy has made it a big seller in Asia and the Middle East, where long-haul flights account for much of an airline's business.  United Airlines, which has six Boeing 787 aircraft, is the only U.S. airline to take delivery of the Dreamliner so far. It will cost the airline about $2.8 million to implement the fix, according to the FAA's Federal Register filing.  Calling the FAA plan "a good step forward," United spokeswoman Christen David said the company is developing "a return-to-service plan, and we look forward to getting our 787s back in the air."  The company plans to begin domestic flights using the 787 in May and possibly launch the Denver-Narita (Japan) route on June 10.  Airline quality report sorts out duds from the dynamos  Boeing is sending special teams to assist in the repairs, according to Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel.  "The FAA's publication of the Airworthiness Directive is an important step forward in returning the 787 fleet to flight status," Birtel said in an e-mail.  The directive requires that 787 operators install "main battery and auxiliary power unit battery enclosures (APU) and environmental control system (ECS) ducts; and replacing the main battery, the APU battery and their respective battery chargers."  "Once modifications are completed on individual airplanes, our customers will determine, with their regulatory authorities, when to return their 787s to service," said Birtel.  Although the FAA's fix only applies to U.S. carriers, it's likely other foreign civil aviation authorities will consider the U.S. agency's plan, said the FAA's Dorr.  Boeing has already started installing the modified battery system on 10 aircraft in service and nine aircraft in production, said Boeing CEO Jim McNerney during Boeing's earnings call Wednesday.  "We expect to complete the bulk of fleet retrofits by mid-May," said McNerney, according to a transcript of the call.  McNerney said Boeing expects to resume Dreamliner deliveries in early May.  CNN's Mike Ahlers, Jennifer Liberto and Marnie Hunter contributed to this story.  
 The main road connecting the Syrian capital of Damascus with the city's airport was open, but no flights were operating Friday, according to an opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Fighting between rebels and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad disrupted much of the capital, and there was no Internet service throughout much of Syria for a second day.  Fighting killed another 106 people across the country, according to an opposition group that counts casualties.  Government forces and rebels battled in towns near the airport, which was closed on Thursday, the opposition group said. The possibility it could fall to rebel forces would be a significant development in the nearly two-year conflict.  Rebel control of the airport "would have a psychological effect" on the government and people who live in Damascus who support the regime, said retired U.S. Army Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a former top military aide to former President George W. Bush.  "The civilians in Damascus will feel cut off from the outside world," Kimmitt said.  State run media blamed the violence on "terrorists."  Al-Assad loyalists and members of the Alawite minority (the al-Assads are Alawites) might flee to neighboring countries, while others could take up arms to defend al-Assad.  As the rebels worked on gaining ground at the airport, they told CNN on Friday that they had pushed al-Assad's forces from the al-Omar oilfield in the city of Deir Ezzor, which is in an oil-rich region. They have been battling Syrian forces there for weeks.  Al-Assad's forces remain in control of five major oilfields in Deir Ezzor, the opposition said. Those killed on Friday including six people in Aleppo and two in Damascus, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria.  CNN could not confirm government or opposition claims about violence and casualties as Syria has severely restricted access for journalists.  A Syrian government information minister said that "terrorists"which is how the Assad government refers to rebelscut the Internet service.  But Matthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare, a leading Web security firm, said the government is almost certainly responsible because of the outage pattern.  Rebels have routinely used the Web to transmit images of the civil war.  The uprising in Syria began in March 2011, largely inspired by Arab Spring protests that toppled hardline regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. Al-Assad's government responded by arresting, beating and shooting protesters, experts and witnesses said.  The crackdown ignited a vicious armed conflict that has killed more than 40,000 civilians, according to the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria.  More than 380,000 Syrians have fled the violence, the United Nations reports, to become refugees in neighboring countries such as Turkey and Lebanon.  CNN's Chelsea J. Carter and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.

New Delhi An Indian court has ruled that the organizer of the scandal-plagued 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi is forbidden from attending the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.  The presence at the ceremony of Suresh Kalmadi, who was arrested last year on corruption charges related to the Commonwealth Games, would be "contrary to national interest," the High Court of Delhi said Wednesday.  The legal action seeking to restrict Kalmadi's movements was filed after a different court had authorized him to travel to London. He had sought permission for the trip in order to attend meetings of the International Association of Athletics Federations.  The Delhi high court allowed him to go ahead with his visit. But it said he couldn't leave India until Friday, the day of the opening ceremony, and should honor a pledge not to attend any Olympic events "in any official capacity."  Kalmadi still holds a number of high-profile sports administrative roles, including the presidency of the Indian Olympic Association.  In a statement, he said he was "never planning to attend" the opening ceremony and had never sought permission to do so.  The petitioner who brought the litigation, Rahul Mehra, said Kalmadi's presence at the Olympics would be "extremely embarrassing" for the athletes and India. Mehra described himself as a "patriotic citizen of the country."  The Indian government also is not in favor of Kalmadi attending the Olympics while he still faces corruption charges, according to the text of the high court's judgment.  The 2010 Commonwealth Games, which India had hoped would burnish its image as a rising economic power, was marred by accusations of graft, missed construction deadlines and cost overruns.  An Indian court granted bail to Kalmadi in January after he had spent nine months in jail following his arrest. The police detained him over allegations that as the head of the games' organizing committee, he bought a time, scoring and result system from a Swiss company at an inflated price.  Kalmadi is also a lawmaker in the Indian parliament, where he represents the governing Congress party.  Corruption has plagued India for years. A series of high-profile scandals rocked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's administration in its second term, as well as investor confidence in Asia's third-largest economy.  Sumnima Udas reported from New Delhi; Jethro Mullen reported from Hong Kong.  
 Real Madrid snatched a 3-2 victory at Valencia to remain five points behind Spanish leaders Barcelona, who triumphed 1-0 in the Catalan derby with Espanyol earlier on Saturday night.  Real, missing the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, needed an 83rd-minute winner from substitute defender Ezequiel Garay as all five goals came in the second half at the Mestalla.  Madrid had twice gone ahead through Garay's fellow Argentinian Gonzalo Higuain but Valenciawho won last season's corresponding fixture 3-0battled back through Spain striker David Villa and Joaquin Sanchez.  Sergio Ramos headed against the post in the first half, but Real suffered a big blow when fellow defender Pepe was stretchered off just before the interval after the Portugal international fell awkwardly.  Higuain, who turned 22 on Thursday, headed the opening goal from Karim Benzema's cross nine minutes after the break, but Villa leveled six minutes later as he headed in off the underside of the crossbar from Jeremy Mathieu's cross to make up for David Navarro's close-range miss just beforehand.  Marcelo then set up Higuain for his eighth goal this seasonall of which have come in the past seven gamesbut substitute Joaquin beat goalkeeper Iker Casillas at his near post in the 80th minute.  However, Garay's glancing header from Xabi Alonso's free-kick kept Real in touch with Barca, who have played one more match.  The Spanish and European champions needed a controversial penalty from Zlatan Ibrahimovic to edge past their city rivals Espanyol at the Nou Camp.  The Swede slotted his 11th league goal this season, one behind top scorer Villa, after Xavi went down in the area despite minimal contact from former Barcelona youth player Raul Baena six minutes before halftime.  The hosts started with Thierry Henry in the absence of injured European player of the year Lionel Messi, but the Frenchman and Ibrahimovic were unable to take advantage of several chances.  Pep Guardiola's team will now head to Dubai for the FIFA World Club Cup, where they will meet Atlante in the semifinals following the Mexican team's 3-0 win against New Zealand champions Auckland on Saturday.  Espanyol suffered a fifth straight defeat, but cannot end the weekend in the relegation zone thanks to Real Zaragoza's 2-1 defeat at home to Athletic Bilbao earlier on Saturday.  The Basque side bounced back from last weekend's 2-1 home defeat to Valencia to go seventh above Sporting Gijon, who host fourth-placed Sevilla on Sunday.  Sevilla are one point behind Valencia, who trail Barcelona by 11 and Real by six.

A medical doctor-turned Libertarian Senate candidate in Iowa died when a plane he was piloting crashed  around 11 p.m. Monday.  Doug Butzier, 59, was earning less than 2% of the vote in the competitive statewide race between Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst to replace retiring veteran Sen. Tom Harkin.  "He was a leader among his peers," said Russell Knight, the president of Mercy Medical Center-Dubuque, the hospital where Butzier worked. "We will all miss his strong, intelligent, thoughtful presence, and we express our collective condolences to Doug's family, friends, and colleagues."  Butzier was a practicing emergency medicine doctor and president of the medical staff at the hospital, according to his campaign website.  Information about the cause of the crash has not been publicly released, although the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate.  The plane failed in its first approach to land on the runway, and it crashed the second time, according to a local news report. It remains unclear if weather played a role in the crash, although it was raining during the day and into the night Monday.  Because the deadline for changing candidates has passed, Butzier's name will still appear on ballots in Iowa next month. Both Braley and Ernst released statements expressing condolences to Butzier's friends and family. He is survived by his wife and two sons.  
 (CareerBuilder.com)"When the cat's away, the mice will play," is a term most people can relate to. When the manager is gonebe it on vacation or just away from her desksome employees act like a teenager whose parents are out of town.  They sneak out early or come in late. They chitchat with co-workers more frequently, usually about nonwork-related things. They make personal phone calls, take extra-long lunchesheck, maybe they'll even enjoy a cocktail with their meal.  Many employees do itbut why?  "The answer is simple: It's a direct reflection of the boss's leadership. When a workplace isn't compelling to peoplewhere employees lack the desire and ability to be accountable for their own successmisbehaving or slacking in the boss's absence is merely a mask for boredom. It's also important feedback for the boss: "Raise your game," says Linda Galindo, a consultant specializing in individual and leadership accountability and the author of "The 85% Solution: How Personal Accountability Guarantees Success."  We asked employees what they do when the boss isn't looking. They had some very entertaining stories:  "At the time I was an assistant manager at Publix Supermarkets of Florida. Not content with the absolute misery of the hourly employees I was responsible for, I tried to inspire and entertain them. It worked; those under me had the highest productivity rate, got the best raises, were promoted faster and would do just about anything in the world for me because they knew I would do anything in my power for them. While this usually meant me working alongside them or personally training them for continuous quality improvements, it occasionally took on a slightly wilder side. Riding a motorcycle through the store aisles after closing, bowling for two-liter soda bottles with frozen turkeys, baseball in the stockroom, laser tag on the roof, contests to see who could catch the most shoplifters, hide and seek, a chess tournament, foot races, pizza parties, karate training, book club and a few hundred practical jokes." J.Olson  "I've been building my life-coaching business for over a year while I've held down an executive assistant job from 9-6, Monday through Friday. The boss works across the street from the office that I'm at, and I spend the majority of my day (at least four hours, maybe more) building my coaching businessposting to my blog, tweeting, communicating with clients, writing newsletters, even doing sessions during my lunchbreakyou name it!. Thankfully it's paidoffI'm giving notice in about a month to coach full-time." M.W.  "When I worked at this pizza shop, myself and two fellow employees would try to make each other laugh by making faces behind the boss. For example, I would be running the oven and the boss would be right next to me, so if I laughed I was screwed. So my friend X would be at the cook line, about 2 feet behind my boss so I can see him and the boss couldn't. And the facial expressions and motions he would make were hilarious. I must say I never [saw] him get caught." M.W.  "[My] story has more to do with a colleague who always has some very important thing to do at home/with the baby/his elderly mother-in-law, or has a sudden urgent need to deliver something to one of our member organizations that takes him out of the office for long stretches of time when the executive director is away. Recently, when the boss went on an extended holiday around Christmas/New Years, I and another colleague kept a spreadsheet of this slacker's arrivals, lunch breaks and departures, and then averaged out the numbers. All told, he was in the office an average of 5.5 hours a day while the boss was away. And, given all the adorable postings I see on Facebook from him every night, I imagine there's at least another hour in there taken up in Facebook upkeep and Web browsing." D.C.  "To be honest, before I became a boss and I worked for someone else, I did some of everything when the boss was a way. From surfing the Internet to making personal calls and paying bills [to] taking an extra hour at lunch [to] going home early to sleep. I've even made out with a woman or two at the office."J.D.  "I know what one of my employees was doing when I was out of the office or at meetings. She was on Facebook! A few vendors told me about it privately, so I set out to bust her in the act. I invited her to become my Facebook friend, and she took the bait. Then, I wrote her up and attached the summary of the days and times she was commenting on her Facebook page, which was during business hours, while I was away. I don't particularly like writing up employees, but I loved this write up with the Facebook evidence attached!" K.P.W  "When our bosses aren't looking or even better when they walk away and leave their computers unlocked, someone sneaks in and sends a short e-mail to someone else in the office. These e-mails range from the quirky to the flirtatious to the potentially insulting, but they are always good for a laugh. At least as long as the boss still isn't looking."  --T.D.  "I work in a small doctor's office with only one doctor. My office manager is very cool and participates in our slacking. When the doc or his wife are not around and we don't have any patients ... we make fun of the doc and his wife. When we make fun of our bosses, we really make fun of them and create scenarios that we act out, we raise our voices to impersonate them, and when we laugh, we laugh really loud. We also order food during lunch and eat it in the waiting room where we have a TV, computers and Internet (something that is not allowed during work hours). We snoop on the doc's computer. We always catch him on the Internet so we like to see what he does on the computer all the time. Needless to say, we found porn in his favorites! Also, his wife forgets to sign out of her e-mail (don't ask me why) but everyone uses the computers so we saw in her e-mail a message that read 'Thank you for signing up to lesbian porn.'" Vanessa  "For the past two years I've been self-employed, but before I started my company I always enjoyed reading news articles on the Internet during the day. My project managers often frowned upon us surfing the Internet during the day, but I found a creative way around this. At the beginning of the day I'd find interesting articles online and copy and paste the text into a word document. The word document had the company logo in the header, so if somebody walked by my cube it would appear that I was reading an official work-related document rather than the top sports news of the day." S.M.  "I have a co-worker who is two completely different people when our boss is out of the office. When she is in, he makes sure to get to work before her and leave after her, even though he is just messing around on Skype and YouTube all day long. She took a one-week vacation in August, and he worked 9-5 every day (our hours are 8:00 to 6:30). Then, he put the icing on the cake in the week after Christmas. Most of our team was out of town, including our boss. Apparently he thought he was going to be the only one in the office, and didn't even come in to work. He'd occasionally send out an email to make it seem like he was there. Finally, on the Wednesday after Christmas, he strolled in around 11:00 am. When he saw another team member was here, he turned beet red, and stammered how he thought she was out for the week. No one has said anything to our boss yet, but we are dying to."  --J.J.  "I placed an online order to American Apparel to restock my underwear supply. Instead of shipping them to my house, I had them shipped to the officemore reliable. When the package arrived, I couldn't wait to see what the panties looked like ON. Literally, I couldn't wait. I didn't even take time to close my office door. I pulled out the first pair (light blue thong), lifted up my skirt, and pulled the panties over my leggings. They were cute! Unfortunately, just at that moment my boss arrived at my doora 60-year-old man face to face with a 28-year-old female employee. It wasn't good. Next time I'll wait until he's out of the office to try on my undies." K.H.  &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

WASHINGTON Nearly 40 years after members of a U.S. cavalry unit put their lives in peril to save 100 fellow soldiers trapped under blistering enemy fire in Vietnam, they received the Presidential Unit Citation on Tuesday.  Veterans watch Tuesday's ceremony, which recognized members of a U.S. cavalry unit.  It's an honor their captain says is long overdue.  President Obama awarded the citation for extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry to 86 members of the Army's Troop A, First Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment.  "These soldiers defined the meaning of bravery and heroism," Obama said at a White House reception honoring the group's heroics.  "It's never too late. You can never say it enough. ... We honor your service, and America is forever grateful."  On March 26, 1970, the 120-member Troop A volunteered to rescue an American infantry company surrounded by an overwhelming enemy force at a site on the Cambodian border called the Dog's Face. The enemy had survived hours of aerial and artillery bombardment and was expected to kill or capture the 100 American infantrymen in Company C within hours. The Americans were running out of ammunition and could not move because of heavy casualties. There were no available landing zones for medical and rescue helicopters to touch down.  Alpha Troop heard of their plight on a radio and rode in with an infantry company to rescue their comrades.  "Troop A skillfully penetrated four kilometers of nearly impassable jungle terrain and unhesitatingly mounted a fierce assault directly into the heavily fortified North Vietnamese army position," the presidential proclamation states.  When the battle was over, more than 70 Americans lay dead or wounded.  For retired Capt. John Poindexter, who led the rescue, the award is for all Vietnam veterans, many of whom came home to an unwelcome and sometimes hostile reception.  "The veterans of Alpha Troop feel very strongly that we stand in the stead of all veterans of the war of Vietnam," Poindexter told CNN before the ceremony. "The fact is that we're being singled out for a very distinct honor, a very rare one, but it is our conviction that on any day in any other jungle in Vietnam, nearly every Vietnam veteran would have been willing to assume the task that we assumed on March 26, 1970, when we earned the Presidential Unit Citation."  Poindexter had been trying to gain recognition for his men for the past seven years. Initially, he felt deep disappointment.  In 2003, he discovered that the men he had recommended for decorations for their valor had not received those citations. Eventually, 14 men received individual decorations.  That was not enough.  "My role in obtaining the PUC [Presidential Unit Citation]or in helping to obtain the PUCamong the 200 persons who were involved in this matter over a seven-year period, was to be in the unhappy position of discovering that the men who I had recommended for decorations had not been recommended, had not been awarded those decorations," the retired captain said.  "The result of that was that we got 14 men decorated for their valor, but 14 men out of more than 120 who were engaged in the battle on that fateful day were only a pittance, only a minority, of those who might have been honored. Only a unit citation could honor all equally and impartially, and it was that task we set ourselves on nearly seven years ago. "  He believes lack of popular support for the war had much to do with it taking so long for Alpha Troop to be recognized.  "There's little question in our minds that the unpopularity of the war in Vietnam is a major contributing factor to the reception these men received when they returned to the United States and a major factor, in my opinion, in the silence that most of them have assumed since then," Poindexter said.  "Why talk about something that most people don't have a very high opinion of in all likelihood? And if that isn't true, nevertheless, it's what most of these men think. They were engaged in an unpopular venture that has bedeviled them for much of their adult lives."  Now, the circle has been closed.  "It's a very elevating experience to see the men that I have not seen for 40 years since War Zone C in Vietnam," the former captain said. "These are persons who have had success in life, and some have not had a lot of success in life, and to see how they've turned out, how they look these days, and to know I'll be with them in the White House [Tuesday] is a very fulfilling sensation for me.  "For me, the sensation of being honored is one of having closed an important chapter on my life in a very fruitful and rewarding way."  The Presidential Unit Citation is awarded to armed forces units of the United States and allies for extraordinary heroism against an armed enemy on or after December 7, 1941. The unit must display such gallantry, determination and esprit de corps under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same campaign.  
 At least 13 people were killed and 20 others were injured when a severe storm tore through the Buenos Aires area, state media reported Thursday.  Residents of the city awakened to crumbling walls, crushed cars, fallen trees and scattered branches after heavy rain, wind and hail hit Wednesday night, the state-run Telam agency said.  "The level of virulence of this storm is not normal," said Diego Santilli, the city's environment minister, according to Telam. "The winds were similar to those of a tornado."  One resident told the news agency that the Parque Avellaneda neighborhood "looks like they threw a bomb." Fallen trees blocked streets. A wall in at least one historic building collapsed, Telam said.  Damage occurred within the city limits and also in the surrounding province, where at least nine people were killed when they were crushed or electrocuted, Telam said.  Wind gusts ranged from 100 kph to 120 kph (62 mph to 75 mph), said Luciano Timerman, a provincial emergency official, Telam reported.  Authorities evacuated 500 people in the western and southern areas of the metropolitan area as the storm raged, Timerman said. They were returning to their homes on Thursday.

Samantha Stosur stopped Caroline Wozniacki from clinching the year-end women's No. 1 tennis ranking with a shock 6-4 6-3 victory at the WTA Championships in Qatar on Wednesday night.  The Australian romped to her second straight victory in the Maroon Group, following her revenge win over French Open champion Francesca Schiavone on Tuesday.  The Roland Garros runner-up's kick serve was a potent weapon against Wozniacki, with the triumph giving the 26-year-old every chance of reaching the semifinals ahead of her final group match against Russia's Elena Dementieva on Thursday.  It was her second victory over a top-ranked player this year, having beaten Serena Williams on the way to reaching the final in Paris.  The fifth seed fired 26 winners to Wozniacki's 14, and could afford to serve two double-faults in the deciding game before the Dane returned a backhand long on her first match-point.  Wozniacki, who thrashed seventh seed Dementieva on Tuesday, will next take on Italy's Schiavone on Thursday.  Kim Clijsters, who won the $4.5 million season-ending event in 2002 and 2003, earlier triumphed in her opening White Group match 6-2 6-3 against fellow former No. 1 Jelena Jankovic despite serving 10 double-faults.  The Belgian, returning to action after having a mole cut off her foot, broke Jankovic to love in the first game of the match and then again in the seventh.  The three-time U.S. Open champion was less impressive in the second set but had enough to see off the Serbian, who is struggling with illness in the oppressive heat in Doha.  "It wasn't my best tennis, but it was good enough. I felt I did a lot of good things, and there are a few things I need to tweak. The more matches I get, the better it will go," said Clijsters, who plays eighth seed Victoria Azarenka on Thursday.  Azarenka was disappointed after squandering a great chance to upset second-seeded Russian Vera Zvonareva, with the Belarusian losing 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 in the day's first match despite leading by a break in both sets.  "I had a lot of chances and was very unlucky in some moments. There were like one million nets from her side," Sunday's Kremlin Cup champion told the event's official website.  "It's part of the game though. I think I played a good match and I'm still in the groupI still have chances to play further. I'm going to keep fighting and trying to do my best.  "It's very humid here. Sometimes your racquet just slips out of your hands. It's the same conditions for everybody, but I had less time to prepare than anybody else. I'm still happy to be here and I have to regroup from today."  It was Zvonareva's second successive win, following her victory over Jankovic on Tuesday, and she is the only player in the eight-woman field who can overtake the 20-year-old Wozniacki in the rankings.  "It's maybe one of the longest straight-set matches I've ever played. We've played so many times before, I'm just happy to get through," said Zvonareva, who trailed 4-2 in the first set and 3-1 in the second before winning in one hour 45 minutes.  Meanwhile, the United States has named former men's No. 1 player Jim Courier as the successor to Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe.  The 40-year-old, who twice won the teams event as a player, takes charge ahead of next March's World Group first-round clash with Chile.  McEnroe had been captain for 10 years, but stood down last month. The U.S. lost 3-2 to Serbia in the opening round in March.  
 (EW.com)The "Good Wife" returns Sunday night (CBS, 9 p.m. ET), and while we're all eager to meet Kalinda's estranged husband Nick (check out our scoop on him here, and find out who was behind the door in the clip below), there's more to look forward to in season 4.   The arrival of Nathan Lane. We'll also meet his recurring character, the firm's appointed trustee Clarke Hayden, in the season premiere. "He becomes a foil to everyone, but primarily Diane and Will," co-creator Robert King says. "We've been studying a lot about law firm bankruptcies, and when you want to restructure to give yourself relief from your creditors, sometimes a bank or court will order in a trustee. A trustee is someone who represents the creditors' interest, and he or she is brought in above the managers, or the partners in this case. He basically can veto any decisions of the partners." It's an especially interesting time for Will, who'll be practicing again now that his suspension is over. "Because they are in this kind of bankruptcy limbo where they have to make a certain amount to pay off the creditors in a certain amount of time, it's a very bad time to find a conscience. Just like we're all struggling with that in this economy: How much do you let your ethics lead, and how much do you let your pragmatism lead? Will's gonna be struggling with that almost daily." And don't forget about David Lee. "David Lee's someone who has new clout given this bankruptcy and the fact that family law is doing so well. Given the world of Lockhart Gardner and how much it's struggling, David Lee is a commodity and will have a lot of confrontations with the Nathan Lane character."   Seeing more Cary. "We love Matt Czuchry. We felt we painted ourselves a little into a corner having him over at the State's Attorney's office. It really was good for cases when he was on the other side, and it was really good with the Peter relationship. We got to see what that developed into. But we feel so much better having him again in-house," King admits. "You just want to see more of him. You want to see more contact with Alicia, with Kalinda. So we feel we have a mature Cary coming back to the Lockhart Gardner fold. The irony, of course, is the moment he comes back is when things are just miserable financially over there. So it's both good and bad for him. Cary started as someone who was more pragmatic and then become more ethical over the last three years. We want to see how that plays out now in this new environment where it's kind of dog eat dog." And how will things be between Cary and Kalinda? "There's a difficulty there, because now Kalinda's husband's in town, and so, the Cary-Kalinda relationship isn't a straight line. It never has been, but it gets even more crooked," King says. "And I think the other thing with Cary is we want to see a little bit more of people's home lives this year. It's hard for the show to go too far in that direction, because it can't take you too far from other plot lines."   Eli's focused again on Peter. "We felt we made a mistake with Eli last year. Sorry to admit it now," King says, with a laugh. "But the thing is, Eli seems to have more fun when he has one overwhelming goal for the year, as opposed to little goals. And the goal for the year is to get Peter elected governor. And Eli has never played in the big leagues like this before. And to see an Eli, who is unhinged, try to get Peter elected is just going to be very fun I think both for Alan Cumming and the audience, who will see him dealing with a lot that we see now nationally with Romney and Obama  the mix of serious issues but also being tainted by frivolous issues. How do you separate the two and should you? How do you keep what's frivolous in the public's eye so they don't start questioning about Peter's past with a prostitute or Peter's time in prison? It's not just a defensive game, it's an offensive game, and Eli becomes a master at that game."   Jackie and Eli! "You're gonna see Jackie first in episode 4, and she's gonna have a stronger presence this year, partly because Jackie is someone who will use anything to get what she wants, and now she's using her potential illness as another weapon in her arsenal. The other thing is for the campaign, it's very important when you're going state-wide in Illinois that you get the senior vote. And Jackie can pull in seniors who would otherwise be reluctant to vote for someone who slept with prostitutes," King says. "So obviously, what we love about that is her fights with Eli. So Alan Cumming and Mary Beth Peil are for us a couple from comedy heaven. We want to see more of those struggles as they go through the campaign this year."   A different kind of Peter. "The third season was a Peter who wanted to do things differently. This year is a Peter who really wants to win, and how do you keep your ethics when you really want to win? Do you just let other people around you do the dirty work for you, or do you engage on that?" King says. "Some of the issues from the year before will come back for him, supposed racism in his department and other issues. So what we want to see a Peter who has to deal with these things sometimes by ignoring them and letting Eli just handle them."   How Peter's campaign affects Alicia. "There's a more engaged Alicia this year because she really wants her husband to win, too. Not for any power move on her part, but because she's afraid of what the opposition will bring," King says. But there are issues. Let's start with the kids: "Zach's 17, Grace is 15. Zach really wants to be involved with the campaign. Alicia doesn't want it. But at a certain point, the kids reach the age where they're not off-limits anymore. How do you keep them from being involved with the campaign when they're kind of being dragged into the campaign by the press?" King says. "And what we like about that is what it does for Alicia. Her natural instinct has always been to protect her kids, but then it becomes a question mark: is it really appropriate anymore to protect them as much as she wants to?" As the issue of race becomes part of the campaign, the fact that Zach is dating an African-American young woman could be useful. "The difficulty obviously is where does Alicia draw the line when she knowingly is being used: Do you just start having a jaundiced eye toward the fact, or do you really draw the line and say, 'I will not allow our family to be used this way?' And that's a struggle within Alicia because she's not a kid anymore and she's not naive about how the world works."  There's also Alicia's friendship with Maura Tierney's recurring character, wealthy businesswoman Maddie Hayward, who makes her first appearance in the second episode. Eli will want Maddie to endorse Peter. "The difficulty dramatically for characters on our show is where do you draw a line between the personal and the professional. And sometimes, more often than not, people don't draw the line. Everything that's professional is personal and everything that's personal is professional. And for Alicia, that's a very difficult balance. Sometimes she wants someone to be a friend and not there to be an agenda."  See original story at EW.com.

	 'The "Good Wife" returns Sunday night (CBS, 9 p.m'
Simferopol, Ukraine On a dusty, pot-holed road south from the Crimean capital, Simferopol, there is a battered sign in Cyrillic. "Yalta," it says, pointing the way to the town on the Black Sea where UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, USSR Premier Joseph Stalin and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt met secretly in February 1945. It was at this Crimean resort that the "Big Three" debated the future of Europe  Nearly 70 years later, Crimea is again at the heart of that argument.  Most historians conclude that Stalin was the "winner" at Yalta. There was little discussion of Eastern Europe, which was soon to fall within the Soviet orbit. Churchill and Roosevelt won no meaningful concessions on Poland, already occupied by Soviet troops.  The ailing U.S. President's main aim was to win agreement on setting up the United Nations, where the United States and Soviet Union would spend the next 40 years vetoing each other's resolutions in the Security Council.  Yalta was the preamble to the Cold War. Facts on the groundthe sweep westward of the Red Armystrengthened Stalin's hand. In the House of Commons after returning from the conference, Churchill asked of the Poles: "Are their sovereignty and independence to be untrammeled, or are they to become a mere projection of the Soviet state?"  The answera sham election in 1947 that sealed Communist rulewas not long in coming.  The Iron Curtain, a term coined by Churchill, may have long fallen, holding out the promise to what former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev called "our common European home."  But arguments over sovereignty, self-determination and spheres of influence are suddenly electric again. And they are playing out in the Crimean Peninsula.  Land hungry or quelling 'fascists'?  The Russian flag already flies across Crimea. Pro-Ukrainian rallies attract a couple of hundred people. Most Ukrainians here seem resigned to the new order, although a steady stream have taken the train north to stay in Kiev, for the time being at least. Cossacks now guard government buildings, and the new self-installed government talks of plans for adopting the ruble and Moscow's time-zone.  Billboards proclaiming "Together With Russia" are everywhere. Flights from Ukraine into Simferopol, currently suspended, will be directed to the international terminal if they ever resume. And a border, with barbed wire and checkpoints, is already taking shape across the neck of land that joins Crimea to the rest of Ukraine.  The other evening, an elderly man shuffled in the shadow of the statue of Lenin that still dominates Simferopol's largest square. He carried a flag, the hammer and sickle of the Soviet era, and a photograph, of Stalin. To older Russians here who remember the collaboration of some Ukrainians with the Nazis, the nationalist politicians now in government in Kiev are "fascists."  They claim the "Right Sector" in Ukraine is planning to sabotage Sunday's referendum in Crimea with acts of provocation. Referendum billboards in Sevastopolthe home of Russia's Black Sea fleetdisplay maps of Russia and Ukraine, the latter stamped with a swastika.  And then there is the opposite narrative.  Many Ukrainiansincluding interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenykthink Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to expand Russia to the old borders of the Soviet Union. They say that if Moscow is allowed to annex Crimea, it will look hungrily to eastern Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. They lament what they saw as the West's indifference when Russian tanks came within 50 miles of the Georgian capital Tbilisi in 2008.  And they fear Putin will continue to do all in his power to stop Ukraine from knocking at the door of that "common European home" by seeking to join the European Union.  Even in the Baltic states, politicians liken events today in Crimea to Stalin's gobbling up of their countries in 1940. Germany has gone as far as to reassure the Baltic republicswhich have sizeable Russian speaking minoritiesthat as members of NATO they will be secure.  But the alarm at unfolding events is palpablein Berlin, Paris and other western capitals. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Russia was taking advantage of Ukraine's weakness. That is how wars began in the 19th and 20th centuries, she said, "which we thought we had overcome."  Historical ring in Russian warning  Putinbuoyed by rocketing approval ratings at homeseems unmoved by U.S. threats of what Merkel called "massive political and economic consequences" for Russia should it absorb Crimea. What those consequences will be remains unclear, but they seem likely to begin with visa restrictions and the freezing of foreign assets held by the new pro-Russian leadership and its supporters in Crimea.  The justification would be that they have illegally and unconstitutionally taken over part of a sovereign country. Should Russia go ahead and annex Crimea, sanctions would likely be extended to prominent Russians.  But the Russian military exercises close to Ukraine's eastern border over the past few days may be designed to warn that consequences will in turn have consequences.  On Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a stark warning about unrest in eastern Ukraine, where Russian speakers make up about half the population.  After Ukrainian and pro-Russian protesters clashed in Donetsk on Thursday, reportedly leaving two dead, Moscow said it had repeatedly warned the new government in Kiev that it must "disarm the militants, provide security for the population and legal rights for people during demonstrations."  The Foreign Ministry statement went on: "Russia acknowledges its responsibility for the lives of its compatriots and fellow citizens in Ukraine and reserves the right to take these people under its protection."  That too has an historical ring.  Seventy-five years ago, on March 15, 1939, Adolf Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht into the Sudetenland, a German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia. His justification was simple: "I am simply demanding that the oppression of three and a half million Germans in Czechoslovakia cease and that the inalienable right to self-determination take its place."  
 Search crews found a second body in the ruins of a furniture store destroyed by a gas explosion in Wayne, Michigan, the city's fire chief said early Thursday.  The body of a 54-year-old woman, a store employee, was pulled from the rubble of Franks Furniture around 10:45 p.m. Wednesday, according to Wayne Fire Chief Mel Moore.  Earlier in the day, the body of a 64-year-old man was also recovered. He was identified only as a male employee of the store, who lived in Westland, Michigan.  The store's owner, Paul Franks, 64, was pulled from the wreckage shortly after the explosion, which occurred at about 9 a.m., City Manager John Zech said. He was in serious but stable condition at the University of Michigan Hospital's burn unit.  Search and rescue crews, aided by heavy equipment, continued to remove huge amounts of rubble from the scene of the blast, which damaged several buildings in addition to the furniture store. Moore said the process was made more difficult by the removal of "thousands of pounds of concrete" from the store's roof trusses.  As many as 300 people were evacuated after the explosion and a second reported leak in a neighborhood adjoining the furniture store in the suburban Detroit city.  As of Wednesday night, residents of all but nine homes were able to return, and were being offered lodging elsewhere for the night, said Debra Dodd, a spokeswoman for the gas utility, Consumers Energy.  Mayor Abdul "Al" Haidous described Frank's Furniture as one of the "jewels" of the city, and said Franks has been a leader in civic life. "He has served this city with a great deal of integrity," the mayor said  Before the explosion, a Consumers Energy gas worker was two blocks away investigating the reported gas leak, Dodd said.  "We don't know at this time what caused the incident this morning," Dodd said Wednesday night, but added that the utility will work with the state Public Service Commission in investigating.

WASHINGTON CIA vs. DNIthe clash of the titans.  Dennis Blair, left, was picked to be director of national intelligence and Leon Panetta to head the CIA.  In the old world, the CIA director ruled. He not only ran the spy agency, but he wore a second hat as director of Central Intelligence.  The DCI was ostensibly responsible for coordinating the activities of all 16 agencies and departments which make up the intelligence community.  Then came along the DNI (Director of National Intelligence) in 2005 a product of intelligence reform following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  Those intelligence failures were proof that you needed one person to focus exclusively on guiding the community.  Running the CIA in itself was a full-time job. The DNI would oversee the entire intelligence community while the CIA director concentrated on running the spy agency.  But there's a problem with this setup. Although the DNI was given more input into budgets and personnel than the DCI had, the DNI's powers are limited and somewhat vague. The intelligence chief has a say in lots of things, but there's no real muscle behind his decisions. It's not like the defense secretary, who has absolute authority over all department components.  Outgoing CIA Director Mike Hayden recently told reporters there is natural tension between the CIA and DNI, but it's "not a bad structure."  He did suggest, however, that the DNI's office was getting a bit bloated. "Americans being Americans, they're going to fill up their day trying to doing something impactful," he said, "which means between the two of us there's going to be a trench line ... out there."  And how did departing DNI Mike McConnell respond to Hayden's quip?  "Anytime you have organizations that have similar interests, you're going to have disputes," he said. "And particularly if the two leaders aren't working together and having a partnership and so on, the warfare at the trench level gets to be pretty much a raging battle."  McConnell said he had a good professional relationship with Hayden, so they made it work. But he added, "we don't have a department of intelligence. If this were the Department of Defense, there wouldn't be any question, but it isn't."  CIA nominee Leon Panetta got into the middle of the dispute during his confirmation hearing.  Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, wanted to know Panetta's understanding of the relationship between the CIA and the DNI. Would he be under the supervision of the DNI?  Initially, Panetta said he reported to the DNI and performed the tasks assigned to him by the DNI, but then he added: "we are an operational arm, just like the [National Security Agency], just like the [National Reconnaissance Office], and I believe the role of the DNI is to coordinate all our activities..."  Well, the NSA and the NRO are part of the Defense Department and report directly to the Defense Secretary, not the DNI. The CIA is the only intelligence agency that is not part of another department.  A bit baffled by Panetta's response, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, asked him point blank, "Is the DNI your boss or not?" Panetta's answer, "The DNI is my boss."  It makes you wonder how Panetta and the other new guyDNI Dennis Blairwill play in the sand box.  
 Felipe Massa has revealed that he hopes to be at his home Brazilian Grand Prixbut he won't be behind the wheel of his Ferrari.  Felipe Massa has been given the all-clear to begin training as he bids to return to the race track.  The 28-year-old had aimed to be able to return to racing before the end of this Formula One season, but is resigned to getting fit for 2010 following his horrific crash in July.  Massa is now able to begin his rehabilitation after having plastic surgery on Monday to repair the broken bone in his cranium that resulted when a loose spring from Rubens Barrichello's Brawn hit him in the helmet during qualifying in Hungary.  The operation, at the Sao Paulo's Albert Einstein hospital, took around four and a half hours, Ferrari revealed on its official Web site.  Massa told UK newspaper The Guardian that his next step was to head to Europe to use a simulator and drive go-karts as part of his fitness evaluation.  He had hoped to return to action at Interlagoswhere his 2008 world championship dream was crushed by Lewis Hamilton despite winning the raceon October 18, but said that he would only be there as a spectator.  "That was the race I wanted to come back in, but it's difficult to say if it would've been possible. It will be difficult to watch it, but I will be there," Massa said.  He told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that he still held a slim hope of driving in the final race of this season in Abu Dhabi on November 1.  "In 2010 I'll be back for sure and 100%, but it would be a dream to drive in Abu Dhabi," Massa said.  Massa will be replaced by Giancarlo Fisichella for the final five races of 2009, with the veteran Italian having been released from his contract by Force India to take over from test driver Luca Badoer.  He said he had never doubted that he would that he would get behind the wheel of a Formula One car again.  "It is my life," Massa, who is expecting his first child in November, told The Guardian. "For me, the worst thing that happened was not being able to race. If you can't drive that's terrible.  "But my wife has already asked me, at least 10 times, 'Are you sure you don't feel any doubts or worries?'  "Always, I say, 'No, because this is what I like to do.' If I don't drive then I am not the same person. Ever since I was a small boy this is my life. This is what I like to do.  "So I really hope, and expect, nothing will change inside me when I go back into the car and start pushing myself to the maximum again."

A frog that eats birds and a gecko with leopard stripes are among the 163 new species discovered last year in the Greater Mekong region of southeast Asia, according to a report by the World Wildlife Fund.  The Cat Ba leopard gecko is found exclusively in Cat Ba Island National Park in northern Vietnam.  The discovery of 100 new plants, 28 fish, 18 reptiles, 14 amphibians, two mammals and one bird species highlights the extent of the biodiversity in the region, said Barney Long, head of the WWF's Asian Species Conservation program.  "It's a melting pot of diverse habitats. It has some of the wettest forests on the planet, high mountains, and a diverse array of terrestrial and marine habitats, including the Mekong River," he said.  "We continue to find new species of fish, primates and mammals, and nowhere else compares to the amount of large mammals that have been discovered in the region. It shows how little we know about species in the region," he said. "From a biodiversity perspective, there are still huge amounts to discover about region."  The Greater Mekong consists of the countries through which the Mekong River flows: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and Yunnan Province of China.  With 16 global ecoregionsareas defined by their shared ecological features and animal communitiesthe Greater Mekong has more protected spaces than anywhere else on mainland Asia, according to the WWF.  The colorful Cat Ba leopard gecko of northern Vietnam has large, orange-brown "catlike eyes" and a body of leopard stripes, according to a report released Friday.  Its name refers to its place of origin, Cat Ba Island, the largest of 366 islands in Cat Ba Archipelago and home to many rare species that can only be found on the island. Scientists believe the high number of species unique to the island might be due to the long separation of the island from continental Vietnam, the report says.  Limnonectes megastomiasa fanged frog with an appetite for other frogs, insects and birdshas only been found in three remote areas of medium-to-high altitudes in eastern Thailand.  Globally, new species of mammals are rare finds, but in 2008 alone, new species of the mouselike musk shrew and a tube-nosed bat emerged from the region.  See photos of newly discovered species   War and political unrest have kept large parts of the region, particularly Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar, off-limits to scientific exploration up until the past two decades, Long said.  Since 1997, nearly 1,200 new species have been discovered, many that cannot be found anywhere else, said Dekila Chungyalpa, director of WWF's Greater Mekong Program.  But the rapid pace of development in the Mekong region, coupled with the effects of climate change, are threatening to drive the species into extinction, Chungyalpa said.  "As we become familiar with more species in the region, our understanding of climate change and how it impacts these new species is changing," she said.  Chungyalpa said conservative estimates by the WWF project a 1-meter rise in sea level on the delta's coastline over the next decade, which will affect not only marine life, but also people who rely on the delta as a source of sustenance and employment, she said.  In 2007, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its Fourth Assessment Report, which projected that global sea levels could rise from 18 to 59 centimeters (7 to 23 inches) over the next century based on six possible scenarios.  Already, Chungyalpa said, the area has been affected by an increase in tropical storms off the coast, which brings in more seawater and changes the flooding patterns in the delta. Some researchers, however, have questioned the link between climate change and more intense tropical storms. Apart from climate change, construction of dams and hydropower plants along the delta could further disrupt its waters, potentially displacing millions, destroying sources of drinkable water and disrupting the production of rice, Chungyalpa said.  "The delta is the rice bowl of the region. What will happen to people who depend on it if it's no longer there?" she said.  The WWF says it supports the idea of an agreement among the Mekong countries on how to respond to infrastructure development and climate change in terms of protecting its natural resources and people.  "Climate change is making it obvious that we can't treat development like it's a separate issue," she said. "We need to be addressing this issue now. It's such an immediate issue for us and it's going to change everything in this region if we don't address it."  
 While immigration reform is stalled in Congress, some members are calling on President Barack Obama to take the matter into his own hands, urging him to suspend deportations of undocumented immigrants.  Thirty Democratic members of Congress wrote in a letter that he has the authority to pause deportations of undocumented immigrants, urging "the sensible and moral step of stopping deportations."  Read the letter  "In fact, taking a strong step toward granting relief would move us in the direction of where the immigration debate rightfully should start, with the legalization of eleven million men and women who call the United States their home," the letter states.  The lawmakers are the most prominent of a growing chorus calling on Obama to use his executive authority to exercise "prosecutorial discretion" to suspend deportations of undocumented immigrants.  The issue catapulted to prominence last week when an audience member, Ju Hong, shouted at the President during an event in San Francisco, demanding that he stop deportations.  The President immediately rejected Hong's demand, saying he doesn't have the authority.  Now, some members of Congress say he does.  Obama said he can't stop deportations of immigrants, but maybe he can  "Mr. President, you do have the power to stop what's going on," Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-New York, said at a news conference on Thursday.  In their letter, the members point to executive action in 201,2 when Obama exercised his discretion to suspend deportations of children of undocumented immigrants, known as Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals.  "Please, Mr. President, do something," said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois. "We need you to take the kinds of positive action to help our families."  Although Obama has used his discretion to save some from deportation, he has aggressively expanded the program. He has expelled more people than any other president: For instance, 410,000 people were deported in 2012, compared with 116,000 in 2001.  In their letter, the lawmakers say that 1,100 people are deported every day.  Obama has shifted the type of immigrants targeted for deportation. While the administration of President George W. Bush targeted working immigrants by raiding workplaces, Obama is focusing on convicted criminals and "egregious" immigration violators, including recent border-crossers and illegal re-entrants.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement says its efforts are effective, pointing out that 55% of people deported last year were convicted criminals.  "Criminalizing American families or giving local law enforcement the responsibility to choose who stays and who goes is not the right option," the letter reads.  4 ways immigration reform could still happen - or not  The Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform this year, including a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the United States.  The legislation has been stalled in the House and is unlikely to be taken up before the end of the year.

Washington As military operations against ISIS continue, there is a less visible, but no less important, diplomatic front, as the United States seeks to recruit new international members and keep Arab nations committed and willing to help strike both within Iraq and Syria.  U.S. officials acknowledge this next, nonmilitary phase will be in some ways harder to implement, and even harder to measure. But they say the Arab support without hesitation to military action, traditionally a harder sell, gives them encouragement that the region is committed to putting its various rivalries aside to concentrate on the fight against ISIS.  On Tuesday, retired Gen. John Allen, the newly appointed envoy to the global coalition, and his deputy, Brett McGurk, head to the region, where they will press nations to stop the flow of foreign fighters across their borders to join ISIS' ranks and to stem financing, both considered the lifeblood of the military group.  The ranks of the coalition have swelled since its formation began in earnest last month, although is unclear how many have signed on.  Speaking at the United Nations last week, U.S. President Barack Obama claimed more than 40 nations, though a day earlier Secretary of State John Kerry put the number at more than 50. Now the State Department points to more than 60 coalition partners, including the European Union, the United Nations and the Arab League.  John Kerry: The fight against ISIS is 'going to go on'  Obama: U.S. misjudged ISIS threat  As of Friday, the coalition had carried out more than 200 strikes in Iraq and 43 in Syria, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters. The United States had done the lion's share of the bombing, although Arab states have contributed significantly. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan all participated in last week's strikes in Syria. France carried out an airstrike in Iraq earlier this month.  The American-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq grew by four on Fridayincluding Belgium, Britain and Denmark.  The U.S. got a major boost when Prime Minster David Cameron of Britain won approval from Parliament, after describing the militants as "psychopathic terrorists who want to kill us."  British lawmakers approved a limited deployment, but only in Iraq. Syria wasn't even on the table, to avoid the same embarrassing defeat the British Prime Minister experienced last year when Parliament rejected his call to join the United States in strikes against Syria, casting doubt on Britain's reputation as America's closest ally during times of crisis.  More than a military effort  Contributors to the effort go well beyond taking part in military operations. Some nations are contributing planes, while others are sending ammunition and weapons to Iraqi and Kurdish forces and special forces to train the Iraqi army. Still others are offering refueling assistance. Canada, Australia, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Estonia, Albania and the Czech Republic all have made contributions to the military effort.  But the bulk of the donations is directed toward the campaign against ISIS in Iraq. As in Britain, public opinion in many European nations does not support an air campaign in Syria, out of fear of either starting a wider regional war or helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad cement his brutal grip on power.  U.S. officials say they are not bothered, and suggest the discrepancy is overblown. While support for strikes in Syria is symbolically important, they insist American military might, supported by Arab manpower, is more than sufficient. Moreover, they add, the effort to dislodge ISIS from Iraq, for which they have considerable support from partners, is equally important.  Still, the administration does hold out hope that many of its coalition partners will follow Washington's own playbookstarting with the effort in Iraq, while building public support for wider involvement to include Syria. Cameron seemed to suggest as much by telling Parliament there was more he wanted Britain to contribute to the coalition effort in time.  U.S. aims to cut ISIS oil revenue  The effort to cut off funding to terrorist groups is an area where cooperation is much less tangible. Since 9/11 the U.S. has urged its Gulf allies to crack down on private financing to extremists in the region, with mixed results. And since the Syrian conflict began more than three years ago, funding to various Syrian opposition groups has often ended up in the hands of more extremist elements.  In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Kerry said the threat ISIS poses to the region has been a wake-up call for nations to get serious about stopping the funding, including to Syrian groups.  "State-sponsored support of these groups, I believe, is overis ended. There are still individuals within certain countries who have been funneling money to these groups. The theory back in the beginning by many of these people were, well, we're going to get rid of Assad and then we'll focus on these bad apples," Kerry said. "They realized it morphed into something more ominous, more threatening, and so I think people have really pulled back."  Today, ISIS is not just one of the most dangerous organizations, it is also one of the richest. Beyond private donations, the group has emerged as a ruthless terror corporation, earning millions of dollars every day from black market sales of oil in areas it controls. Oil is smuggled out of Syria by ISIS tankers, driven along secret routes in Turkey's southern corridor and sold by middlemen and local tribes.  Airstrikes against some of the organization's refineries have sought to limit ISIS' own use of the crude, but an important new phase of the U.S. coalition effort is focused on getting neighboring countries to clamp down on black markets and networks handling the sale of oil, which is fueling its reign of terror.  Looking for new coalition partners  Turkey is central to all these efforts. Ankara committed last week to joining the anti-ISIS coalition, but it has provided no details on what it will do. Turkey stayed on the sidelines while ISIS held 49 Turkish hostages, but those hostages were freed September 20. U.S. officials say they expect Turkey to play a major role going forward in many aspects of the campaign, but its role remains far from clear.  Russia, too, has been vague about what role it could play. Last week, Moscow said it would join in the fight against ISIS, but did not mention the coalition and has opposed the strikes in Syria, saying the U.S. should have sought permission from al-Assad.  One often overlooked, but critical, aspect of the fight against ISIS is the communications battle. The U.S. is looking for Arab states to undertake a major effort to, in the Kerry's words, "reclaim Islam by Muslims, by those to whom it belongs." The U.S. is urging countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to get their clerics to speak out against the group and Arab networks like Al Jazeera and Al-Arabiya to counter ISIS' sophisticated media machine.  The success or failure of that communications effort could ultimately have repercussions for the resolve of a coalition that depends so heavily on buy-in from Arab states.  "I'm absolutely convinced the coalition is on board. There's no question about it. And they proved that in the air, in their willingness to joinhistorically, to many people's amazement, they all came together," Kerry told Amanpour. "There's a sense of purpose now in this focus."  
 Baghdad, Iraq Iraqi parliament members adjourned on Saturday without reaching an accord on a controversial new elections law, and the lawmakers could make another try to forge and pass legislation tomorrow.  Abdul Bari al-Zebari and Mahmoud Othman, Kurdish members of the Council of Representatives, told CNN that the session is adjourned until Sunday because lawmakers didn't forge an agreement.  Passage of the law on Sunday is expected to ensure that national elections would be held on January 16.  Al-Zebari said several Sunni Arab parliament members boycotted the Saturday session and doubts there will be a Sunday vote. Othman told CNN that lawmakers couldn't reach an accord over the issue of Kirkuk and said some Sunni Arab and Turkmen members left the session.  But the biggest roadblock to a new election law is the question of how balloting should unfold in the ethnically diverse, oil-rich province of Kirkuk, where Kurds displaced during Saddam Hussein's rule have returned to claim their land.  The power struggle among Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen has been a political hot potato.  Kurds have long regarded Kirkukthe province and the city of the same nameas an integral part of Kurdistan, and many want it to be part of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. Arabs and Turkmen also lay claim to the city and province, and all the groups want their voices and votes to be adequately represented in the political system.  Disgruntled Arab and Turkmen residents say many more Kurds have moved into Kirkuk than were displaced, and that allowing them to vote would create an unfair advantage. Arabs and Turkmen want special measures to adjust for the increased numbers because they believe many of the Kurdish immigrants are there illegally. The Kurds insist there should be no special voting procedures and reject a United Nations' proposal that singles out Kirkuk for special treatment.  The disagreements among the groups spurred the postponement of provincial elections in Kirkuk last January because officials there could not agree on how to apportion seats among the ethnic groups.

Two new Pokmon games, "Pokmon X" and "Pokmon Y," have taken the gaming world by storm, selling more than 4 million units globally in their first two days of availability, and tracking to become the fastest-selling games of all time for the handheld Nintendo 3DS.  Not bad for a franchise that got its start in 1996 on the Nintendo Game Boy handheld console. But the president of the Pokmon Company said the new games stay true to their roots of bringing people together to play while offering a new blueprint for the universe of pocket monsters.  "From the beginning, communication between players has been the primary goal for the Pokmon brand," Tsunekazu Ishihara told CNN. "Today, the ability to connect millions of people around the world via Wi-Fi is why launching 'Pokmon X' and 'Pokmon Y' simultaneously worldwide was an ambitious yet important goal."  Since debuting in video and card games, Pokemon has become a cultural phenomenon across the globe. There have been cartoons, cereals and a feature-length film, not to mention the national and global tournaments that draw thousands of players.  "Gotta catch 'em all" is the franchise's catch phrase, referring to the player's goal of catching and training the tiny monsters to compete against other players. That's gotten significantly harder, though, with the expansion to more than 700 different known creatures in the universe.  Unlike previous titles that were named after colors, "Pokmon X" and "Pokmon Y" represent a more analytical way of developing the games for The Pokmon Company and Nintendo. Ishihara said it required designers to understand that not all Pokmon gamers play for the same reasons.  "X and Y represent the X-axis and the Y-axis, but not in a scientific sense," he said. "Each person's thought process, though different, tends to intersect somewhere. I'd like to think this commonality or intersection occurs when people of diverse backgrounds play 'Pokmon X' and 'Pokmon Y' together."  Developers also included a new transformation ability called Mega Evolution. As Pokmon battle and gain experience, they evolve into stronger forms of themselves with improved skills and stats. Mega Evolution allows the creature to temporarily become stronger in battle.  Here's the catch: not all Pokmon can Mega Evolve.  "(This) requires players to use new strategies while they play, taking the brand to a new dimension," Ishihara said. "This is yet another reason we chose titles that were theoretical instead of names based on colors or precious stones."  Keeping the franchise fresh for fans while making it accessible to a new audience is important to Ishihara. Pokmon is the second-best-selling gaming franchise in the world, trailing only the "Mario" series.  Recognizing that its place in video game history is assured, Ishihara said new technology allows designers to do things with Pokemon they couldn't do in previous titles.  "Maintaining a balance of familiarity and innovation is important," he said. "Ever-evolving technology helps maintain that balance, because we can progress aspects of the game that people enjoy already and add things like new communication features that could only be imagined five, ten years ago."  "We feel this balance is key to the franchise's success and longevity. In 'Pokmon X' and 'Pokmon Y,' I think we do an excellent job of introducing the basics of the game to the player in a natural way, building their understanding step after step, all while ensuring the pacing allows the longtime fan to jump in and progress quickly to the more challenging portions of the gameplay."  The two new titles represent the franchise's first foray onto the Nintendo 3DS handheld console. The visual enhancements give players the opportunity to see their favorites move and interact in ways they never could before.  The technical abilities of the 3DS let players see their favorite moves and interactions in new ways, as well as play with other gamers around the world.  Ishihara said in late December that a new cloud service called Pokmon Bank would let players move their creatures back and forth between gamesa service fans have been asking for for many years.  "We have to stick to the core of the franchisethe collecting, battling and tradingwhile at the same time we have to take advantage of the new technology and the evolution of the hardware to expand on the aspect of communication," he said. "We also need to make sure that it's fun and rewarding to do each of these things. It's not an easy task."  Despite the advancements in technology, improvements to the look and intense level of fan interest, Ishihara believes that the franchise's simple, original goalto bring people togetherworks as well today as it did 17 years ago.  "The Pokmon universe is incredibly fun and diverse, and like the world we all live in, continues to surprise and excite us," he said. "I'm really excited to continue working to connect people in ways we only dreamed about when we first started. There is still so much to discover, so many Pokmon to find."  Gotta catch 'em all indeed.  
 Tokyo A seismic researcher told CNN Sunday that he warned the owner of the earthquake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant two years ago that the facility could be vulnerable to a tsunami.  The owner, Tokyo Electric Power Company, appeared to ignore the warning, said seismologist Yukinobu Okamura.  TEPCO has not responded to Okamura's allegation.  Okamura heads Japan's Active Fault & Earthquake Center. He said he told members of a TEPCO safety committee two years ago that data collected from layers of earth show that in the year 869 a massive tsunami devastated where the plant now is. The six-unit Fukushima Daiichi plant is located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo.  Without adequate safety measures, a repeat of the first millennium disaster at the site of a nuclear power plant could be far worse, Okamura said he told the committee then. He said he raised the issue because no one else did.  "I found that odd so I really wanted to speak out and let people know about it," Okamura said. "No one reacted in any way."  Instead, committee members discussed a 1938 earthquake in the region that killed only one person. Okamura said that is understandable because there was far more data available about that event. However, the power company should have considered the 869 tsunami, he said.  TEPCO representatives have held frequent press conferences since the March 11 earthquake triggered Japan's nuclear crisis. However, critics say direct questions rarely get direct answers from the company. That includes Okamura's allegation.  One critic is the Japanese government, which on Sunday pressed TEPCO for better information about the Fukushima Daiichi plant as it battled against criticism of its own handling of the crisis there.  Yukio Edano, the government's point man for the crisis, issued what he called "stronger instructions" to the Tokyo Electric Power Company to fully disclose as much as possible about conditions at the plant.  "Every piece of information must be provided accurately and swiftly" to Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, Edano, the chief Cabinet secretary, told reporters. "Without this communication, it's very difficult for the government to (establish) proper safety measures."  Workers have spent more than two weeks trying to stave off potential meltdowns in three reactors at the plant.  Edano said Tokyo Electric needs to be up-front with the Japanese peoplemillions of whom get power from the company, and millions more have been affected by radioactive emissions stemming from the crisis.  Tokyo Electric is Japan's largest utility. Both the company and the Japanese government have been criticized for failing to provide more detailed information about the situation at Fukushima Daiichi, one of three nuclear plants the company owns in northern Japan.  A poll by Japan's Kyodo News Agency found the government is getting poor marks for its handling of the crisis, with 58% telling pollsters that they disapprove. Though 57% of Japanese approve of how the government has moved to provide relief for victims of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, the poll found, only 39% approve of how it has managed the situation at Fukushima Daiichi.  Edano said the government has done "everything possible."  "But we also realize that many of the people in the affected areas have been very inconvenienced, and they are in a very serious crisis," he added. "We understand that, and there may be more such difficulties ahead."  Edano said Prime Minister Naoto Kan has been talking with local leaders "one by one" to find out what they need.  He declined to share details of those conversations, telling reporters, "We are simply focusing on providing better assistance for the residents."  Yukuiya Amano, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, returned to his native Japan shortly after the crisis erupted to press Kan for more information.  "In the beginning, we had some difficulty," Amano told CNN Sunday. "But I went to Tokyo and I talked to Prime Minister Kan and I asked him to facilitate the flow of information." Kan "promised me the highest level of transparency, and the flow improved," he said.  The government has ordered residents within a 20-kilometer (13-mile) radius to evacuate and those living from 20 to 30 kilometers to stay indoors. But levels of radioactivity above the levels considered safe for infants have turned up in drinking water as far south as Tokyo, and the anti-nuclear environmental group Greenpeace said Sunday that it had found high radiation levels in Iitate, a town of 7,000 about 40 kilometers northwest the plant.  Jan van de Putte, a radiation monitor for Greenpeace, said radiation levels ranged between .008 to 0.01 millisieverts per hour, or more than 50 times normal readings.  Though that's a dose far below the levels that would cause radiation sickness, it presents "a serious risk for developing cancer in the longer term," he told CNN.  "People living thereand there are still people living therewould exceed the maximum annual permitted dose in just a couple of days," van de Putte said. He said the town's mayor is seeking "practical, correct information" from the Japanese government.  "Without the right information, you cannot take the needed precautionary measures to protect yourself from radiation," he said. "We think that, to the population, is really important."  Noriyuki Shikata, a Kan spokesman, said the government understands the nuclear crisis has become "an issue of global attention."  Traces of radioactive iodine have been detected in China's Heilongjiang province, the U.S. state of Massachusetts and as far away as Sweden, authorities there announced over the weekend. None of those readings have been strong enough to harm public healthand the United States, Hong Kong and Russia have put restrictions on imports of food products from some regions of Japan.

	 'Pokmon X and Pokmon Y are the fastest-selling games of all'
Paul Pogba was the man Manchester United never wanted to losenow he's beginning to show why as he fired Juventus four points clear at the top of Serie A.  Pogba struck a 92nd minute winner to see off lowly Bologna and help Juve claim a 2-1 win to make it nine victories from ten league games.  The 19-year-old caused shockwaves after rejecting the chance to remain at Old Trafford and instead sign a four-year deal with the Italian club.  The horror of Heysel: Football's forgotten tragedy?  Fabio Quagliarella had given the home side a 54th minute lead only for Bologna to hit back through Saphir Taidi.  But Pogba fired home in stoppage-time to give his side all three points and help take advantage of Napoli's surprise defeat.  Napoli, who began the night in second, went down 1-0 at Atalanta, courtesy of Carlos Carmona's first-half strike.  That result allowed Inter Milan to move into third place after it came from behind to see off Sampdoria 3-2.  Gianni Munari had given Sampdoria a 20th minute lead but Diego Milito grabbed his 200th career goal to bring his side level.  Rodrigo Palacio and Freddy Guarin then put Inter in the driving seat and despite Eder grabbing a late consolation, the hosts held on to take the points.  Lazio was held to a 1-1 draw by Torino as it slipped to fourth but it sits four points clear of fifth place Fiorentina.  Parma moved up to sixth position following a 3-2 victory over Roma.  Ishak Belfodil scored and was sent off as the hosts came from behind to see off a Roma side, which had taken an early lead through Erik Lamela.  Belfodil equalised before Marco Parolo and Cristian Zaccardo put Parma 3-1 ahead with Francesco Totti's strike failing to bring Roma a reward.  Elsewhere, Cagliari overcame Siena 4-2, Chievo defeated Pescara 2-0 and Udinese was held to a 2-2 draw by Catania.  In Spain's Copa del Rey, Real Madrid carved out a 4-1 win away at Alcoyano.  Karim Benzema scored twice, while Kaka and Jose Rodriguez were also on target for the Spanish champions.  Champions League contenders Malaga was given a tough test by minnow Cacereo as it sneaked a 4-3 win.  Malaga's malady: When foreign ownership goes wrong  The Primera Liga giant had led 2-0 before the home side rallied to level before half-time.  Roque Santa Cruz's second of the night and a Duda strike appeared to have killed off Cacereo, which had Pablo Vargas sent off.  But the Segunda B side refused to give in and Carlos Esteve's 87th minute strike reduced the deficit to just a single goal going into the second leg.  There was no such problem for Atletico Madrid as it cruised to a 3-0 victory at ten-man Real Jaen.  Diego Costa, Adrian and Raul Garcia were on target for the visitors, while Dani Torres was sent off after just 26 minutes for Real.  Elsewhere, Las Palmas edged out Rayo Vallecano 1-0, while Real Zaragoza triumphed over Granada by the same scoreline.  Almeria recorded a two-goal advantage in its first leg after defeating Celta Vigo 2-0.  Bayern unbeaten run in Bundesliga halted by Bayer Leverkusen  In Germany's DFB Pokal, Bayern Munich cruised to a 4-0 win over Kaiserslautern thanks to two goals each from Claudio Pizarro and Arjen Robben.  
 Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemenal Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula strongly rebuked ISIS in a video released Friday, declaring ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate to be illegitimate.  The statement, delivered by one of AQAP's top clerics Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhariis a significant setback to ISIS efforts to assume leadership of the global jihadist movement a week after groups in Egypt and Libya joined the ISIS fold.  ISIS and al Qaeda's top leadership in Pakistan had a bitter falling out earlier this year, and al Qaeda and ISIS fighters have been fighting each other in Syria, but AQAP had until now stayed above the fray, calling for both sides to reconcile and pool resources to strike the United States.  But when al-Baghdadi declared  in an audiotape released last week his Islamic State had expanded to Yemen, as well as other Middle Eastern countries, it was too much for the AQAP leadership to stomach.  By claiming Yemen for his caliphate, al-Baghdadi had called into question the very right of AQAP to exist as a separate and autonomous jihadi group, leaving its leadership no choice but to push back.  "We did not want to talk about the current dispute and the sedition in Syria... however, our brothers in the Islamic State ... surprised us with several steps, including their announcement of the caliphate [and] they announced the expansion of the caliphate in a number of countries which they have have no governance, and considered them to be provinces that belonged to them," al-Nadhari stated, according to a translation by the SITE intelligence group.  "The announcement of the caliphate for all Muslims by our brothers in the Islamic State did not meet the required conditions," al-Nashari argued, because other jihadi groups were not consulted.  The cleric also criticized ISIS for "going too far in interpretations in terms of spilling inviolable blood under the excuse of expanding and spreading the power of the Islamic State."  And in a repudiation of al-Baghdadi's claim to supremacy among jihadis, he reaffirmed the group's pledge of allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar.  In forcing AQAP to publicly choose sides, al-Baghdadi appears to have badly miscalculated. AQAP leader Nasir al Wuhayshi, despite being named the number two of al Qaeda globally by al-Zawahiri last year, had been careful not to weigh in publicly on the dispute between al Qaeda and ISIS, restricting himself only to a poem he released in July praising his Egyptian boss.  In February, the general command of al Qaeda declared it had severed ties with ISIS because of its insubordination and its brutal tactics against fellow Muslims.  By then, Jabhat al Nusra, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, and ISIS were already fighting each other in parts of northern Syria. Although U.S airstrikes against both groups in recent weeks have led to ceasefires and some cooperation at the local level against moderate rebel groups, relations have remained tense.  AQAP divisions over ISIS  The AQAP leadership's rebuke of ISIS is not likely to go down well with all its members. Wuhayshi had avoided previously criticizing al-Baghdadi because he feared it might exacerbate divisions inside his own group. ISIS's rapid territorial expansion in Iraq and Syria electrified many jihadis in Yemen, and led to disagreements within the group.  "We have discussed that which resulted from the dispute and the infighting in Sham (Syria) with debate and argument ... however, we pardoned those who raised such issues," al-Nadhari acknowledged in the video released Friday.  Everything to know about the rise of ISIS  In January, one mid-level AQAP figure Mamoun Hatem tweeted his support for ISIS as its feud with al Qaeda heated up, prompting speculation of discord within its ranks.  This past summer, Abdul Majid al Raymi, a leading Yemeni Salafi-jihadi preacher long admired by AQAP, also came out in support for ISIS, asking his large number of followers in Yemen to do the same.  The U.S. air campaign against ISIS further boosted the popularity of ISIS in Yemeni jihadi circles, prompting AQAP to release a message of solidarity.  "Their blood is our blood, and their wounds are in our hearts, and supporting them is a duty upon us. Once we find a way to afflict America, we will follow it, Allah permitting," the group stated in a statement posted on Twitter on August 14, and translated by SITE.  Even in disagreement, respect  All this has made AQAP leaders tread carefully. Even in rebuking ISIS, AQAP's al-Nadhari was careful to refer to al-Baghdadi respectfully as "sheikh."  The cleric expressed hope that divisions between ISIS and Nusra could be healed and left the door open for fences to be mended between AQAP and ISIS if al-Baghdadi withdrew his fatwa claiming Yemen for his caliphate.  "We express our utmost joy to having received good news about what we heard of signs of stopping the infighting among the mujahideen in the Sham front [Syria]," al-Nadhari stated.  Despite the possibility of growing discord within AQAP, there are no signs of any immediate threat to Wuhayshi's leadership.  To date, no senior leader within AQAP has broken ranks and come out in favor of ISIS. Wuhayshi, by all accounts, remains exceptionally popular with the group's rank-and file-fighters, who have been energized by a call to arms to fight Shia Houthi fighters who recently took control of Sana'a.  But AQAP's rebuke of ISIS increases the chances of a splinter group emerging. Last week, a group calling itself Mujahideen in Yemen recorded a tape pledging loyalty to Baghdadi.  Egyptian terror group pledges alliance to ISIS  For ISIS, the rebuke by AQAP is a significant setback after recent wins elsewhere in the region in its jockeying with al Qaeda for pre-eminence in the global jihadi movement.  Last week, Ansar Beit al Maqdis, an increasingly powerful Egyptian group based in the Sinai, declared allegiance to al-Baghdadi, as did veteran Libyan ISIS fighters who have taken control of Derna, a major town in eastern Libya. Small splinter factions of the Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda in North Africa, as well as a group of fighters in Saudi Arabia, also declared their support.  The AQAP move may see the Yemeni group step up cooperation with Jabhat al Nusra in Syria. U.S. officials believe AQAP has shared sophisticated bomb-making technology with the Khorasan Group, a Nusra-linked outfit of veteran al Qaeda operatives plotting terrorist attacks against Western aviation.  The prospects of ISIS also receiving such bomb-making know-how from the Yemeni group appear to have dimmed.  Why ISIS is spreading across Muslim world

Music conductor Caroline Carson loves the sound of fighter jets.  Rushing to the window of her office at the University of New Orleans, where she directs the choral studies program, she saw the Blue Angels in the air practicing for an upcoming show.  Searching online later for more about their aircraft, she learned that Lockheed Martin was inviting Twitter users to apply to attend a ceremony marking the delivery of the last F-22 Raptor to the U.S. Air Force. Carson had only been Tweeting for about a year when her application was accepted to the Lockheed Martin "Tweet Up," which brought Twitter users together in May to tour the Georgia facility, meet and greet F-22 pilots, have free lunch and Tweet about the experience.  "I really felt connected to my father by going to this Air Force ceremony," said Carson, who traces her love of flying to her late father, who was a bomber pilot in World War II.  "I'm sitting on a plane and we take offand I know the science of flyingbut I still think 'how is this possible?' " said Carson, who also blogged about the experience. "Humanity has always looked toward the sky, and that's very human nature to look up."  Aviation enthusiasts like Carson aren't interested in your complaints about airline security or packed planes or high prices. To them, the thrill of flight has never gone away, and modern airline technology and design are more fascinating than ever.  One big change: No longer satisfied with simple snapshots of the newest Dreamliner for their photo albums or attending air shows or collectors' conventions, these enthusiasts are sharing their journeys online as they try to see and fly the newest airplanes, catch a glimpse of the latest in fighter plane technology or collect the most arcane aviation industry books or snacks. (Use the hashtag #avgeeks to find their postings online.) Sites range from one-man shops to businesses with paid staff and advertising.  "While air travel has become a chore for a lot of people, thanks mostly to the security hassles and airline fees, the fact that you can board a plane, get some sleep and wake up two continents away  for a reasonably affordable price  can all be traced back to the incredible underlying technology that allows an aircraft to run safely and efficiently for 14-20 hours a day, day in and day out," said Matt Molnar, editor of NYCAviation, an aviation website.  Airplane boneyard: Aviation geek lists 5 places worth a visit  "The mind-boggling logistics of running an airlinefrom scheduling all the pilots and flight attendants to getting catering trucks where they need to be to cleaning the lavatoriesare also pretty amazing to me," said Molnar, who grew up in Queens, New York, obsessed with the airline traffic taking off and landing at nearby LaGuardia and Kennedy airports.  Some sites like NYCAviation aim to be the news source for aviation worldwide. Simon Hradecky's Aviation Herald reports every aviation incident and accident that he can track. Matt Cawby's blog reports everything he can capture on video or via camera coming in and out of Boeing's Paine Field. The AMARC Experience explores the amazing aircraft collection at "the Boneyard," the Pentagon's 2,600-acre parking lot for about 5,000 retired military aircraft near Tucson, Arizona.  The place where dead airplanes come back to life  Have you seen the Boeing Dreamliner?  For some aviation enthusiasts, catching a glimpse of the newest planes, documenting their finds and sharing their photographs is what brings them joy. A top catch these days is the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which Paul McCarthy photographed during Boeing's "Dream Tour" stop in Sydney last month.  "Anything about aviation is exciting but the one thing that is really appealing is that change is the only constant," wrote McCarthy, community manager of Airliners.net, via e-mail from his home in Sydney. (Airliners.net hosts an active aviation community and includes a renowned collection of aviation photography.) "No matter what sector, there is always change and no matter what flight it is always different from the previous one. I can also go to the airport to photograph and be assured there will always be something different."  Still, access to a less-exciting Boeing 737-800 can still delight enthusiasts in the right context. Molnar, the NYCAviation editor, flew on a new Boeing 737-800 from the Boeing factory in Washington state to its new home in Rwanda.  "In the U.S. there are hundreds of 737s flying around and the average citizen doesn't blink an eye when American or Southwest receives a new one," said Molnar. "But in Rwanda there was practically a national celebration when we arrived to welcome their first factory-new aircraft."  Do you want a pool table or a trip to Jamaica?  Architect Mark Leininger credits his parents for choosing travel to China, Antigua, Colombia and other foreign destinations over material things throughout his childhood, instilling a love that has endured. Case in point: He remembers asking his mother for a pool table in third grade.  "Do you want a pool table or a trip to Jamaica?" she replied. He wisely opted for the travel, collecting the airline timetables that used to pile up at airport ticket counters in the pre-Internet era.  Back then, Leininger also constructed model airports and airplanes at home. Now he designs actual airports as associate director of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, including Boston Logan's international terminal. But he's still a superfan, happily collecting aviation industry books in many languages wherever he travels around the world and attending collectors' conferences when he can.  Writer Ryan Ver Berkmoes has loved traveling since he demanded the window seat on a flight to Chicagoat age 3. He also has a drawer filled with old timetables, and more recently, printed menus from his travels around the world as an author of Lonely Planet travel guidebooks.  "At age 6 my favorite place in the world was O'Hare airport where we would change planes," he said. "I was a little terror with my family, ordering them from, say gate E12 to F6 to make our connections and checking the black and white monitors all the way to make certain nothing had changed."  Despite the hassles of modern-day travel, "I still get a thrill when we surge down the runway to takeoff," said Ver Berkmoes. "I like anything that includes a feeling of movement. I'm a big fan of turbulence. (It) makes you feel like you're going somewhere."  Companies join the conversation  An aviation company can no longer roll a plane out of the factory or take it on a test flight in the middle of the night and not expect to be tracked by aviation enthusiasts. People are going to find out through Flight Aware, Cawby's blog or elsewhere.  "Why shouldn't we start the conversation and make people feel like they're part of something?" asked Boeing spokesman Doug Alder. "We're self-proclaimed aviation geeks, too."  Boeing hosts "Randy's Blog" which follows the world travels of a top Boeing marketing VP. It has also hosted three "Tweet Ups" to give aviation geeks an insider's view of Boeing and some company freebies. (The company now has four Twitter handles: @boeingairplanes, @boeingdefense, @boeingcareers and @boeing.)  It's the worldwide tour of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner that attracted thousands of new of aviation lovers to Boeing's Twitter handles, according to Alder. "We said when it was coming, when it was going, what it was doing while it was there," he said. "Even when events were not open to the public, we were able to give behind scenes images and take you there."  Perhaps one of aviation's more devoted bloggers is Cawby, who spends nearly 16 hours of almost every day outside Paine Field, the airport outside the Boeing factory in Everett, Washington. He records everything that comes out of the Boeing factory, gets video and pictures, and listens to radio traffic. A couple days ago, he said he rented a helicopter to get shots from the air of the airplanes below.  Surprisingly, he professes no love for aviation. He likes recording the news coming out of Paine Field and the fact that people like reading his blog and tweets. "There's an airplane factory here and there's brand new airplanes coming out and I get all of them," he said, speaking from his vantage point at Paine Field. "You can see everything here."  As if to prove his point, Cawby said he hasn't flown since 1972. He prefers to drive.  You told us: Top 5 spots for airplane geeks  
 Washington Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a key congressional voice on national security, announced Friday that he will not run for reelection this year.  The Michigan Republican made the announcement on Detroit's WJR radio station, saying he will host a syndicated radio program that will talk about national security issues and other news of the day.  "I had a career before politics and always planned to have one after," Rogers said in a statement. "The genius of our institutions is they are not dependent on the individual temporary occupants privileged to serve. That is why I have decided not to seek re- election to Congress in 2014."  Rogers, who has held a seat in Congress for more than a decade and is close to House Speaker John Boehner, has been a staunch supporter of National Security Agency surveillance programs, which came under fire after leaks by Edward Snowden publicly disclosed their sweeping nature.  This week, he and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Marylandthe top Democrat on the Intelligence Committeecame up with a plan for ending the NSA's sweeping collection of bulk telephone records.  Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA  Rogers has said in the past that the phone and electronic surveillance programs were not abused and has stridently criticized Snowden, a former NSA contractor.  He also has acknowledged public worries about government storage of surveillance data.  "That's really what we're trying to do here is alleviate that concern that there could be abuse in the future of these programs," Rogers said recently.  Authorization for those programs expires on Friday, but President Barack Obama is expected to seek their temporarily renewal while Congress works on reform legislation, a senior administration official said.  Rogers is also a favorite of Sunday public affairs programming on which he frequently criticizes Obama.  He joins a cadre of House members not seeking reelection in November, but his seat in the 8th Congressional District is still considered relatively safe for Republicans.  But the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report shifted their analysis of the district from "likely Republican" to "lean Republican" for the November election following Rogers' announcement.  Democrats sought to tie together Rogers and Boehner.  "Senior Republican committee chairmen continue to flee John Boehner's broken Congress rather than defend their indefensible record of siding with special interests over middle class families that has earned them record low approval ratings," Rep. Steve Israel of New York who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  Rogers became a key figure in developing U.S. national security policy, informed by his experience as an Army officer and FBI special agent.  U.S., other powers kick Russia out of G8  "Mike has spent his entire life ensuring our country has been kept safe from threats both foreign and domestic," National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden said in a statement. "He never once let partisan politics stand in the way of doing what's right for our nation and its safety. I can't think of anyone who enjoys more respect from both Republicans and Democrats alike."  Before Rogers became chairman, he issued an Intelligence Committee report "on Iran's nuclear ambitions, authored a bill to protect against chemical and biological threats, and co-authored legislation reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act," his Intelligence Committee biography said.  "Mike Rogers is as solid as they comeone of those patriots willing to go to the wall to keep the American people safe, no matter the strain or sacrifice," Boehner said in a statement.

The Obama administration has decided to release more than $1.6 billion in aid to Pakistan, a senior administration official said.  The official told CNN foreign affairs reporter Elise Labott that the decision was made because of improved relations over the past year.  Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was elected in May, is scheduled to meet President Barack Obama at the White House on Wednesday. "The visit will highlight the importance and resilience of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship," a White House statement said.  Tensions with Pakistan escalated after the U.S. military raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. Pakistan expelled some American military trainers, and some U.S. aid was halted that year.  The discovery of bin Laden in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, highlighted suspicions by American leaders that some Pakistani security forces may have collaborated with terrorists. Obama chose not to alert Pakistan's authorities before the U.S. raid.  Meanwhile, popular opinion in Pakistan has been inflamed by the U.S. incursion to kill bin Laden as well as U.S. drone strikes against suspected terrorists.  Sharif promised in his election campaign to try to improve relations with India, a rivalry that underlies the fears of Pakistan's security forces.  He was vague about terrorism and other issues of interest to the United States, but analysts said Sharif worked well with U.S. officials as Prime Minister during the 1990s.  
 Dareta, Nigeria In remote northern Nigeria, it is now a race against time to prevent a catastrophe in the world's worst-ever recorded outbreak of lead poisoning.  Officially 163 people have already died in Zamfara state111 of them children. But no one knows the true figures.  "You read about it in the literature but several hundred children have died here as a result of what happened here," says Ian von Lindern from the environmental engineering organization the Blacksmith Institute, which is heading the clean-up operation in the region.  Children began to die in January, but only now in June has the clean-up operation begun in the mud-hut village of Dareta.  Using the only tools availablecrude metal hoes normally used for farminglocal villagers are trying to clear the contaminated topsoil from the worst-affected housing compounds. Dug up, the soil is put into plastic bags and buried far from the village.  Young children look on as their friends and family wear unfamiliar white protective suits and face masks. And they inhale more of the stirred-up dust.  The U.S.-based Blacksmith Institutea global leader in pollution clean-up operationshas found disturbingly high levels of lead across the village.  "The fact that this is 10,000 parts per millionwhich is 1 percent leadthat's very high," explains Casey Bartram of the Blacksmith Institute.  In the U.S., the standard for residential-area soils is normally 400 parts per million.  "Because lead particles are so small, the levels so high, and because in this environment the kids are always in contact with the soilit's extremely dangerous for them to be exposed to levels like these," says Bartram.  The Blacksmith Institute currently is trying to help clean up a toxic lead site in Senegal where, in the last few years, 18 people died. Until now, it was the worst case of lead poisoning anyone had seen.  "We were asked if we'd come over and look at this [site] so we only planned on a four-day visitbut it's so bad we just have to stay and do what we can," says von Lindern.  Many of the men in the region are gold miners. They bring the metal ore mined from the local mines back to be crushed by their wives and children in their homes.  Unbeknownst to them, the gold ore contains extremely high levels of lead.  The ore processing has since been moved out of most of the villages and, in theory, the lead could be cleared away.  "I will instruct all the people to excavate their houses," the local chief, Mohammed Bello, declares.  "But it will be difficult to enforce because of poverty."  There are also many other problems. Just getting to Dareta village takes several hours' drivea journey that will soon be made almost impossible with the oncoming rains.  And with the rains coming, the young men working to clear away the contaminated earth are anxious to get to their farms.  Simba Terima of the Blacksmith Institute is helping train them in safely removing the contaminated soil.  "This is a local problem, this is not an international problem," he says. "So if they can own it, it'll be very good because long, long after we're gone they will be here."  It is hoped that Dareta village will be cleared in 26 days, but manpower is still lacking.  The local government, apart from handing out red election hats for an upcoming vote, is almost nowhere to be seen.  "I tell you that the problem has now been contained and we are now on remediation," explains Abubakar Maru, the local environmental commissioner.  "I'm sure these measures are good enough."  The government claims there have been no more fatalities since it first identified the problem as lead poisoning.  However, Dareta is only one of seven villages identified with extremely toxic levels of leadand the only village in the region receiving an on-going clean-up operation. From reports, some of the other villages are not being monitored properly. And there has been no thorough report on whether there are more villages suffering from the same toxic levels of lead.  "We hope to do just this village before the rainy season, but by mid-July there'll be so much rain we won't be able to, and we'll have to wait until October," says von Lindern.  "The kids will still be exposed."  On Sunday, the village cleared its first compound. For now, villagers are just taking it one home at a time.

Manchester United secured a vital 2-1 victory against Arsenal, their first on the road in the English Premier League this season under coach Louis Van Gaal.  Arsenal started much the brighter and could have been three nil up in the first thirty minutes, but poor finishing and an inform David de Gea in the Manchester United goal kept the scores level.  But United took control in the second half thanks to a Kieran Gibbs own goal and a late Wayne Rooney chip.  A stunning solo goal by Olivier Giroud, returning from a broken leg, gave Arsenal a glimmer of hope but United held on to move up to fourth place in the table.  "I think it is a very important victory," Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney told Sky Sports after the match.  "We weathered the storm and knew they were vulnerable to the counter attack. We rode our luck at times but our goalkeeper was fantastic."  Indifferent form  Both teams came in to the match having endured a subdued start to the season.  Whilst Manchester United remain in transition, having had three coaches in three seasons, Arsenal have also been playing far from their potential.  Yet it was Arsenal that started the game much brighter with Jack Wilshere in midfield and former United Striker Danny Welbeck carving out a number of chances.  But Wilshere and Welbeck could not find the back of the net. In fact, WIlshere was lucky to stay on the pitch after appearing to strike United midfielder Marouane Fellaini with his head.  United were content sitting back and hitting Arsenal on the break and it was against the run of play when they took the lead.  A hopeful cross from the left appeared to be of little trouble for the Arsenal defense. But, under pressure from the imposing Fellaini, Kieran Gibbs managed to first knock down his goalkeeper and then divert the subsequent shot into his own net past the prone Wojciech Szczesny, who was then replaced due to injury.  No way back  Arsenal probed in the minutes that followed but it was a poor quality game and when Angel di Maria was cut loose by Fellaini on the break, who in turn fed Rooney before he chipped the on rushing goalkeeper to make it 2-0, half of the Emirates Stadium had gone home.  Giroud's wonder goal deep in injury time gave Arsenal some hope but the full time whistle came soon enough, and with it a chorus of boos from the home crowd.  It has been a good week for Rooney, who played his 100th match for England midweek, scoring three times in two victories, before scoring again today. "It has been an indifferent start," he admitted after the game. "It has been a good week and I hope now we can go on a good run of games. Today was a massive result."  Chelsea roll on  Chelsea continued their unbeaten run this season with an easy victory against West Brom. Early goals from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard, followed by a red card for West Brom's Claudio Yacob, effectively ended the contest before half time. Chelsea are now seven points clear of second place Southampton, who play Monday.  Meanwhile, Manchester City kept up their chase of Chelsea by beating Swansea City 2-1. But City had to come from behind to do so. Wilfred Bony scored within the first ten minutes for the Swans before goals from Steven Jovetic and Yaya Toure secured a much needed win.  
 LOS ANGELES, California Doctors gave Anna Nicole Smith a long list of dangerous drugs over the three years before her death, including while she was pregnant, according to sworn statements by investigators from state agencies.  Dosages prescribed to Anna Nicole Smith were "dangerously high," a drug expert says in an affidavit.  Two doctors charged in connection with Smith's death allegedly also crossed professional lines by having personal relationships with their patient, the court documents released Tuesday said.  Smith died in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, of what was later ruled to be "acute combined drug intoxication."  One affidavit quoted a pharmacist who refused to fill a prescription written for Smith as saying he warned one doctor he would not give her the drug "unless you want your picture on the front page of the National Enquirer."  One investigator described the former Playboy model and reality show TV star as a "drug seeker."  Her boyfriend, Howard K. Stern, and two doctorsDr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoorwere charged with several felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007.  All three defendants entered not-guilty pleas in May. A preliminary hearing is set for next month in the case.  Smith, whose real name was Vickie Lynn Marshall, "was given drugs in excessive amounts," according to a medical expert consulted and quoted by a state medical board investigator.  Dr. Jill Klessig also told an investigator that "in addition to the prescribing issues, there appears to have been a personal relationship" between Smith and the two doctors that crossed the boundaries of professionalism.  The affidavit references a video clip of Kapoor "kissing and snuggling" with Smith "in a reclined position in a nightclub setting."  Eroshevich traveled to the Bahamas to visit Smith and was with her for four days in Hollywood, Florida, four days before her death, an investigator said in an affidavit.  The doctor personally visited a Burbank, California, pharmacy in September 2006 to get a sleep aidchloral hydratefor Smith to use in the Bahamas. It was just four days after Smith gave birth to a daughter in Nassau.  "I wouldn't give her chloral hydrate unless you want your picture on the front page of the National Enquirer," pharmacist Steve Mazlin told Eroshevich, according to the affidavit.  The affidavit from Jon Genens, a senior investigator with the California medical board, detailed dozens of prescriptions written for Smithunder several aliasesfor a long list of narcotics and sleep aids.  Genens said even during the time she was pregnantstarting in January 2006Kapoor prescribed an average of 10 tablets of Methadone per day for Smith. He noted that Kapoor lowered the dosage in the last three months of her pregnancy.  The volume of dangerous drugs being ordered by doctors spurred the chief pharmacist at the store where most of the prescriptions were filled to call a drug expert for advice in late 2006, according to a sworn statement by California Department of Justice Special Agent Jennifer Doss.  Dr. Greg Thompson told Doss he recalled the dosages were "dangerously high."  "Dr. Thompson stated they might work for a drug addict under supervised care, or with a dying cancer patient in a hospital, or 'if you were going to kill someone,' " Doss said. Thompson told Doss he later "admonished Dr. Eroshevich" about the drugs she was requesting for Smith.  "Dr. Thompson stated Dr. Eroshevich was obviously not familiar with a lot of medications she was prescribing for ... Smith," Doss said in her affidavit.  The Doss affidavit said the doctor used Smith's boyfriend as a cover to get the prescriptions filled.  "Of the 12 medications found in Anna Nicole Smith's hotel room at the time of her death, seven medications were prescribed the name of Howard K. Stearn [believed to be Howard K. Stern] by Dr. Eroshevich," Agent Doss said.  The drugs were apparently personally delivered to Smith in the Bahamas and Florida by her doctor, Doss said.  "It is reasonable to believe that Dr. Eroshevich provided Anna Nicole Smith prescription medications and controlled substances by transporting them from California to Nassau, Bahamas with her on her travels to visit Anna Nicole Smith," Doss said.

Syrian security forces were commanded to shoot unarmed protesters, according to military and security agency defectors interviewed by a human rights watchdog.  Human Rights Watch said Saturday that they "described receiving, and following, orders to shoot on protesters to disperse them."  Efforts to reach the Syrian government for comment were not immediately successful.  The group said they interviewed eight soldiers and four members of the security agencies in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan who defected over the last four months of anti-government protests.  "The testimony of these defectors provides further evidence that the killing of protesters was no accident but a result of a deliberate policy by senior figures in Syria to use deadly force to disperse protesters," Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, quoted in the report.  "Syrian soldiers and officials should know that they too have not just a right but a duty to refuse such unlawful orders, and that those who deliberately kill or injure peaceful protesters will be subject to prosecution."  The claims coincide with ongoing assertions by Syrian activists that security personnel have assaulted unarmed protesters. The Syrian regime claims armed groups are responsible for the violence at the demonstrations, which erupted nationwide in mid-March.  There was a flurry of deaths on Friday during nationwide protests. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said 1,410 civilian and 348 members of army and security forces have been killed over the last four months.  The people interviewed "participated in the government crackdown in Daraa, Izraa, Baniyas, Homs, Jisr al-Shugur, Aleppo, and Damascus" and witnessed "the shooting and injury of dozens of protesters, and the arbitrary arrest and detention of hundreds."  All of those interviewed defectors said "their superiors had told them that they were fighting infiltrators (mundaseen), Salafists, and terrorists. The defectors said they were surprised to encounter unarmed protesters instead, but still were ordered to fire on them in a number of instances," a Human Rights Watch report said.  "The defectors also reported that those who refused orders to shoot on protesters ran the risk of being shot themselves. One of the defectors reported seeing a military officer shoot and kill two soldiers in Daraa for refusing orders."  The United States and other countries have denounced Syria's tough crackdown on peaceful protests, and a visit to the restive city of Hama by the U.S. ambassador to Syria this week has drawn sharp criticism from the Bashar al-Assad regime.  Government officials said Ambassador Robert Ford incited protest in Hama, a claim called "absolute rubbish" by State Department's spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Syrian officials also claimed he didn't get proper permission to travel, an assertion also disputed by the United States.  Hama has been the scene of large anti-government demonstrations and a crackdown this week by government forces.  Syria's minister of Islamic Endowments was the latest to denounce Ford's presence in Hama, saying it was "without prior permission considering that it was primarily intended to incite bloodshed and ruin the contacts designed to stop bloodshed and eliminate sedition," according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency.  Citing remarks of Abdul-Sattar al-Sayyed, SANA said the "U.S. ambassador wants Jerusalem to be an eternal capital of Israel, adding that the U.S. has always been against Arabism, Islam and values."

 Some of the strongest support for health care cooperatives' place in the national effort to reform the nation's health care system comes from those who experience a co-op's care every day: doctors and patients.  Co-op patient Norman Nistler says he didn't even realize he was a part of a health care co-op.  Co-ops are non-profit organizations, so any money that is earned goes back to be used on patients and other costs. Patients also elect a governing board, which is in stark contrast to operations under private health insurance plan.  Proponents point to two co-ops as evidence they are an alternative in the health care reform debate: HealthPartners in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, Washington.  HealthPartners has been in business for half a century and served more than a million people in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Some decades-long members said they didn't know they were with a co-op.  "I watch a lot of it on television now. There's a lot of talking about co-ops, but I didn't realize this was a co-op," said patient Norman Nistler.  The co-op was able to save millions, officials note, by switching to generic drugs and cutting tobacco use among its members by double the Minnesota state average because doctors help patients to quit.  Darla Andrews, a patient at the co-op, said she and her doctor have easy access to her records. "It's all digital, so it works out good for me. It's more convenient."  Dr. Eric Seaver, who works at Group Health.  "We can communicate with patients through secure e-mail for routine questions or concerns that in the private world physicians often aren't able or won't do because there's just no motivation to do that. There's no reimbursement. ... Here with Group Health's model, it's all about providing patients the care that they need when they need it in a form that works best for them."  Group Health lists Microsoft and Starbucks as organizations that use its system.  "I have great contact with the doctors," said Group Health member Dave Jacobs. "I'm treated like a person, not a number."  "My care has been absolutely exceptional. And that's because I believe I'm going to a private medical facility, dealing with doctors one-on-one and not a bureaucrat," he said.  "Part of the great value in that structure is that our patients are actively engaged, not just in the organization and governance but actively engaged in finding ways to engage themselves in their care itself," said Scott Armstrong, president and CEO of Group Health Cooperative. "We all know that an engaged patient leads to a better health outcome. So much of health care is actually the responsibility of us as individuals."  Aaron Katz, of the University of Washington Health Services, says the group health model could be viable nationally, but only if there are tougher restrictions on insurance companies. The reason co-ops are successful, he says, is because they employ their own doctors, specialists, pharmacies and can reduce the amount of tests and procedures that drive up costs.  Seaver says his co-op emphasizes evidence-based medicine and making decisions in patient care based upon "the best evidence that we have available for what's effective and what is ineffective."  "I think what we're finding in this model is doing the right thing for the patient is the best thing not just for the patient but also for the system as a whole," he said.  "I feel like I'm able to practice medicine the way I had envisioned back in medical school."  Working at Group Health "has been a breath of fresh air for my career," he said.  CNN's Dana Bash, Ed Hornick, Lesa Jansen, Chris Welch and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.

Serena Williams maintained her dominance of Denmark's former world number one Caroline Wozniacki with a typical fightback in the quarterfinals of the Rogers Cup in Montreal.  Williams has only lost once to Wozniacki in eight meetings, back in 2012, but looked in danger of a rare defeat when she trailed a set and 4-2.  The world number one fell 15-30 on her next service game before hammering home one of her 15 aces of the day on the way to a run of 10 straight points to level at 4-4.  A further break of service saw Williams take the second set and she led 2-0 and 4-2 in the decider.  Wozniacki, who was playing some of her best tennis of the year, twice leveled but the top seed pulled ahead again to close out the match 4-6 7-5 7-5 in two hours 41 minutes.  It was to set up a semifinal match with her elder sister Venus, who later also came from a set down to beat Carla Suarez Navarro.  The Spaniard had put out Maria Sharapova in the last 16 and she led Williams a set and 2-0 before the seven-time grand slam champion hit back.  She won 10 of the next 11 games to go 4-1 up in the decider and although Navarro briefly rallied she was always trailing.  Venus eventually closed it out 4-6 6-2 6-3 in two hours 11 minutes to earn her 25th career match up with Serena, who leads 14-10 in wins.  At the men's Rogers Cup tournament, the Masters 1000 event in Toronto, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga continued his fine run with a three-set victory over former Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.  13th seed Tsonga had won the first set on a tiebreak, but after Murray had leveled at one set all, the Frenchman trailed 0-3 in the decider and looked set to go out.  However, he rallied to win six of the next seven games to reach the semifinals.  Tsonga, who beat top seed Novak Djokovic in the previous round, will take Bulgaria's rising your star Grigor Dimitrov for a place in the final.  Dimitrov, the seventh seed, accounted for South Africa's Kevin Anderson in a marathon three-setter 5-7 7-5 7-6.  
 Sixteen people have been killed and five others injured in a fire early Wednesday at a market in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, the local government said.  About 145 firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze, which charred an area of more than 1,000 square meters (10,800 square feet), the local government said in a post on Weibo, a Twitter-like service in China.  The blaze started around 1 a.m. Wednesday, the state news agency Xinhua reported. Later in the morning, firefighters were still clearing away the embers and searching for survivors in the debris, the agency said.  There was no immediate mention of the cause of the fire.  The Rongjian Farmers' Market is a venue for farm produce wholesalers in Gongming New District of Shenzhen, according to Xinhua.

Two tech companies are offering a free tool to defeat sophisticated malicious software that criminals have used to extract millions of dollars in ransom payments from small businesses and other computer owners.  The software from FireEye and Fox IT can help victims decrypt files that were locked by the malware Cryptolocker.  The scheme typically worked this way: Victims would click a seemingly legitimate email, which automatically downloaded the malware on their computers.  Upon infection, victims would lose access to their files and criminals would demand payment in order to regain access.  The Justice Department announced in June it had taken down the Cryptolocker malware.  The malware remains defunct, but there are many victims whose files were locked by criminals and remain held hostage.  Since emerging in 2013, Cryptolocker has been used to attack about 200,000 computers, half of which were in the United States. In its first two months, criminals extorted an estimated $27 million from victims.  David Hickton, the U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh whose office led the investigation, said in June that Cryptolocker victims included the police department in Swansea, Massachusetts.  It paid a ransom to cyber criminals to restore access to its files after its systems were infected.

 Wichita, Kansas At a table in Caffe Moderne, a coffee bar in downtown Wichita, sat a couple of young Kansans sipping coffee and working away on Macbook Pros. Terms like "content management systems" and "web integration" floated in the air as Clint Brauer taught a local about his business.  Thirteen years ago, Brauer couldn't wait to get out of the Sunflower State. "I just didn't see the opportunities in Kansas," he said. "I grew up in a small town outside of Wichita, went to Kansas State ... and so I moved to the West Coast to get into high tech."  Brauer traveled from the prairie to the Hollywood Hills and spent his 20s living the kind of life he'd fantasized about while growing up in the small town of Haven.   "It was a really exciting time. Life was about work." Brauer worked, made a career in consulting, and became the managing editor of Cyberread, an e-book company.  The coasts have always held a great deal of appeal for techies. Los Angeles and San Francisco, California, and New York and Washington are hubs for the young and cyber-savvy.  100 best places to live  A generation of young workers flocked there at the turn of the millennium, drawn by job opportunities and the fast-paced lifestyle that the big cities provide. But the priorities of a 30-year-old can be dramatically different from those of a 20-something.   "I started realizing that while I loved what I did, I wanted more balance. My goal wasn't to become the CEO of a Fortune 500 company anymore but to have a better quality of life." A change was coming for Brauer, and fortunately the Web would provide.  "I'm OK that I don't have three different Cuban restaurants to choose from," he jokes. "Some folks couldn't deal with it, but I like going out to the country, going out to the lake, and enjoying the open skies."  Not surprisingly, salaries in the heartland's Silicon Prairie are generally lower than California's Silicon Valley or New York's Silicon Alley.   The average salary for software engineers in New York City is $97,370; in California, it's $109,000. In Kansas, the average salary for the job is $85,000, according to federal stats. But if you factor in the Midwest's dramatically lower cost of living, the possible benefits become clear.   "As high technology has become more interwoven with everything in our lives, there are bits and pieces of these industries in virtually every city," said Mark Vitner, an economist with Wells Fargo. "We're getting to the point now that the jobs are spreading out across the country from Silicon Valley and New York."  The next Silicon Valley? It may be New York  Midwestern tech is coming into its own. Jeff Slobotski produces an event called Big Omaha that includes more than 500 of the region's workers from Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and Iowa. The annual event just took place in May.  "We've got a real healthy and growing community," said Slobotski, innovation director at the AIM Institutea nonprofit membership organization for IT leadership.  Recent jobs for developers, coders for backend structures, as well as traditional corporate IT jobs have been filled recently by workers from the coasts, he said.   Slobotski, who runs a blog called "Silicon Prairie News" said high-tech talent and ideas are thriving in the region many coastal residents snidely refer to as "flyover country." Some of the newer companies in Nebraska include Agile Sports/ Hudl in Lincoln, and Hayneedle.com and Rockdex in Omaha.  Biotech and green-tech industries are "still in the discovery stage," he said. "People are talking about how to grow that."  In Silicon Valley, longtime human resources executive Aryae Coopersmith of HR Forums has noticed a change in the past year.   "Now that the economy is waking up a little bit and there's more hiring, our members have shifted from few concerns about retaining employees to new concerns about retaining employees," said Coopersmith. The work-life balance in middle America could be more appealing, and there are benefits to being a bigger fish in a smaller pond.  A lot of the growth is spurred on by people like Brauer, who returned to Kansas with a decade of experience and a phone full of business contacts.  "I'd been sourcing people from all over the world for the last decade, so working for them didn't necessitate being in L.A."   The nature of the new economy and the technological advances of the past ten years meant that he could be based anywhere and work for clients worldwide.   "I remember one day sitting on a tractor at my parents' and needing to be on a conference callwith clients in India. I turned down the motor, and since I had good cell service, I did it right there."  "Business is going fine, it can be done. It's a little bit more difficult to grow your business but your costs are so low [in Kansas], your personal burn rate is much lower," said Brauer. "I'm at peace out here."

Editor's note: On CNN's "State of the Union," host and Chief National Correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country.  Herbert Hale lives on a check of a little less than $17 a week and whatever he can pick up from odd jobs.  CHERRY CREEK, South Dakota The tiny one-room house rests on a hill; no electricity and no running water. A creaky metal cot and a rusting wood-burning stove is all the comfort Herbert Hale says he needs.  "All it is is logs, gluedirt and water put togetherthen cement and the chicken string," Hale says of his home. "Long as the windows don't break, it's nice and warm in here."  The roof leaks a bit, and the floorboards are rotted in one corner, but Hale isn't one to complain.  "It's home," he says, almost under his breath, as he invites a visitor to have a look.  Firewood is stacked in one corner inside, and more outside as Hale uses the summer months to stockpile for prairie winters, where 20 below zero is not all that uncommon.  He also pulls bunches of long weeds in the prairie grass, to dry for use as a firestarter.  "I have to be careful," Hale says matter-of-factly as he pulls a few fistfuls. "Sometimes there are some snakes. Rattlesnakes. Nothing to mess around with."  He is 54 years old, a member of the Lakota tribe and part of two stunning statistics, even as communities across America deal with the pain and challenges of recession:  Hale worked 16 years as a firefighter. But he began having some back problems in the early 1980s and then, "cancer caught up with me. I have a brain tumor."  He says he gets a check for just shy of $17 every week from a tribal welfare fund, and tries to find odd jobs to pay for his food and to help out a diabetic sister.  But there's a catch: Tiny Cherry Creek has no such jobs. There are one or two one-room homes like Hale's, but it is mostly a collection of a couple dozen simple modular homes provided by a federal and tribal housing program. It doesn't even have a gas station or general store.  So Hale heads out most days toward Eagle Butte17 miles up one road and then 21 miles more up the next. A few more twists and, "It's about 42 to 43 miles, someplace around there."  Herbert Hale can't afford a car.  "Well, I take off, go to my sister's, then get some water and take off. Somebody along the way will pick me up."  Often, that somebody is Bryce In The Woods, a member of the tribal council whose district includes Cherry Creek.  "It is bad," he says of the area's economic plight, walking a visitor through the gravel streets where many residents, idle because of the lack of jobs, are sitting out front or shout out a greeting from inside their small homes.  To spend a day crossing the reservation is to see a place stunningly beautiful and seemingly forgotten all at once, small, poor communities tucked into the hollows of western South Dakota's Cheyenne River Reservation. The poverty is all the more striking because of the richness of the setting: green and golden rolling hills, roaming horses and cattle, and tall corn and golden sunflowers sprouting from the fertile soil.  "Ziebach County is the No. 1 county statistically with child poverty," he said. "Now that alone is generational, with the trauma of poverty and the broken family."  Breaking that cycle is Bryce In The Woods' obsession. He highlights a bright spot: A building in the community converted to a makeshift classroom and library where residents can get tutoring help and then take the GED --- the high school equivalency exam.  "It is so difficult," he says of the challenge facing younger reservation residents. "Some of our young people join the services, the armed services, some of them go to college or apply to college," Bryce In The Woods told us. "The majority, if they are staying here, end up moving to Rapid City or some of the bigger cities to try to find employment."  In Eagle Butte, the largest community on the reservation, a bustling construction site is a new source of pride.  A medical center is under construction, thanks to funding from the Obama administration's stimulus plan, and Bryce In The Woods says about 65 construction-related jobs so far have gone to tribal members.  "At this point I am very appreciative of what we have received," Joseph Brings Plenty, the elected tribal chairman, says when we ask if the stimulus funding is enough. "But as far as expectation, I can say no. There would be a lot more need to be fulfilled by the U.S. government for our tribe before I can say yes."  Outside, Brings Plenty's office is a "First Americans for Obama" signa reminder the tribe was an early backer of Barack Obama. Brings Plenty says he hopes the president remembers.  "I can sympathize, empathize, with the demands, with the pressures that are on his shoulders, on his plate and put in front of him," Brings Plenty said during a break from a Tribal Council meeting.  The biggest help Obama and Congress could give, the chairman and others told us, is greater water rights. The tribe has money for more housing, but can't build because the water pressure is too low and its treatment systems too outdated to handle increased demand.  "I feel that we are forgotten because we don't have that voice out there," Chairman Brings Plenty said. "It's demoralizing in a way for some of our members that go out and receive an education and come back and are unable to get a job here."  To be clear, Chairman Brings Plenty and Bryce In the Woods say not all of the tribe's problems rest with the federal government.  Both mentioned obstacles and disagreements born of factional tribal politics and rivalries, which were in full evidence during just a few minutes of the Tribal Council's debate.  In The Woods is also a strong advocate for land reforms he says would get the tribe a better deal for grazing rights on its property.  Still, they would welcome more economic development help, from the state and from Washington, but say their voices don't always get heard, even in the best of times.  "When it comes down to a vote, a lot of the urban representatives, I don't think they really know the plight on the reservation," Bryce In the Woods said. "I think there is a stereotype out there that all tribes have casinos and that's not true."  Herbert Hale shrugs when asked if Washington has a responsibility to help his struggling community.  "I can't really say," he said quietly. "I'm not into politics to tell you the truth. I was when I was younger, back in the '80s."  Now, he lives the simplest of lives.  A few hours of work if he is lucky, and perhaps an hour or two collecting wood, even in the scorching August sun. The temperature neared 100 degrees on the day of our visit, yet Hale's wood stove was warm to the touch. Prairie mornings can still be chilly.  More important, memories of winter's past remind Hale of the value of his growing stockpile.  "Sometimes it's a long walk," he says. "Especially in February. Twenty below and I have to walk. Often no cars ... A few times I felt like falling asleep on the road. I told myself, 'Fall asleep, you're froze and you're gone.' I pushed myself to keep walking."  Once home, he has a battery-powered radio and uses a small kerosene lamp to pass time at night reading. He's extra careful because he recently broke its glass chimney, so the flame burns without protection from the winds that can pick up suddenly.  Herbert's worries are more immediate than whether the president or any other politician understands his plight. "They never stopped up here," he says."If they did, I wasn't home."  On the odd jobs in town, $1 here and $5 there adds upnot too much, but his goals are modest.  "You know, take the trash out. I sweep the front. A few dollars a day wouldn't hurt. That's as good as you need. That's all I care about. One day at a time."  
 A dramatic injury-time goal by Juan Mata handed Chelsea a 2-1 victory over Wigan in the English Premier League on Saturday to boost their chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League.  All three goals came in the second half with Branislav Ivanovic opening the scoring Chelsea in the 62nd minute.  Wigan's French midfielder Mohamed Diame looked to have salvaged a point for the second-from-bottom side when he scored in the 82nd minute.  But Juan Mata's goal which came after Fernando Torres' shot hit the post saw the Blues rise to fifth, now two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal.  Tottenham Hotspur moved up to third place with a 0-0 draw against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light but Arsenal can overtake them again if they get a result against Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.  League leaders Manchester United are also in action Sunday as they host Queens Park Rangers.  Liverpool's lacklustre form continues as they drew 1-1 at Anfield against Aston Villa.  Should Liverpool sack Kenny Dalglish?  Chris Herd gave the visitors the lead in the 10th minute before Luis Suarez rescued a point for Kenny Dalglish's side eight minutes from the end.  The point lifts Liverpool to eighth with 43 points. Villa remain in 15th place with 34 points.  Blackburn Rovers went down to West Bromwich Albion 3-0 at The Hawthorns to remain in the bottom three.  The win sees West Brom climb to 12th.  Norwich City and Everton drew 2-2 at Carrow Road while Bolton Wanderers suffered a heavy home defeat going down 3-0 to Fulham.  Wolverhampton Wanderers now look certain to be relegated after a 2-1 defeat to Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium.  Peter Crouch claimed the winner which sees Stoke rise to 11th. Wolves remain bottom, six points from safety with just six games remaining.

After the surprisingly harsh response from some conservatives to my statement honoring President Nelson Mandela, I replied last week with a question to his critics: What would you have done, in his place, faced with a crushing apartheid regime determined to eliminate all rights for your race?  Mandela, I pointed out, was fighting for the same freedoms we in America defend most forcefully. Those who don't want to honor him seem to judge by a double standard.  These critics on the right, however, are a relatively minor group. We heard no major conservative leaders or publications repeating their misguided claims.  Compare that with the crass manner in which the mainstream left has seized on Mandela's death to smear Ronald Reagan as having somehow "embraced" apartheid.  Many of the Mandela remembrances have noted Reagan's veto of economic sanctions against South Africa as well as the State Department's addition of the African National Congress to the terrorist listsaying this proves Reagan supported apartheid.  As someone who at the time was immersed in the debate over South Africa as a member of Congress, I can attest that this is a slanderous mischaracterization of the Reagan policy.  Reagan's chief concern in South Africa was to prevent the country from falling to communism, a priority in line with his chief foreign policy goal worldwide. But Reagan was also part of a new generation of conservatives who were committed to confronting apartheid after decades of what was frankly a disappointing lack of courage on the American right.  A few dozen Republicans in Congress, I among them, were some of the first conservatives to approach the problem seriously. The climax of our effort in the House was passing economic sanctions against South Africa. As many liberal commentators have noted in the past few days, Reagan vetoed that bill, only to have Congress override his veto.  But Reagan's critics are wrong to say his opposition to economic sanctions made him pro-apartheid. He disagreed with our group of activist Republicans in Congress over tactics, not over the aim of ending the institution. The President was absolutely committed to that goal, even if some of our other conservative colleagues were not.  Reagan "detested" apartheid, as he wrote in his diary and said publicly, but thought sanctions would be counterproductive to ending it. In particular, he believed punishing South Africa economically would only have "hurt the very blacks we're trying to help." This was a position Reagan shared with Gatsha Buthelezi, the head of the Zulus, among other black South Africans.  Our disagreement over sanctions, as Reagan said in his remarks after the veto override, "was not whether or not to oppose apartheid but, instead, how best to oppose it and how best to bring freedom to that troubled country."  Reagan's veto of that bill, moreover, was not the sum total of his record on the issue. For one thing, as his former speechwriter Peter Robinson recalled last week, "Reagan himself imposed sanctions against the South African government, issuing an executive order that curtailed military and official relations between the U.S. and Pretoria." These steps hurt the racist regime directly, not the poor majority.  In addition to his own sanctions, one of the president's first foreign policy steps was to send a close aide, William Clark, to South Africa to oppose apartheid. There, as four Reagan biographers wrote recently in The Washington Post, "an unsmiling Clark told Prime Minister Pieter W. Botha to his face that the new president and administration 'abhorred apartheid,' " and ended up walking out on him.  Reagan later appointed Edward Perkins as the first U.S. black ambassador to South Africa, a move that from the perspective of the apartheid regime was highly provocative. In fact, it infuriated Botha. Perkins later recounted that when he presented his credentials to the prime minister, the white South African was shaking in anger. The only modern equivalent might be appointing a woman ambassador to Saudi Arabia.  Reagan was not silent about the imprisonment of Mandela, either. He argued in a 1986 speech that "Nelson Mandela should be released to participate in the country's political process" and counted this step as a "necessary component of progress toward political peace." This is not the record left-wing pundits looking to smear Reagan have been presenting.  There were too many Republicans who were on the wrong side of the apartheid issue. Despite those who are abusing the death of a peacemaker to indulge their hatred of another former president, Ronald Reagan was not among them.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.  
 A worldwide Jewish rights organization is pushing Hungarian authorities to prosecute a man it claims is a Nazi war criminal, recently discovered in Budapest, Hungary, who allegedly sent more than 15,000 Jews to Auschwitz in the spring of 1944.  The Simon Wiesenthal Center found Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary as part of its "Last Chance" project, said Efraim Zuroff, director of the center's Israel office.  The center cooperated with British tabloid The Sun to photograph Csizsik-Csatary, who reportedly is 97, and ask him questions, Zuroff said. "We're the ones who found him; they're the ones who photographed him."  Csizsik-Csatary served as a senior Hungarian police officer in the city of Kosice, which is now in Slovakia but was under Hungarian rule in the 1940s, the center said. He topped the Wiesenthal Center's 2012 list of most wanted Nazi war criminals.  "He was a commander of a ghetto," Zuroff told CNN.  Report: Hitler ordered reprieve for Jewish man  Csizsik-Csatary participated in the deportation of 15,700 Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944, witnesses have told the center. He also played a role in "deportations to the Ukraine to be killed300 Jews," Zuroff said.  "We found eyewitnesses on three different continents," Zuroff said. Those witnesses told the center about Csizsik-Csatary's cruelty to Jewish detainees and his role in the deportations to Auschwitz and Ukraine.  Confronted by a Sun reporter, Csizsik-Csatary denied the allegations, the tabloid reported Sunday.  A witness to the August 1941 Ukraine deportations had nine family members who were deported, he told CNN. Csizsik-Csatary made sure four of them were brought back from forced labor with the Hungarian army so they would be deported and killed, according to Zuroff.  During the Auschwitz deportations, Csizsik-Csatary "forced these girls to dig a ditch with their handsyoung Jewish girls." Two of the center's witnesses were survivors of that deportation, he said.  According to The Sun, which cited documents released by the Wiesenthal Center, Csizsik-Csatary beat Jewish women with a whip he carried on his belt.  "A variety of factors" led to the center's locating Csizsik-Csatary in Budapest, Zuroff said. "He wasn't hiding under a false name. ... He had no reason to fear."  Using the last name Csizsik, Csizsik-Csatary arrived in Canada in 1949, telling immigration officials he was Yugoslavian, according to The Toronto Star newspaper.  A spokeswoman for Canada's Department of Justice, Carole Saindon, said Monday that "It was alleged that when applying to immigrate to Canada, (Csizsik-Csatary) provided false information about his nationality, and failed to provide information concerning his collaboration with Nazi occupation forces while serving with the Royal Hungarian Police. It was further alleged that he participated in the internment and deportation of thousands of Hungarian Jews to concentration camps. As a result, the government of Canada revoked his citizenship on August 28, 1997.  As deportation proceedings were under way, Csizsik-Csatary voluntarily left the country, Saindon said in an e-mail to CNN.  In October 1997, Paul Vickery, head of the Canadian Justice Department's war crimes unit, told Radio Free Europe that when officials went to Csizsik-Csatary's Toronto home, his daughter told them he was living in Europe. Vickery told the network Csizsik-Csatary's name would be placed on a watch list and he would be barred from re-entering Canada.  Csizsik-Csatary initially denied the allegations and asked the Canadian government to put the case on trial, but later withdrew that request, The Toronto Star reported in August 1997.  "In his statement of defense, Csizsik-Csatary admitted to some involvement in the ghettoization of Jews, to handing over at least two Jews to the Germans and to attending the last mass deportation of Jews out of Kassa (Hungary)," the Star said.  The Sun said in its Sunday report that Csizsik-Csatary's attorneys claimed he did not know where the Jews were being sent. Of the 12,000 Jews transferred from a ghetto to a brickyard and deported, only 450 survived, the Sun reported.  Csizsik-Csatary returned to Hungary upon leaving Canada, Zuroff said. "Hungarian authorities knew that he was back," he said. Authorities in Hungary launched an investigation in September 2011 after receiving information from Zuroff regarding Csizsik-Csatary's residence in Budapest and his role in the Auschwitz deportations, the center said.  The Sun reported Sunday that when a reporter knocked on the door of Csizsik-Csatary's two-bedroom Budapest apartment and asked him if he could justify his past, "He looked shocked and stammered, 'No, no. Go away.'"  Asked about the deportation case in Canada, the Sun said he replied, "No, no, I don't want to discuss it."  The Sun reporter asked, "Do you deny doing it? A lot of people died as a result of your actions," according to the report.  Csizsik-Csatary replied, "No, I didn't do it. Go away from here," and slammed the door, according to the newspaper.  The Simon Wiesenthal Center said in a statement Sunday that Zuroff last week submitted new evidence to a Budapest prosecutor regarding Csizsik-Csatary and his "key role in the deportation of approximately 300 Jews from Kosice to Kamenetz-Podolsk, Ukraine, where almost all were murdered in the summer of 1941."  "This new evidence strengthens the already very strong case against Csatary and reinforces our insistence that he be held accountable for his crimes," Zuroff said in the statement. "The passage of time in no way diminishes his guilt and old age should not afford protection for Holocaust perpetrators."  Csizsik-Csatary reportedly was convicted of war crimes in absentia and sentenced to death in 1948 in the Czech Republic, Zuroff said, but the center has not obtained documentation on the case.  CNN's Ben Brumfield and journalist Flora Hevesi contributed to this report.

Former NFL star Darren Sharper pleaded not guilty in a Los Angeles court Thursday in the alleged druggings and rapes of two women.  Judge Renee Korn raised Sharper's bail to $1 million from $200,000 in response to a prosecution request to raise it to as high as $10 million.  The judge also ordered Sharper not to frequent clubs, bars or any venue where alcohol is the primary item for sale.  Korn also ordered Sharper "not be alone with any women he does not have a previous relationship with (from) prior to October 30, 2013," the date of the first alleged rape in Los Angeles County.  Sharper has already surrendered his passport, the judge noted.  "Mr. Sharper must stay in Los Angeles County," the judge said.  Sharper, who had been free on bail, stood quietly in a gray pinstripe suit with a black shirt and no tie.  One of his defense attorneys, Blair Berk, said that Sharper was pleading not guilty. Berk has said that she is "hopeful that before the case is concluded that Mr. Sharper will be exonerated."  Leonard Levine, another of Sharper's attorneys, indicated his client would post his residence and his father's residence for the $1 million bail.  The five-time Pro Bowl player, who became an NFL Network analyst, is charged with two counts of rape by use of drugs, four counts of furnishing a controlled substance and one count of possession of a controlled substance, all felonies, according to Los Angeles County prosecutors.  The alleged rapes occurred in October and last month, authorities said.  Sharper also is under investigation in Arizona, Louisiana and Nevada in connection with a total of five alleged rape cases in those states, according to Los Angeles authorities.  Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Stacy Okun-Wiese said in court that Sharper is also being investigated in sexual battery case in a fifth state, in Miami Beach, Florida.  But in court, a Sharper lawyer disputed all the rape allegations.  "It was all consensual contact with women who wanted to be in his company," Levine said.  In unsuccessfully seeking a $10 million bail, the prosecutor argued that "Sharper is a danger to women."  "He hangs out with them in clubs. Takes them back. It's the same story," Okun-Wiese told the court. "He gives them a shot. They black out.  "The next day they have no idea of what happened the previous night," she said.  In the Los Angeles cases, Sharper is accused of using morphine and zolpidemanother name for the prescription sleep aid Ambienon his two alleged victims, who said they blacked after Sharper served them a shot of alcohol, according to authorities.  Okun-Wiese said authorities took count of Sharper's Ambien pills.  "I counted it up and Mr. Sharper has gone through 70 pills in 65 days," the prosecutor said.  When Los Angeles County authorities filed the rape charges last month, they weren't aware of the Nevada and Arizona investigations, Okun-Wiese said.  "The circumstances have changed tremendously since the January 17 arrest" of Sharper in California, Okun-Wiese said.  Defense attorney Levine, however, said "there is no probable cause" against Sharper in those other states' cases.  In the latest accusation, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said.  The alleged victim filed the complaint shortly after an acquaintance told her last month that Sharper was arrested in California on rape charges, the Miami Beach police report says. The alleged Florida victim filed the report because "she felt she needed to clear her conscious," the report said.  According to the police report, in September or October 2012, the woman was with two friends at a Miami Beach club when she met Sharper, and when she, her friends, and another person went to Sharper's condo, the woman was "extremely intoxicated."  The woman's two friends later told her she went with Sharper into his bedroom, and the friends heard her telling Sharper, "No, no, stop. I don't want to," the report said.  The two friends knocked on the bedroom door, entered the room and tried to take the woman home, but because "she was so intoxicated, she can't remember what she said to (the two friends) because her speech was slurred and she wanted to sleep," the report said.  Everyone subsequently left Sharper's Miami Beach condo, except for Sharper and the woman, according to the report.  The woman awoke the following morning, the report said, with Sharper allegedly sexually assaulting her without a condom. The woman was treated by a doctor a week after the incident, the report said.  Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said Thursday.  
 Remember "Bowling for Columbine"?  The anti-gun documentary that attempted to politicize the tragic school shooting at Columbine, Colorado, was wildly successful, both critically and commercially, and even won its writer/director, Michael Moore, an Oscar.  But while the film was certainly entertaining, and may have even got some folks thinking about gun violence, it did little to move the needle on its presumptive goal: curbing gun ownership and weakening the National Rifle Association.  That's because gun owners and the powerful lobby that represents them don't care what Hollywood thinks of them, a lesson producer Harvey Weinstein will learn soon.  Weinstein "reluctantly" told Howard Stern that he's planning a movie that will make the NRA "wish they weren't alive." On Friday night, in an exclusive interview pre-taped with Piers Morgan, he says that none other than Meryl Streep will star as an anti-gun senator.  For so many reasons, Weinstein deserves a good, hard reality check.  For one, there's the obvious and almost comical hypocrisy. Weinstein's profited immensely from portraying graphic gun violence in films such as "Kill Bill" and "Pulp Fiction."  His sudden attack of social conscience is astounding and curiously timed. In the same Morgan interview, he says he'll stop making movies that glamorize guns. But according to Internet Movie Database, "Kill Bill Vol. 3" and "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" are in the works. Maybe he means starting ... now.  For another thing, overtly ideological filmsthink "Rendition" and "Lions for Lambs"bomb at the box office. Theatergoers don't want to be lectured by Hollywood for two hours on what they think is wrong with the country.  Opinion: When will America wake up to gun violence?  If we're to assume Weinstein is motivated by a deep concern about gun violence (and not sheer arrogance), then it's also worth pointing out that he's got the wrong target. The NRA represents law-abiding gun owners, not criminals. A gangbanger in Chicago doesn't care about the NRA, isn't motivated or supported by the NRA, and may not even know what the NRA is. In vowing to take down this powerful organization supported by millions of law-abiding citizens, Weinstein will simply end up empowering and emboldening it.  And lastly, the effort most certainly won't rid the country of guns (a goal he's admitted to having, unless there's another Holocaust in which case he very much wants a gun, or something.)  Back to Michael Moore. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association for the U.S. firearms industry, calculates that from 2002, the year "Bowling for Columbine" came out, to 2011, there's been a 54.1% rise in the number of federal background checks, one way of measuring an increase in gun sales. And remember, that movie was actually successful.  Proving the nation's gun owners not only don't care about Hollywood's dictates but Washington's either, in the year since the tragic Newtown, Connecticut, shootingand despite significant efforts from the Obama administration and other Democrats to push increased gun control, gun sales are up 8%.  Weinstein may find this lamentable and even reprehensible. He's entitled to his opinion. And he's also entitled to spend Hollywood money on a movie in which Meryl Streep is paid to rail against a constitutionally protected right and a robust and defensive American community. But I promise, every penny he makes will be multiplied manyfold in NRA contributions. Good luck, Harvey.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of SE Cupp.  
	 'SE Cupp: Former NFL star Darren Sharper pleaded not guilty in Los Angeles'
Friday, President Barack Obama walked into the White House briefing room and gave the American people his thoughts on the Trayvon Martin case.  His comments were striking in their honesty and in their personal nature.  He didn't lecture. He wasn't angry. He was reflective. He spoke about his personal experiences, and the shared experiences of so many others. He called for respect for the process and the verdict, but used the remarks as an opportunity to help others understand why so many people were angry.  He said that 35 ago, "Trayvon Martin could have been me."  He started a national conversation.  Andin the most predictable and disappointing fashionhe became a lightning rod for criticism from his political opponents. Within moments of his speech, cable news and Twitter was full of comments from the right questioning the president's motives and words.  He was called divisive. He was accused of fanning the flames of discontent. Some said that by raising this issue, he was not being a president for everyone, just for African-Americans.  Those criticisms could not be more sad. Nor could they be more off base. Because while Obama's comments may have been focused on some of the racial divisions we face as a nation, to me his remarks were about so much more.  They were about all of the divisions we face.  There are far too many stereotypes and bigotries that divide us on a daily basis. Far too many people of different backgrounds who feel targeted, mocked, or looked down upon by others.  Obama's comments don't just speak to the young black man who worries he's being followed, or who sees other people look at him with fear. He spoke to the young Sikh-American man who is called a "terrorist" on the street or stared at with fear for wearing a turban publicly.  He spoke to the young Indian-American man, born and raised in this country, who is mocked and called a racial slur and told "welcome to America" by a U.S. senator because his skin color is a little darker.  He spoke to the servicewoman who wears our nation's uniform but finds that the greatest threat might come from male colleagues.  He spoke to the young woman who walks down the street and feels the need to cover up because of all the eyes "checking out" her body.  He spoke to the young Hispanic-American who is assumed to be an illegal immigrant just because of his or her last name.  And yes, he spoke to the white Americans who feel fear that of being robbed when approached by a young black man.  The fact is we do still have divisions in this country based on racism. And sexism. And ageism. And more "isms" than any of us care to admit. So when the president says "Trayvon Martin could have been me," of course that's somewhat about race.  But not entirely.  Those misconceptions about him and the fear Martin felt that night are all too familiar to way too many Americans. Trayvon Martin could have been any of us.  Obama has been the recipient of more than his fair share of attacks. But Friday's werefor mesome of the most disappointing I've witnessed since he took office.  Not everything needs to be a fight. We ought to be able to have nonpoliticized conversations about issues that are this important. Sometimes, rather than throw a punch, it might be more productive to just join the conversation.  Friday was one of those days.  And unless we have more conversations like the one the president advocatesand until we realize it's a conversation that we all are a part ofwe'll won't every fully get to a place where we are finally judged purely on "the content of our character."

 Europe and the Muslim world seem to be on a collision course that could have major political, economic and ideological ramifications. January 23, 2012, may well come to be remembered as the crucial date when Samuel Huntington's "clash of civilizations" thesis, which many of us believed discredited beyond repair, was reaffirmed.  Political scientist Huntington wrote in 1993 that cultural divisions preclude a defining global civilization, and the West and the Muslim world would never share the same values.  Last month, Europe took two different actions that nonetheless sent the same message to the Muslim world: You are not our equals and are doomed to be judged by standards different from those by which we judge ourselves. Future historians might call January 23 the day when Europe irreversibly alienated not one, but both, pivotal powersIran and Turkeythat in all probability will dominate the political landscape of the Middle East for several decades.  One action was the European Union's decision to ban oil purchases from Iran, including imports of crude oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products, to force Tehran to negotiate away its uranium enrichment program, which Tehran insists is for civilian use only. This is the latest in a series of increasingly stringent sanctions that Western powers have unilaterally imposed on Iran. These sanctions go well beyond those required by the U.N. Security Council.  The EU sanctions attempt to hit the Iranian economy where it hurts most: Europe imports about a fifth of Iranian oil. When combined with a ban on transactions with Iran's Central Bank, this action is aimed at paralyzing the Iranian economy.  At the same time, the French Senate passed a law making it a crime to deny genocides that are officially recognized by France. The two genocides in this category are the Holocaust and the killing of 1.5 million Armenians in Anatolia during the last years of the Ottoman Empire. Because the denial of the Holocaust is already a crime under French law, the obvious objective of the bill is to criminalize the denial of the 1915 Armenian genocide.  The issue of Armenian genocide touches a very raw nerve in Turkey, which denies the scale of the killingsTurkey maintains that roughly 500,000 Armenians were killedas well as the claim that it was planned. According to Turkey, the killings happened in the midst of the disarray accompanying World War I and the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey says a nearly equivalent number of Turks and Kurds were also killed in inter-ethnic strife with the Armenians, who were allied with the Ottoman's Russian adversaries.  It's not the accuracy of the opposing claims that is at issue; it's Muslim perceptions. Iran may well be trying to develop nuclear weapons, and what amounts to an Armenian genocide may well have taken place. What roils Muslim opinion worldwide is the perception that the West uses blatant double standards to pass judgment.  Harsh sanctions on Iran are seen as an attempt to prevent a Muslim country from developing deterrents to attacks from Israel and the United States, both nuclear powers hostile to the Islamic Republic. Most Western discussions of the Iranian bomb do not make even passing reference to the well-documented Israeli nuclear capability, even as Israel threatens to militarily strike Iran's nuclear facilities. This omission is seen as hypocritical, dishonest and self-serving.  For many in the Muslim world, double standards explain why France singled out Turkey, and didn't criminalize the denial of other nations' crimes against humanity. Although denying Germany's crimes is a crime, the Holocaust is universally accepted as genocide, while Turkey's is not.  Many ask why disputing European massacres of non-European people is not criminalizedsuch as the French actions in Algeria, as Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan has said. These would include the near-total extermination of native populations by European settlers in Australia, New Zealand, and North America.  They would include the killings of millions of people by the Belgian administration of the Congo Free State, whose population was halved during the early decades of Belgian rule. Most pertinent of all, Muslims ask, why not criminalize the denial of the genocidal Spanish Inquisition that led to the extermination, expulsion or conversion of the entire Muslim and Jewish populations of the Iberian peninsula?  Many Muslims perceive these moves as the West targeting Iran and Turkey in an attempt to prevent important Muslim countries from achieving the military capacityIranand the political statureTurkeythey deserve. Many see behind these moves the not-so-hidden hand of an ideology based on Huntington's theory of the clash of civilizations. Although these perceptions may not fully conform with reality, it is well established that perceptions count much more than reality in the conduct of international relations.

All eyes are on Pakistani teenager Malala Yousafzai as the favorite to win the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. But there's another top contender, according to the bookmakers. That man is Denis Mukwege, a pioneering doctor from the Democratic Republic of Congo who has dedicated his life to helping rape victims.  Mukwege, 58, is the medical director of Panzi Hospital in the eastern Congo, which has been plagued by conflict for nearly two decades.  In a nation that has been ripped apart by war, the Panzi Hospitalnestled in the hills above the Congolese town of Bukavuprovides a rare sanctuary for women who have been raped. Many travel hundreds of miles to have both their physical and psychological wounds healed by Mukwege.  The use of rape as a weapon of war in DR Congo has been widely reported. Although exact figures are unavailable, the U.N. estimates that more than 200,000 Congolese women are rape survivors.  Read more: Congo beyond the conflict  Many of the women Mukwege treats have been so violently attacked that they suffer permanent internal damage.  At his hospital, women are treated for vaginal fistulaa muscular tear caused by violent rapeand are also given counseling and treatment for the psychological repercussions of their experiences.  Mukwege thinks that fistula is one of the worst conditions a woman can experience: "A fistula is dramatic for a woman," he told CNN in a 2009 interview. "Everywhere she goes people don't want to be around her and reject her, so it's a disease that is worse than leprosy."  Mukwege's career has spanned more than 20 years, during which time he has treated tens of thousands of women.  The women at Panzi Hospital view Mukegwe as a father. "I may be the only one to whom they can express what they feel ," he said. "Sometimes it's important to help them heal psychologically and tell them: 'You are not destroyed. They wanted to destroy you, but you are still a woman. You are a woman and you need to be strong.'"  In October 2012, armed men broke into his house, held his daughters at gunpoint and waited for him to return home. When he arrived home his security guard attempted to intervene and was shot dead. Mukwege threw himself to the ground and narrowly missed being shot.  Mukwege then took his family to safety in Brussels. When he returned to Bukavu in January this year he was given a warm welcome by the communityhis patients had raised funds to pay for his return ticket by selling pineapples and onions.  Mukwege was born in 1955, the third of nine children. He studied medicine in the DRC before traveling to France to specialize in gynecology, after seeing the complications resulting from childbirth in his home country.  He has won multiple prizes for his work, including the U.N. Human Rights Prize in 2008.  Mukwege told CNN he had never considered going abroad for more pay and better working conditions. "Work is not only about money," he said. "Earning money is not the sum total of life. Life is not about living in abundance, it's about what you can give to somebody else."  
 EL DORADO HILLS, California The attorney for Nancy Garrido, charged in the Jaycee Lee Dugard abduction case, expressed concern Wednesday that intense media coverage may prejudice his client's ability to get a fair trial.  Phillip Garrido and his wife in 1988, shortly after his release from jail for rape.  "There have been some misstatements made in the media, and possibly very innocent misstatements like, you know, 'She's charged with 29 counts, she was there, therefore she must be culpable,' " Gilbert Maines told CNN's "American Morning" on Wednesday.  "That's good speculation, but any good prosecutor will tell you that they can't prosecute and convict on speculation.  "The media can do that, but the prosecutor can't."  Watch Maines talk about Nancy Garrido's case   Nancy and Phillip Garrido have been charged in connection with the kidnapping and rape of Dugard, 29, who police say was abducted by the Garridos in 1991 at age 11.  Dugard grew up in a backyard compound of tents and outbuildings, and gave birth to two daughters, now 11 and 15, fathered by Garrido during her captivity, police said.  The Garridos were arrested last week and have pleaded not guilty. Philip Garrido is a registered sex offender.  Maines said his client has been charged with "about half" of the 29 counts against the couple. He said he has discussed "what she says happened." He would not elaborate, citing attorney-client privilege. But, he added, he is still "trying to establish a line of communication" with his client.  "We are in the process of formulating any defense that we have, or that we may have," he said. "We are still in the process of investigating this entire thing."  Maines said he was not aware of the case before he was appointed by the court to represent Nancy Garrido.  "I'm sure you understand that this is a horrendous thing for her," Maines said. "I mean I realize it's horrendous for Jaycee and her parents and the children, but my concern right now is that my client get a fair trial."  He said that he is still working on getting his client to "confide in me and talk to me so I can formulate any defense that is available."

The United States is failing its partners. If you want to understand one of the reasons that terrorism has been allowed to spread, it is that the majority of our partners do not have credible and capable special operations forces to respond to and defeat the current threatand we're not doing nearly enough to address the problem.  The trouble is that little of our foreign military financingincluding the recent Counterterrorism Partnership Fundsgoes toward this vital facet in our efforts to counter extremism. As a result, violent extremists are making troubling gains.  It's not because we don't recognize the problemnor that we don't talk the talk.  The 2015 National Security Strategy speaks to the importance of American-led partnerships, while the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review noted that we "will rebalance our counterterrorism efforts toward greater emphasis on building partnership capacity."  Despite this apparent recognition, the United States is not where it needs to be and instead finds itself constantly responding to crises instead of heading them off because of the failure to prioritize long-term investment in special operations units in key partner nations.  As a result of this neglect, since the attacks of September 11, 2001, we have seen deadly terrorist attacks not just in the Middle East, but also in Indonesia, India and sub-Saharan Africa. Just look at the case of Kenya.  On September 21, 2013, Al-Shabaab jihadists attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, executing dozens of unarmed men, women, and children. Less than two years later, at Garissa University, Al-Shabaab jihadists attacked university dormitories, butchering almost 150 people. The perpetrators were separating the Christians from the Muslims and systemically executing the Christians before detonating their suicide vests. During both incidents, the Kenyan forces' response was horribly executed.  Sadly, Kenya is not the exceptionand it is by no means the only country missing out on vital U.S. assistance.  In 2015, U.S. taxpayers are providing $5.65 billion in foreign military finance, the majority of which is going to Israel and Egypt. Kenya, meanwhile, was slated to receive a mere $1.2 million. Nigeria, which is grappling with the rising threat of violent extremists in the shape of Boko Haram, has been afforded only $600,000.  Simply put, the United States is spreading foreign military assistance too thin, while also failing to make necessary long-term commitments. It takes years to build special operations forces with credible capabilities. But although it is a worthwhile investment in terms of resources and energy, U.S. security assistance is not supporting enduring programs that build credible special operations partners.  The reality is that we are not selling or giving our partners the capabilities that are critical to defeating the imminent threats they face today in hybrid warfare.  We are also failing to develop long-term programs of record, bringing to bear all elements of national power as we did with Plan Colombia. This program, as well as the recent U.S. mission to support our Filipino partners against Abu Sayyaf, demonstrates the power of a persistent presence by U.S. Special Forces when coupled with long-term funding and true interagency cooperation.  True, the Section 1206 Global Train and Equip program fulfills some needs, but money from the program only provides limited supportit is an annual appropriation for "new and emerging" counterterrorist operations or to support military and stability operations in which the U.S. armed forces are a participant. Another program that builds special operations capacity, the Joint Combined Exchange and Training program, is also insufficient because it is ad hoc and meant to train U.S. forces first and foremost, not our partners.  With all this in mind, it is clearly time for Congress to step in and develop a dedicated program that builds out special operations in key nations to help bring the fight to the violent extremists in their own backyards. By investing everywhere, we are investing nowhere, which is why we need to make choices about where the United States and its allies will see maximum benefit.  The United States has a choicereinforce failure and keep doing what we are doing or change course while we still have time. But to get this right, Congress needs to start out by conducting hearings to find out in detail what current programs are providing to defeat imminent threats.  This will mean asking the Departments of State and Defense to lay out a detailed budget with necessary metrics to show what capabilities these programs will provide to counter hybrid threats and when those capabilities will be complete. At the same time, Congress needs to move beyond annual appropriations so that State and Defense planners can do their job, too.  Attacks such as Mumbai and Westgate are easy to plan, do not require large amounts of ordinance and can be done in almost any location in the worldwe can expect to see a lot more of these. But with competent and capable partners who are interoperable with other special operations forces and law enforcement, we can start to make progress.  It goes without saying that special operations forces are not a panacea for defeating terrorism, the causes of which are complex and diverse. But having credible special operations forces is a great first step.  And for many of our partner nations, the special operations capability we give them may be the best chance they have at protecting their populations from extremists at home.  
 Film director David Lynch has confirmed he will no longer direct the revival of "Twin Peaks"a cult 1990s television show that was set to return in 2016.  The offbeat TV series, created by Lynch and Mark Frost, featured a quirky FBI agent who went to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the mysterious murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer.  The groundbreaking series is considered one of the most influential shows in television history.  Lynch broke the news about his departure in a series of tweets, saying that the show's third season will continue without him. He said he felt the network was not offering enough money to produce the show "the way it needed to be done."  Lynch also wrote that he had personally called the actors over the weekend to let them know he would no longer be directing.  Showtime Network, which will air the nine-episode comeback, released a statement saying they were "saddened" by Lynch's decision.  "We were saddened to read David Lynch's statement today since we believed we were working towards solutions with David and his reps on the few remaining deal points," read the statement.  "Showtime also loves the world of Twin Peaks and we continue to hold out hope that we can bring it back in all its glory with both of its extraordinary creators, David Lynch and Mark Frost, at its helm."  Showtime announced they would produce a third season in October last year.  Actor Kyle MacLachlan, who played the coffee-obsessed FBI agent Dale Cooper in the original series, had confirmed he would reprise the lead role for the new season.

No Googling allowed:  Who are Koichi Wakata, Oleg Kotov, Mike Hopkins, Mikhail Tyurin, Rick Mastracchio and Sergey Ryazanskiy?  If you're stumped by the question, don't feel bad. You're not alone.  Most people almost certainly wouldn't know the answer. Although it would be nice if we did.  Those six men are people of great accomplishment, rigorous education and training, and astonishing courage.  Right this moment, they are taking part in something so thrilling that it's hard to believe the world has become so indifferent to it.  They are the six inhabitants of the International Space Station. Living together hundreds of miles above the surface of the Earth, they circle the globe every 90 minutes. They travel at a speed of 17,500 miles per hour every second of every day.  But except when there is a potential crisis on the Space Station, such as the problem with the cooling system over the holidays, most people are barely aware that they are up there.  Their mission is like something Ian Fleming would have dreamed up in an old James Bond novel:  Five different space agencies from nations across the Earth, cooperating to populate and support a self-contained outposta colony the size of a football fieldthat circles endlessly above us at unimaginable velocity.  An international team of intrepid explorers living in space, conducting experiments and research and gazing through the blackness toward the rest of us. The International Space Station has been continuously occupied by different teams of astronauts and cosmonauts for more than 13 years.  Americans once knew by heart the names of the original astronauts. Alan Shepard, John Glenn, Gus Grissom and their colleagues were as celebrated as any baseball heroes had been in generations that preceded theirs.  Life on Earth came to a complete, pulse-pounding standstill when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first stepped onto the surface of the moon.  The fascination somehow faded during the space shuttle years. Unless there was a tragedy, as happened with Challenger and Columbiaand with the exception of the shuttle mission on which Glenn, at age 77, became a crew membermost of the shuttle flights drew little more than a national glance or two.  It may have had to do with the fact that in an age when television images were king, the shuttles, for all the dangers they presented to their dedicated crews, on TV appeared more like giant commercial airliners than exotic spacecraft as they returned to make their landings. The very name"shuttle"sounded deceptively routine, although the missions were anything but.  Whatever the reason, it seemed more difficult, during the space shuttle era, to get the public especially interested.  The International Space Station, for all its jaw-dropping technological capabilities, and for all the bravery of its resident astronauts, has faced an even bigger hurdle in attracting the attention of the constantly distracted people of Earth. Because the space station has been up there so long, people seldom pause to consider the wonder of it all.  In recent days, though, it has been in the news.  NASA announced this month that the space station will continue circling the Earth for at least four years beyond its previously planned splashdown in 2020. Now, it will be inhabited until at least 2024.  And last week the six occupants of the space station finally received their Christmas gifts. The presents from their families, along with crates of supplies, were supposed to be delivered last month, but were delayed.  The cooling system breakdown had held things up, and then there was an explosion on the sun that unleashed particles that could have caused problems during the transport. (And you think you had a creative excuse for being late to work.)  The gifts and supplies that eventually made it to the station, by the way, were delivered not by NASA but by a for-hire private company. Two such companies, Orbital Sciences Corp. and SpaceX, are contracted to fly supplies to the International Space Station.  Even that fact plays into the misguided perception down on Earth that the space station is, if not ho-hum, then not the stuff of tingling drama. There are already plans for privately owned "space taxis" to take future astronauts to and from the station, a far cry from the breathless years of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.  When the unmanned courier craft arrived last week, the space station residents belatedly opened their Christmas presents. (Incidentally, included in that cargo delivery was a container of live ants. Eight hundred or so of them. It has something to do with an experiment about weightlessness. Just what you would most like to unwrap when you're in a confined area in space, right? Ants.)  One measure of the public's attentiveness toward the astronauts of today can be seen in the audience for the Twitter feed of Mastracchio, one of the two Americans up there.  He does, indeed, tweetcircling the Earth, he sends down messages and descriptions so citizens of the world (those with a computer, smartphone or tablet), can in real time and for free be kept up on what is transpiring aboard that miraculous mission. It is a way of instant and intimate communication from space that wouldn't even have been dreamed of not so long ago.  He has 36,300 Twitter followers.  For comparison's sake, Justin Bieber has 48.7 million followers for the Twitter account of his daily doings.  LeBron James has 11.2 million.  Katy Perry has 49.5 million.  We can get used to just about anything, or so it seems, but it's instructive that we have gotten so used to even this: humans from different countries living in harmony as they hurtle perilously through the dark void so far from Earth.  Walter Cronkite is no longer around to tell a breathlessly waiting world of such exploits in space. But if astronaut Mastracchio wants more people to know about the astounding things he is seeing and experiencing up there, perhaps he can prevail upon Justin Bieber to retweet him.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.  
 A small mammal with fluffy red-orange fur, a short bushy tail, and an adorable rounded face has leapt onto the raccoon family tree.  Scientists at the Smithsonian in Washington announced Thursday the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito (pronounced oh-lin-GHEE-toe). If you're a fan of long technical names, this one is Bassaricyon neblina.  Such a discovery is rare. The olinguito is the first mammalian carnivore species to be newly identified in the Americas in 35 years, according to Kristofer Helgen, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. His research group's study on the creature is being published in the journal ZooKeys.  Researchers argue that the olinguito should be considered the smallest living member of the raccoon family, which includes other animals that make us go "awww" such as coatis and kinkajous. The Smithsonian describes the olinguito's appearance as a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear. Cats, bears, and olinguitos belong to the Carnivora order.  This animal had been seen before by humans, Helgen said, but it had been "a case of mistaken identity."  "It was in museums, it's been in zoos, and its DNA had even been sequenced, but no one had connected the pieces and looked close enough to realize, basically, the significance of this remarkable and this beautiful animal," Helgen said.  Previously, scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species, the olingos, Helgen said. Olingos are larger, less furry and have longer faces than the newly discovered species.  Tracking the olinguito  Helgen began his detective work in pursuit of the new species when he set out about a decade ago to comprehensive study of olingos.  Behind the scenes at the Chicago Field Museum in 2003, he remembers pulling out a drawer of skins and skulls that didn't look like any animal he had ever seen before, or that had been reported by zoologists. The teeth and skull were smaller and shaped differently than olingos, and the coat was denser.  Records indicated to Helgen that such specimens came from the northern Andes about 5,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level, which is much higher than olingo habitats.  Helgen and colleagues worked with Miguel Pinto, a zoologist in Ecuador, who had shot a few seconds of video that appeared to depict the animal.  They teamed up in Ecuador in 2006, using Pinto's knowledge of cloud forest habitats to pick the best spots to investigate. Cloud forests are "cloaked in fog," Helgen said.  On their very first night on the pursuit, the team found a real, living olinguito.  Seeing the fluffy tree-dweller for the first time, Helgen felt "sheer elation, just incredible excitement but at the same time almost disbelief. This animal had been missed by everyone."  Even people who live in the Andes had the same confusion about olinguitos being olingos, because humans don't hunt them and the creatures stay in the trees, Helgen said.  Ancient primate could be a missing link  How it lives  The researchers found out that the olinguito primarily eats fruits, but also insects and nectar, and its activity is mostly at night. The animal lives in the trees and can jump from one to another. Mothers raise a single baby at a time.  At about 2.5 feet long from nose tip to tail tip, the olinguito weighs about 2 pounds and is a little smaller than a house cat.  DNA analysis confirmed that while olinguitos and olingos both belong to the raccoon family, they are "sister groups," in the same way that humans are closely related to chimpanzees.  The olinguito's misty high-elevation habitats in Colombia and Ecuador, and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees, have helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists until now, Helgen said.  It turns out, according to Helgen, there are four subspecies of olinguitos, differing in colorshades of reds, orange and brownsand size and living in various sections of the Andes.  New species of mice, bats and shrews are more commonly discovered, but these animals are tiny and hard to tell apart, Helgen said.  Prior to the olinguito, the most recent mammal to be discovered in the Americas was a small weasel from the Andesthe same area and habitat where the olinguitos live, he said.  "It shows us that there's a long way to go to exploring the whole world, but especially maybe these cloud forests," Helgen said. More olinguitos may be found in other South American countries with cloud forests in the future, according to the Smithsonian.  The olinguito is not yet considered an endangered species, but there are threats to its home environment, Helgen said. Many have such forests been chopped down.  "We also kind of hope that in telling this story to the world about the olinguito, that this beautiful new animal serves as something of an ambassador for those embattled cloud forest habitats."  The zoo olinguito  Helgen's group has "discovered" the olinguito, but it been evolving as an independent species for about 3 to 4 million years, he said.  One olinguito whose history Helgen's group studied was exhibited in the United States during its lifetime as if it were an olingo. The creature came from the mountains of Colombia to the Louisville Zoo in 1967, courtesy of a German couple with a love of raccoon family members, Helgen said. It was also in the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington and the Bronx Zoo, where it passed away.  DNA from this olinguito shows that it is clearly not an olingo, Helgen said.  The wife of the animal's keeper told Helgen, "We always thought there was something strange about that olingo," he said.  She told Helgen this particular animal moved from zoo to zoo because she wouldn't breed with the olingos around her.  "It wasn't because she was fussy, it was because she was not at all even the same species," Helgen said.  With the olinguito research announcement, the oddball animal's aloofness has been vindicated.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored four goals for the first time as Real Madrid retained top spot in Spain with a 6-1 thrashing of Racing Santander on Saturday.  Defending champions Barcelona had briefly gone to the La Liga summit with a 2-0 victory at bottom club Zaragoza thanks to two goals from Lionel Messi, but Ronaldo upstaged the world player of the year as Real ran riot.  The Portugal forward took his tally to 11 goals in 11 games this seasoneight coming in his last three league matches.  Santander came to the Spanish capital just one point above the relegation zone, and tried a defensive line-up of three center-backs which was exposed time and again in the first half.  Gonzalo Higuain put Real ahead in the 10th minute with a calm finish after collecting Angel Di Maria's superb long pass for his fifth league goal this season, then five minutes later he set up Ronaldo's first of the night with a low cross from the right.  Ronaldo made it 3-0 in the 27th minute despite coming from an offside position, sidefooting home again this time with his left foot as Mesut Ozil mirrored Higuain's assist.  Santander switched to a 4-4-2 formation at halftime, but it made no difference as Ronaldo completed his hat-trick two minutes after the break as he showed good balance to turn and guide in a low cross from Di Maria which went behind him.  The world's most expensive player then made it 5-0 from the penalty spot in the 55th minute after Di Maria was brought down just inside the area, and Germany midfielder Ozil put Real further ahead from Xabi Alonso's throughball on 63.  Santander took small consolation 10 minutes later when midfielder Papa Diop's shot took a wicked deflection off the back of teammate Markus Rosenberg, leaving Real captain Iker Casillas helpless in goal.  The victory means Real have scored 16 goals in three league games, and kept Jose Mourinho's unbeaten team one point ahead of Barcelona.  "We've been playing well for several games now, doing a good job overall and pressurising our opponents as a whole team. Individual quality starts to shine through sooner when a team works well collectively," Mourinho told the Real website.  "We have to start working on our game against Murcia [on Tuesday] as of now. Ozil, Carvalho and Xabi Alonso will have a three-day holiday. The rest will be called up for the match. [Karim] Benzema will be a starter, and so will Ronaldo."  Messi took his tally to four goals in a week as he followed up his two-goal effort from Barcelona's 2-0 Champions League win over Copenhagen.  The Argentina forward put the Catalans ahead three minutes before halftime after being set free by Spain striker David Villa's surging run on the counter-attack.  Zaragoza, rock bottom with just three draws from eight matches, then had midfielder Leonardo Ponzio red-carded soon after halftime following an incident also involving Barcelona fullback Dani Alves.  Barca took advantage in the 66th minute as Messi lashed home the loose ball after the home defense failed to clear, while Villa hit the outside of the post later on.  Valencia could have joined Barcelona on 19 points, but lost 2-1 at home to Mallorca in the late match.  The islanders led 2-0 before half an hour had been played as a much-changed home side suffered a second successive league defeat.  Chori Castro netted both goalsthe first a sixth-minute penalty after striker Pierre Webo was clipped from behind, the second an opportunist header after an earlier shot was blocked.  Valencia, who drew 1-1 away to Scottish club Rangers in the Champions League in midweek, pulled one back from the spot in the 35th minute through Roberto Soldado but could not capitalize on an improved second-half showing.  Third-placed Villarreal, who also have 16 points, can move ahead of Barca on goal difference with victory against Atletico Madrid on Sunday  In Saturday's only Italian Serie A match, Fiorentina moved up to 12th place with a 2-1 win at home to Baria result that left both clubs in a bunch of six on eight points, eight behind leaders Lazio.  Midfielder Marco Donadel opened the scoring in the 34th minute and Alberto Gilardino doubled the lead with eight minutes to play before Alessandro Parisi's late consolation.  Former Juventus coach Ciro Ferrara has been named new coach of Italy's Under-21 team, replacing Pierluigi Casiraghi.  
 H. W. Brands is the author of "TR: The Last Romantic" and the just-released "Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt." He teaches history at the University of Texas at Austin.  Historian H.W. Brands says power as well as race was behind controversy over Booker T. Washington.  AUSTIN, Texas In his concession speech on Tuesday night, John McCain illustrated the historic significance of Barack Obama's election by noting that a little over a century ago the inclusion of another black man, Booker T. Washington, at a White House dinner provoked outrage in large parts of the country.  McCain wasn't giving a history lecture, and he quickly moved on, but the tale is worth exploring, as it is both more complex and more instructive than McCain's brief remarks suggested.  Washington was the one who initiated the acquaintance that led to his 1901 dinner with Theodore Roosevelt. Washington had built the Tuskegee Institute of Alabama into a political base that made him the most powerful black leader in the country.  Invited to address the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1895, Washington offered white America a racial bargain: Blacks would cease agitating for immediate political and civil rights if whites would fund black educational and economic advancement.  This "Atlanta Compromise" outraged black intellectuals like W. E. B. Du Bois, but it appealed to white leaders in the South and white philanthropists in the Northand it marked Washington, the broker of Northern largesse and Southern cooperation, as one of the shrewdest politicians in the South.  Washington spotted Roosevelt on the rise, and after Roosevelt became vice president, Washington invited him to Tuskegee, where he knew Roosevelt, the apostle of the strenuous life, would be entranced by the rigorous physical regimen the students pursued.  Roosevelt was preparing to visit Tuskegee when the assassination of William McKinley elevated him to the presidency and threw his plans into turmoil.  Roosevelt instead invited Washington to call at the White House whenever he was in town. Washington didn't have to be asked twice. Within weeks, he was in the capital and was invited to join the president for dinner on October 16.  Roosevelt's ascension to the presidency made him that much more interesting to Washington. Yet no more interesting than Washington was to Roosevelt. The peculiar politics of the Republican Party gave Washington an importance among Republicans that belied the abnegations of the Atlanta Compromise.  Discriminatory Jim Crow laws kept most blacks from voting in the South, but they didn't prevent the Southern states from sending delegations to the Republican national conventions every four years. These delegations could tip the balance in a tight contest, and Rooseveltwho though president was profoundly unpopular among the Republican bossesexpected the 1904 convention to be a tight contest.  Roosevelt's invitation to Washington to dine at the White House had little to do with Washington's race per se, but everything to do with Washington's role as a political boss of Southern Republicans who happened to be black.  Likewise, the outrage expressed by Southern editors and spokesmen over Roosevelt's alleged affront to the South, while couched in the language of race, was really about political power. "White men of the South, how do you like it?" fulminated the New Orleans Times-Democrat. "White women of the South, how do you like it?"  The Richmond Times frothed over the implications of the honor Roosevelt had bestowed on Washington: "It means that the president is willing that Negroes shall mingle freely with whites in the social circlethat white women may receive attentions from negro men; it means that there is no racial reason in his opinion why whites and blacks may not marry and intermarry, why the Anglo-Saxon may not mix negro blood with his blood."  The vehemence of the Southern response gave the game away. Booker Washington had explicitly forsworn any claim to social equality, let alone the right for blacks to marry whites.  What the Southern foamers, political conservatives to a man, feared was that Washington might help the dangerously progressive Roosevelt get elected in his own right. When he did precisely thatRoosevelt fended off the conservatives at the 1904 convention and was returned to office overwhelminglythey foamed the more.  The race question in America has often been about race, but it has equally often been about power. Not for 40 years, since the dismantling of the Jim Crow system, has the race of guests at the White House prompted anything other than idle curiosity. But until last Tuesday those African-Americans among the guests were precisely that: guestsvisitors who lacked the power that occupancy of the White House entails.  Symbolism isn't unimportant, and the symbolism of a black man taking the oath of the president's office in January will certainly bring an outpouring of sentiment like that which greeted Obama's election. But behind the symbolism of race is the reality of power.  Obama will wield power of an order Booker Washington appreciated in Roosevelt but never possessed for himself. A week or a month after the symbolism fades, the reality will remain. At that point, Obama's race won't matter nearly as much as his facility with power.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of H.W. Brands.
